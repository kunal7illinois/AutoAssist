NS–156
NAVIGATION – NAVIGATION SYSTEM
Steering Pad Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
This circuit sends an operation signal from the steering pad switch to the radio and navigation assembly.
If there is an open in the circuit, the navigation system cannot be operated using the steering pad switch.
If there is a short in the circuit, the resulting condition is the same as if the switch were continuously
depressed. Therefore, the radio and navigation assembly cannot be operated using the steering pad
switch, and the radio and navigation assembly itself cannot function.
