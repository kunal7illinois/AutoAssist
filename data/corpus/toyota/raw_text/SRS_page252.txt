DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
CG SG CANH SIL 1. CHECK DLC3
(a) The ECU uses ISO 15765-4 for communication.
The terminal arrangement of the DLC3 complies
RS with SAE J1962 and matches the ISO 15765-4
format.

NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches,
or the door.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
