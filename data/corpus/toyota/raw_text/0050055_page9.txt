ES–307
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
• COMPL indicates that the component is functioning
normally.
• INCMPL indicates that the component is
malfunctioning.
(g) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / MONITOR INFO / TEST RESULT /
RANGE B1 S1; then press the ENTER button.
(h) Check the test value of the A/F sensor output current
during fuel-cut.
Result
Test Value Proceed To
Within normal range (1.0 mA or more, and less than 3.6 mA) A
Outside normal range (Less than 1.0 mA, or 3.6 mA or more) B ES
B Go to step 12
A
3 READ VALUE USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (OUTPUT VOLTAGE OF A/F SENSOR)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Turn the tester ON.
(d) Warm up the A/F sensor at an engine speed of 2,500
rpm for 90 seconds.
(e) On the tester, select the following menu items:
DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / SNAPSHOT /
MANUAL SNAPSHOT / USER DATA / AFS B1 S1 and
ENGINE SPD.
(f) Check the A/F sensor voltage 3 times, when the engine
is in each of the following conditions:
(1) While idling (check for at least 30 seconds)
(2) At an engine speed of approximately 2,500 rpm
(without any sudden changes in engine speed)
(3) Raise the engine speed to 4,000 rpm and then
quickly release the accelerator pedal so that the throttle
valve is fully closed.
Standard voltage
Conditions A/F Sensor Voltage Variations Reference
(1) and (2) Remains at approximately 3.3 V Between 3.1 V and 3.5 V
This occurs during engine deceleration
(3) Increases to 3.8 V or more
(when fuel-cut performed)
