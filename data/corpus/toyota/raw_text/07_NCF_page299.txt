Initial Check
Each time the power source is IG ON*, and the vehicle reaches a speed of approximately 6 km/h (4 mph)
or more, the skid control ECU performs an initial check. The functions of each solenoid valve and pump
motor in the brake actuator are checked in sequence.
*: The power source condition can be changed by operating the engine switch on models with the smart
key system, and the ignition switch on models without the smart key system.
