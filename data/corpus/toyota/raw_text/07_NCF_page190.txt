CH-26 CHASSIS - U250E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
4. Construction and Operation of Main Components
ATF Temperature Sensor
(cid:3) The ATF temperature sensor is installed in the valve body for direct detection of the fluid temperature.
(cid:3) The ATF temperature sensor is used for the revision of clutch and brake pressures to maintain a smooth
shift quality every time.

Speed Sensors
(cid:3) The U250E automatic transaxle uses an input turbine speed sensor (for the NT signal) and a counter gear
speed sensor (for the NC signal). Thus, the ECM can detect the timing of the shifting of the gears and
appropriately control the engine torque and hydraulic pressure in response to the various conditions.
These speed sensors are the pick-up coil type.
(cid:3) The input turbine speed sensor detects the input speed of the transaxle. The direct clutch (C ) drum is

used as the timing rotor for this sensor.
(cid:3) The counter gear speed sensor detects the speed of the counter gear. The counter drive gear is used as
the timing rotor for this sensor.
