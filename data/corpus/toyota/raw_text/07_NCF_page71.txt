EG-44 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
Throttle Position Sensor
The no-contact type throttle position sensor uses a Hall IC, which is mounted on the throttle body.
(cid:1) The Hall IC is surrounded by a magnetic yoke. The Hall IC converts the changes that occur in the
magnetic flux at that time into electrical signals and outputs them in the form of a throttle valve effort
to the ECM.
(cid:1) The Hall IC contains circuits for the main and sub signals. It converts the throttle valve opening angles
into electric signals with two differing characteristics and outputs them to the ECM.

Service Tip
The inspection method differs from the conventional throttle position sensor because this sensor
uses a hall IC. For details, refer to the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
