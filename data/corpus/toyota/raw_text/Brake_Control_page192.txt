BC–186
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
DTC C0278/11 Open in ABS Solenoid Relay Circuit
DTC C0279/12 Short to B+ in ABS Solenoid Relay Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The ABS solenoid relay supplies power to the ABS solenoid and TRAC solenoid.
The solenoid relay is turned on 1.5 seconds after the ignition switch is turned on (IG), and is turned off if
an open or short in the solenoid is detected by self diagnosis performed when the vehicle starts running.
The ABS solenoid relay is housed in the skid control ECU in the actuator assembly.
HINT:
If a speed signal of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more is input to the skid control ECU, with the ignition switch on (IG)
and the stop light switch off, the ECU performs self diagnosis of the motor and solenoid circuits.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When any of the following (1 or 2) is detected:
1. Both of the following conditions continue for 0.2 seconds or more.
• The IG1 terminal voltage is between 9.5 and 17.2 V. • ABS NO. 2 fuse
• The solenoid relay contact is open when the relay is ON. • ABS solenoid relay
BC C0278/11
2. Both of the following conditions continue for 0.2 seconds or more. • ABS solenoid relay circuit
• IG1 terminal voltage becomes lower than 9.5 V or less when the • Brake actuator assembly
relay is turned on.
• The relay contact remains open.
Immediately after the ignition switch is turned on (IG), the solenoid
C0279/12 Brake actuator assembly
relay contact is closed for 0.2 seconds when the relay is turned off.
