2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0171 System Too Lean (Bank 1)
DTC P0172 System Too Rich (Bank 1)
DESCRIPTION
The fuel trim is related to the feedback compensation value, not to the basic injection time. The fuel trim
consists of both the short-term and the long-term fuel trims.
The short-term fuel trim is fuel compensation that is used to constantly maintain the air-fuel ratio at
stoichiometric levels. The signal from the Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor indicates whether the air-fuel ratio is
rich or lean compared to the stoichiometric ratio. This triggers a reduction in the fuel injection volume if the
air-fuel ratio is rich and an increase in the fuel injection volume if it is lean.
ES Factors such as individual engine differences, wear over time and changes in operating environment
cause short-term fuel trim to vary from the central value. The long-term fuel trim, which controls overall
fuel compensation, compensates for long-term deviations in the fuel trim from the central value caused by
the short-term fuel trim compensation.
If both the short-term and long-term fuel trims are lean or rich beyond predetermined values, it is
interpreted as a malfunction, and the ECM illuminates the MIL and sets a DTC.

HINT:
• When DTC P0171 is set, the actual air-fuel ratio is on the lean side. When DTC P0172 is set, the actual
air-fuel ratio is on the rich side.
• If the vehicle runs out of fuel, the air-fuel ratio is lean and DTC P0171 may be set. The MIL is then
illuminated.
• When the total of the short-term and long-term fuel trim values is within 20 % (and the engine coolant
temperature is more than 75°C [167°F]), the system is functioning normally.
