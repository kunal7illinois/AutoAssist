BC–288
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
5. INITIAL CHECK
(a) When the vehicle speed first becomes
approximately 4 mph (6 km/h) or more after the
ignition switch is turned on (IG), each solenoid valve
and motor of the brake actuator assembly is
sequentially activated to perform an electrical
check. During the initial check, the operating sound
of solenoid valve and motor can be heard from the
engine compartment, but this is not a malfunction.
6. FUNCTION OF COMPONENTS
Components Function
• Changes the fluid path based on the signals from the skid control ECU during the operation of
the ABS with EBD & Brake Assist & TRAC & VSC system, in order to control the fluid pressure
Brake actuator assembly
that is applied to the wheel cylinders.
• Houses the skid control ECU.
• Judges the vehicle driving condition based on the signals from each sensor, and controls the
Skid control ECU (housed in brake brake actuator assembly.
actuator assembly) • Sends and receives the control signals to or from the ECM, yaw rate and acceleration sensor,
and steering angle sensor via CAN communication.
BC
• Detects the fluid pressure in the master cylinder.
Master cylinder pressure sensor
• Housed in the brake actuator assembly.
Speed sensor Detects speed of each wheel and inputs the data into the skid control ECU.
Illuminates the brake light when the brake pedal is depressed. (Sends a brake on signal to the skid

control ECU)
• Supplies power to the pump motor.
Motor relay
• Housed in the skid control ECU.
• Supplies power to each solenoid.
Solenoid relay
• Housed in the skid control ECU.
• Controls the engine output based on the signals received from the skid control ECU.
ECM • Sends the accelerator pedal position signal and the engine speed signal to the skid control
ECU.
• Comes on to inform the driver that a malfunction in the ABS, EBD or BA (Brake Assist) has
ABS warning light occurred.
• Blinks to output DTC.
• Comes on to inform the driver that the parking brake is ON when the system is normal.
BRAKE warning light
• Comes on to inform the driver that a malfunction in the EBD has occurred.
VSC warning light Comes on to inform the driver that a malfunction in the VSC system has occurred.
SLIP indicator light Blinks to inform the driver that TRC and VSC are operating.
Brake fluid level warning switch Detects the brake fluid level.
Skid control buzzer Intermittently sounds to inform the driver that the VSC is operating.
• Acceleration sensor measures the capacity of the condenser that changes the distance
between the electrodes depending on G force, which occurs when the vehicle is accelerated,
and converts the measured value into electrical signals.
Yaw rate and acceleration sensor
• Yaw rate sensor detects the vehicle's angular velocity (yaw rate) in the vertical direction based
on the amount and direction of the piezoelectric ceramics deflection.
• Sends signals to the skid control ECU via CAN communication.
• Installed in the steering column.
• Detects the steering amount and direction and sends the signals to the skid control ECU via
CAN communication.
Steering angle sensor
• Has the magnetic resistance element, which detects the rotation of the magnet housed in the
detection gear in order to detect the changes in magnetic resistance and the steering amount
and direction.
