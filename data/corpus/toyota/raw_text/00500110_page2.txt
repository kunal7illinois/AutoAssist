ES–2
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DEFINITION OF TERMS
Terms Definition
Description of what ECM monitors and how detects malfunctions (monitoring purpose and
Monitor Description
details).
Group of diagnostic trouble codes that are output by ECM based on same malfunction
Related DTCs
detection logic.
Preconditions that allow ECM to detect malfunctions.
Typical Enabling Condition With all preconditions satisfied, ECM sets DTC when monitored value(s) exceeds
malfunction threshold(s).
Order of monitor priority, applied if multiple sensors and components involved in single
malfunction detection process.
Sequence of Operation
Each sensor and component monitored in turn, when previous detection operation
completed.
ES
Required Sensor/Components Sensors and components used by ECM to detect each malfunction.
Number of times ECM checks for each malfunction during each driving cycle.
"Once per driving cycle" means ECM only performs checks for that malfunction once
Frequency of Operation during single driving cycle.
"Continuous" means ECM performs checks for that malfunction whenever enabling
conditions met.
Minimum time for which ECM must detect continuous deviation in monitored value(s) in
Duration
order to set DTC. Timing begins when Typical Enabling Conditions met.
Malfunction Thresholds Value, beyond which, ECM determines malfunctions exist and sets DTCs.
Timing of MIL illumination after malfunction detected.
"Immediate" means ECM illuminates MIL as soon as malfunction detected.
MIL Operation
"2 driving cycle" means ECM illuminates MIL if same malfunction detected second time
during next sequential driving cycle.
