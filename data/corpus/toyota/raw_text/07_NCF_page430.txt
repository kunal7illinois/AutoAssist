Service Tip
The main body ECU constantly stores the present power source state in its memory. Therefore, if
the power to main body ECU is interrupted due to the removal of the battery, the main body ECU
restores the power source after the battery is reconnected.
For this reason, if the battery is removed when the engine switch is in a state other than OFF, the
power will be restored to the vehicle at the same time the power is restored to main body ECU (by
reconnecting the battery).
Therefore, before removing the battery, be sure to turn the engine switch OFF.
