CH-144 CHASSIS - TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
5. Self-Diagnosis
If malfunctions are detected in the system, the tire pressure warning system ECU warns the driver by
illuminating the tire pressure warning light after blinking it at 1 Hz intervals for 1 minute, and stores the DTC
(Diagnostic Trouble Code) in the memory.
The DTC that are stored by the tire pressure warning system ECU can be accessed by connecting the SST
(09843-18040) to the DLC3 terminals TC and CG, and reading the blinking of the tire pressure warning light.
They can also be accessed by connecting a hand-held tester. The table below lists the DTC that pertain to this
system. For further details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub No. RM0250U).
Service Tip
After the DTC have been detected, it is necessary to identify the wheel that contains the faulty tire
pressure warning system valve & transmitter. It can be identified by performing the operation in
accordance with the prescribed procedure. For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No.
RM0250U)
