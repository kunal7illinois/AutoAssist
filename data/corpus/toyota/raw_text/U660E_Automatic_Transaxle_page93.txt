AX–93
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
Pressure Control Solenoid "B" Performance
DTC P0776
(Shift Solenoid Valve SL2)
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The TCM uses the vehicle speed signal to detect the actual gear position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th
AX
gear).
Then the TCM compares the actual gear with the shift schedule in the TCM memory to detect shift
solenoid valves and valve body mechanical problems.
DTC No. DTC Detecting Condition Trouble Area
The engine revs freely when 4th, 5th, or 6th gear is
requested (2-trip detection logic).
When any of the following is detected twice (2-trip • Shift solenoid valve SL2 remains open or closed
P0776 detection logic): • Valve body is blocked
• When 1st gear is requested, 4th gear is engaged. • Automatic transaxle (clutch, brake or gear etc.)
• When 2nd gear is requested, 4th gear is engaged.
• When 3rd gear is requested, 4th gear is engaged.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The TCM commands gear shifts by turning the shift solenoid valves on or off. According to the input shaft
revolution, intermediate (counter) shaft revolution and output shaft revolution, the TCM detects the actual
gear position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th gear position). When the gear position commanded by the
TCM and the actual gear position are not the same, the TCM illuminates the MIL and stores the DTC.
