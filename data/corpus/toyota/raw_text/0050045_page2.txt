INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• The following troubleshooting flowchart is based on the premise that the engine is cranked normally.
If the engine will not crank, proceed to the problem symptoms table (see page ES-24).
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 READ VALUE USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (STARTER SIGNAL)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the tester ON.
