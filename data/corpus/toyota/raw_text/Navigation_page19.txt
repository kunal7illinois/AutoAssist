1. Radio Description
(a) Radio frequency band
(1) Radio broadcasts use the radio frequency bands
shown in the table below.
Frequency 30 kHz 300 kHz 30 MHz 30 MHz 300 MHz
Designation LF MF HF VHF
AM FM
Radio Wave
Modulation Amplitude modulation Frequency modulation
LF: Low Frequency MF: Medium Frequency HF: High Frequency VHF: Very High Frequency

(b) Service area
(1) The service areas of AM and FM broadcasts are
vastly different. Sometimes an AM broadcast
can be received very clearly but an FM stereo
cannot. FM stereo has the smallest service area,
and is prone to pick up static and other types of
interference such as noise.
(c) Radio reception problems
FM (Stereo)
HINT:
In addition to static, other problems such as
FM (Monaural) "phasing", "multipath", and "fade out" exist. These
problems are not caused by electrical noise, but by
AM the radio signal propagation method itself.

(1) Phasing
Phasing AM broadcasts are susceptible to electrical
interference and another kind of interference
called phasing. Occurring only at night, phasing
Ionosphere is the interference created when a vehicle
receives 2 radio wave signals from the same
transmitter. One signal is reflected off the
ionosphere and the other signal is received NS
directly from the transmitter.
