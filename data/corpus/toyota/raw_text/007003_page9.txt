15. INSPECT EXHAUST VALVE GUIDE BUSH
(a) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inside diameter
of the guide bush.
Standard bush inside diameter:
5.510 to 5.530 mm (0.2169 to 0.2177 in.)
If the inside diameter is not as specified, replace the
exhaust valve guide bush.
(b) Subtract the valve stem diameter measurement
from the guide bush inside diameter measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
A013367E01
0.030 to 0.065 mm (0.0012 to 0.0026 in.)
Maximum oil clearance:
0.10 mm (0.004 in.)
If the clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the valve and exhaust valve guide bush.
16. INSPECT CYLINDER HEAD SET BOLT
EM
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the length of the
Length
head bolts from the seat to the end.
Standard bolt length:
141.3 to 142.7 mm (5.563 to 5.618 in.)
Maximum bolt length:
144.2 mm (5.677 in.)
If the bolt length is greater than the maximum,
replace the cylinder head set bolt.

17. INSPECT EXHAUST MANIFOLD
(a) Using a precision straightedge and a feeler gauge,
measure the surface contacting the cylinder head
for warpage.
Maximum warpage:
0.70 mm (0.028 in.)
If the warpage is greater than the maximum, replace
the exhaust manifold.
