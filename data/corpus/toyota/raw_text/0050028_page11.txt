Following the A/F CONTROL procedure enables technicians to check and graph the voltage outputs of
both the A/F and HO2 sensors.
To display the graph, select the following menu items on the tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II /
ACTIVE TEST / A/F CONTROL / USER DATA / AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2; then press the YES button
ES
and then the ENTER button followed by the F4 button.
HINT:
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
• If the OX1B wire from the ECM connector is short-circuited to the +B wire, DTC P0138 will be set.
