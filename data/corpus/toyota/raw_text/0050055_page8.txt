2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Following the A/F CONTROL procedure enables technicians to check and graph the voltage outputs of
both the A/F and HO2 sensors.
To display the graph, select the following menu items on the tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II /
ACTIVE TEST / A/F CONTROL / USER DATA / AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2, and press the YES button
and then the ENTER button followed by the F4 button.
HINT:
• DTC P2A00 may be set when the air-fuel ratio is stuck rich or lean.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
• A low A/F sensor voltage could be caused by a rich air-fuel mixture. Check for conditions that would
cause the engine to run rich.
ES
• A high A/F sensor voltage could be caused by a lean air-fuel mixture. Check for conditions that would
cause the engine to run lean.
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO P2195 OR P2196)
(a) Connect an intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
(c) Turn the tester ON.
(d) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC Output) Proceed To
P2195 or P2196 A
P2195 or P2196 and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs relating to the A/F sensor (DTCs for the A/F
sensor heater or A/F sensor admittance) are output,
troubleshoot those DTCs first.
B GO TO DTC CHART
A
2 READ VALUE USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (TEST VALUE OF A/F SENSOR)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the tester ON.
(c) Clear DTCs (see page ES-35).
(d) Drive the vehicle in accordance with the drive pattern
described in the CONFIRMATION DRIVING PATTERN.
(e) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / MONITOR INFO / MONITOR
STATUS.
(f) Check that the status of O2S MON is COMPL.
If the status is still INCMPL, drive the vehicle according
to the driving pattern again.
HINT:
• AVAIL indicates that the component has not been
monitored yet.
