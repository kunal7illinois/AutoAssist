CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-125
VSC Operation
1) General
The VSC operation, by way of solenoid valves, controls the fluid pressure that is generated by the pump
and applies it to the brake wheel cylinder of each wheel in the following 3 modes: pressure reduction,
pressure holding, and pressure increase modes. As a result, the tendency to front wheel skid or rear wheel
skid is controlled.
