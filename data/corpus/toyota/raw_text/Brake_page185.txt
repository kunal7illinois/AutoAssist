BC–179
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
1 RECONFIRM DTC
HINT:
These codes are detected when a problem is determined in
the brake actuator assembly.
The solenoid circuits are in the brake actuator assembly.
Therefore, solenoid circuit inspection and solenoid unit
inspection cannot be performed. Be sure to check if any DTC
code is output before replacing the brake actuator assembly.
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-141).
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Drive the vehicle at the speed of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more.
(d) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-141).

DTCs (C0226/21, C0236/22, C0246/23, C0256/24 and/or C1225/25) are output B
HINT:
• If a speed signal of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more is input to
the skid control ECU, with the ignition switch on (IG)
and the stop light switch off, the ECU performs self
diagnosis of the motor and solenoid circuits.
• If the normal system code is output (the trouble code
is not output), slightly jiggle the connectors, wire
harness, and fuses of the brake actuator assembly.
Make sure that no DTCs are output.
• If any DTCs are output while jiggling a connector or
wire harness of the brake actuator assembly (skid
control ECU), inspect and repair the connector or wire
harness.
