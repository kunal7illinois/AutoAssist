is normal.
*2: If the ambient temperature is approx. -52.9°C (-63.22°F)
or lower, DTC B1412/12 may be output even though the
system is normal.
*3: If the check is performed in a dark place, DTC B1421/21
or B1424/24 (solar sensor circuit abnormal) may be output
AC even though the system is normal.
*4: The A/C amplifier memorizes the DTC of the respective
