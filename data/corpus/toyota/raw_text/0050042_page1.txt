The battery temperature sensor installed on the battery current sensor detects battery temperature.
A thermistor is integrated into the battery temperature sensor, and the resistance in the battery
temperature sensor changes according to the battery temperature.
The resistance of the thermistor in the battery temperature sensor decreases as the battery temperature
increases. The resistance increases as the temperature decreases.
The battery temperature sensor is connected to the ECM. The ECM supplies 5 V from the THB terminal to
the battery temperature sensor through resistor R.
The battery temperature sensor and resistor R are connected in series. This results in fluctuations in the
voltage supplied from the THB terminal when the resistance changes according to the battery
temperature.
The ECM determines the battery temperature according to fluctuations in voltage. When the battery
temperature is high, the ECM determines to reduce the amount of current supplied from the generator in
order to protect the battery.
