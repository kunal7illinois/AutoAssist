RS–224
SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM – AIRBAG SYSTEM
SRS Warning Light Remains ON
DESCRIPTION
The SRS warning light is located on the combination meter assembly.
When the SRS is normal, the SRS warning light comes on for approximately 6 seconds after the ignition
switch is turned from off to on (IG), and then goes off automatically.
If there is a malfunction in the SRS, the SRS warning light comes on to inform the driver of a problem.
When terminals TC and CG of the DLC3 are connected, the DTC is displayed by blinking of the SRS
warning light.
The SRS is equipped with a voltage-increase circuit (DC-DC converter) in the center airbag sensor
assembly in case the source voltage drops.
When the battery voltage drops, the voltage-increase circuit (DC-DC converter) functions to increase the
voltage of the SRS to normal voltage.
A malfunction in this circuit is not recorded in the center airbag sensor assembly. The SRS warning light
automatically goes off when the source voltage returns to normal.
The signal to illuminate the SRS warning light is transmitted from the center airbag sensor assembly to
the combination meter assembly through the CAN communication system.
