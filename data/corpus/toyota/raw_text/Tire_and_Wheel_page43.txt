DESCRIPTION
The tire pressure warning valve and transmitters that are installed in the tire and wheel assemblies
measure the air pressure of the tires. The measured values are transmitted to the tire pressure warning
antenna and receiver on the body as radio waves and then sent to the tire pressure warning ECU. The
ECU compares the measured air pressure values with the air pressure threshold. When the measured air
pressure value is less than this threshold, the warning light in the combination meter comes on.
The tire pressure warning valve and transmitters constantly send radio waves to the tire pressure warning
antenna and receiver.
Under the following conditions below, the tire pressure warning antenna and receiver is unable to receive
the signals from the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters, and a DTC is stored.
• Facilities or devices that use similar radio frequencies are located in the vicinity of the vehicle.
• Devices using similar radio frequencies are used in the vehicle.
HINT:
When no signals are received for 51 minutes or more, a DTC is output.
DTCs from C2121/21 to C2125/25 can only be cleared by using the tester. DTCs from C2181/81 to
C2184/84 or C2185/85 can be cleared when the transmitter in the tire pressure warning valve and
transmitter sends a forced transmission signal or test mode ends. DTCs from C2181/81 to C2184/84 or
C2185/85 are output only in test mode.
