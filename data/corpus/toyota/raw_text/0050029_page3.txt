INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
• A low A/F sensor voltage could be caused by a rich air-fuel mixture. Check for conditions that would
cause the engine to run rich.
• A high A/F sensor voltage could be caused by a lean air-fuel mixture. Check for conditions that would
cause the engine to run lean.
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0171 OR P0172)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the tester ON.
(c) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(d) Read DTCs.
