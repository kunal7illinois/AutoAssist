1. DESCRIPTION
(a) A maximum of three codes for transmitter code
based systems such as garage doors, gates, and
entry gates can be registered to the vehicle's
garage door opener system. These stored codes
can then be used to activate the transmitter
controlled systems. It will not be necessary to keep
the original handheld transmitters in the vehicle.
