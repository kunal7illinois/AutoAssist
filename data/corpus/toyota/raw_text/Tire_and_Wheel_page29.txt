TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
3. DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
(a) DTCs (Normal mode)
(1) DTCs are memorized in the tire pressure
warning ECU and read by the blinks of the tire
pressure warning light or by using the intelligent
tester (See page TW-28).
(b) Test mode
(1) By switching from normal mode into test mode
(input signal check), you can inspect the tire
pressure warning antenna and receiver, each
tire pressure warning valve and transmitter, and
vehicle speed sensor (See page TW-20).
4. CHECK WARNING LIGHT
(a) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(b) Check that the tire pressure warning light comes on
for 3 seconds.
