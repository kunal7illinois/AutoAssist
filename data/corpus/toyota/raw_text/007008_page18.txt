2AZ-FE ENGINE MECHANICAL – ENGINE UNIT
(d) Using a micrometer, measure the piston diameter at
right angles to the piston pin hole, and at the piston
44.3 mm (1.7587 in.) from the piston head.
Standard piston diameter:
88.477 to 88.487 mm (3.5125 to 3.5129 in.)
If the diameter is not as specified, replace the
piston.
4. INSPECT PISTON OIL CLEARANCE
44.3 mm
(a) Subtract the piston diameter measurement from the
A112242E01 cylinder bore diameter measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
0.021 to 0.044 mm (0.0008 to 0.0017 in.)
Maximum oil clearance:
0.10 mm (0.0039 in.)
If the oil clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace all the pistons. If necessary, replace the
EM
cylinder block.
5. INSPECT RING GROOVE CLEARANCE
(a) Using a feeler gauge, measure the clearance
between the new piston ring and wall of the ring
groove.
Standard ring groove clearance
Item Specified Condition
No. 1 ring 0.020 to 0.070 mm (0.0008 to 0.0028
in.)
No. 2 ring 0.020 to 0.060 mm (0.0008 to 0.0024
A126911 in.)
Oil ring 0.020 to 0.070 mm (0.0008 to 0.0028
in.)
If the groove clearance is not as specified, replace
the piston.
6. INSPECT PISTON RING END GAP
(a) Using a piston, push the piston ring a little beyond
the bottom of the ring travel, 110 mm (4.33 in.) from
the top of the cylinder block.
110 mm
Piston Ring
A098149E01
(b) Using a feeler gauge, measure the end gap.
Standard end gap
Item Specified Condition
No. 1 ring 0.24 to 0.31 mm (0.0094 to 0.0122 in.)
No. 2 ring 0.33 to 0.43 mm (0.0130 to 0.0169 in.)
Oil ring 0.10 to 0.30 mm (0.0040 to 0.0119 in.)
Maximum end gap
Item Specified Condition
EM02552E01
No. 1 ring 0.89 mm (0.0350 in.)
