ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. CHECK BATTERY CONDITION
NOTICE:
If the battery is weak or if the engine is difficult to
start, perform the following procedures.
(a) Check the battery for damage and deformation. If
severe damage, deformation or leakage is found,
replace the battery.
(b) Check the electrolyte quantity of each cell.
(1) For maintenance-free batteries:
• If the electrolyte quantity is below the lower
line, replace the battery.
• If the electrolyte quantity is above the lower
line, check the battery voltage when
cranking the engine. If the voltage is less
than 9.6 V, recharge or replace the battery.
HINT:
(cid:41) A116909 Before checking the battery voltage, turn off
all the electrical systems (headlights, blower
motor, rear defogger, etc.).
(2) For non-maintenance-free batteries:
• If the electrolyte quantity is below the lower
line, add distilled water to each cell. Then,
recharge the battery and check the
electrolyte's specific gravity.
Standard specific gravity:
1.25 to 1.29 at 20°C (68°F)
If the electrolyte quantity is above the lower
line, check the battery voltage when
(cid:41) A116907 cranking the engine. If the voltage is less
than 9.6 V, recharge or replace the battery.
HINT:
Before checking the battery voltage, turn off
all the electrical systems (headlights, blower
motor, rear defogger, etc.).
2. INSPECT BATTERY TERMINAL AND FUSE
(a) Visually check the battery terminals.
(1) Check that the battery terminals are not loose
or corroded.
(b) Measure the resistance of the H-fuses and fuses.
Standard resistance:
Below 1 Ω
If the results are not as specified, replace the fuses
as necessary.
