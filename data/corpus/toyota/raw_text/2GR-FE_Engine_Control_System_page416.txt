2 PERFORM EVAP SYSTEM CHECK (AUTO OPERATION)
NOTICE:
• The EVAP SYSTEM CHECK (AUTO OPERATION)
consists of 5 steps performed automatically by the
intelligent tester. It takes a maximum of approximately
18 minutes.
• Do not perform the EVAP SYSTEM CHECK when the
fuel tank is more than 90% full because the cut-off
valve may be closed, making the fuel tank leak check
unavailable.
• Do not run the engine during this operation.
• When the temperature of the fuel is 35°C (95°F) or
more, a large amount of vapor forms and any check
results become inaccurate. When performing the
EVAP SYSTEM CHECK, keep the temperature below
35°C (95°F).
(a) Clear the DTCs (See page ES-45).
