INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• DTC P2610 is set if an internal ECM problem is detected. Diagnostic procedures are not required.
ECM replacement is necessary.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 REPLACE ECM
