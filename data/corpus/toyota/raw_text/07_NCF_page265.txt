CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-101
8. System Operation
ABS with EBD Operation
Based on the signals received from the 4 wheel speed sensors, the skid control ECU calculates each wheel
speed and deceleration, and checks wheel slipping conditions. And according to the slipping condition, the
skid control ECU controls the pressure holding valve and pressure reduction valve in order to adjust the fluid
pressure of the each wheel cylinder in the following 3 modes: pressure reduction, pressure holding, and
pressure increase modes.

Initial Check
After the ignition is turned ON, and the vehicle attains an approximate speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) or more
only at first time, the skid control ECU performs the initial check.
The functions of each solenoid valve and pump motor in the brake actuator are checked in order.
9. CAN (Controller Area Network)
CAN communication is used between the skid control ECU, combination meter, main body ECU and DLC3.
For details of CAN communication, see page BE-8.
