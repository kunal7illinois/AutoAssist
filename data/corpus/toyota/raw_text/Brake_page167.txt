DTC C0200/31 Front Speed Sensor RH Circuit
DTC C0205/32 Front Speed Sensor LH Circuit
Low Output Signal of Front Speed Sensor RH
DTC C1271/71
(Test Mode DTC)
Low Output Signal of Front Speed Sensor LH
DTC C1272/72
(Test Mode DTC)
DESCRIPTION
The speed sensors detect wheel speed and transmit the signals to the ECU. These signals are used for
control of the ABS control system. Each of the front and rear rotors have 48 serrations.
When the rotors rotate, the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet in the speed sensor
induces an AC voltage.
BC
Since the frequency of this AC voltage changes in direct proportion to the speed of the rotor, the
frequency is used by the ECU to detect the speed of each wheel.
DTCs C1271/71 and C1272/72 can be deleted when the speed sensor sends a wheel speed signal or the
Test Mode ends. DTCs C1271/71 and C1272/72 are output only in the Test Mode.

When any of the following is detected:
1. At a vehicle speed of 6 mph (10 km/h) or more, an open
• Front speed sensor RH/LH
or short in the sensor signal circuit continues for 1 second
• Speed sensor circuit
C0200/31 or more.
• Speed sensor rotor
C0205/32 2. Momentary interruption of the sensor signal from the
• Sensor installation
abnormal wheel occurs 7 times or more.
• Brake actuator assembly (Skid control ECU)
3. An open in the speed sensor signal circuit continues for
0.5 seconds or more.
HINT:
• DTC C0200/31 is for the front speed sensor RH.
• DTC C0205/32 is for the front speed sensor LH.
