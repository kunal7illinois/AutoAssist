CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-121
TRAC Operation
(cid:3) The fluid pressure generated by the pump is regulated by the master cylinder cut solenoid valve to the required
pressure. Thus, the wheel cylinders of the drive wheels are controlled in the following 3 modes: pressure
reduction, pressure holding, and pressure increase modes, to control the slippage of the drive wheels.
(cid:3) The diagram below shows the hydraulic circuit in the pressure increase mode when the TRAC is
activated.
(cid:3) The pressure holding solenoid valve and the pressure reduction solenoid valve are turned ON/OFF
according to the ABS operation pattern described on the previous page.
(cid:3) The TRAC is activated, each solenoid operates as shown in the table on the next page.
