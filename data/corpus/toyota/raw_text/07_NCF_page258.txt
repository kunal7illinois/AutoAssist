CH-94 CHASSIS - BRAKE
2. Outline of EBD Control
General
The distribution of the brake force, which was performed mechanically in the past, is now performed under
electrical control of the skid control ECU, which precisely controls the braking force in accordance with
the vehicle’s driving conditions.
Front/Rear Wheels Brake Force Distribution
If the brakes are applied while the vehicle is moving straight forward, the transfer of the road reduces the
load that is applied to the rear wheels. The skid control ECU determines this condition by way of the signals
from the wheel speed sensors, and the brake actuator regulates the distribution of the brake force of the rear
wheels to optimally control.
For example, the amount of the brake force that is applied to the rear wheels during braking varies whether
or not the vehicle is carrying a load. The amount of the brake force that is applied to the rear wheels also
varies in accordance with the extent of the deceleration.
Thus, the distribution of the brake force to the rear is optimally controlled in order to effectively utilize the
braking force of the rear wheels under these conditions.

Right/Left Wheels Brake Force Distribution (During Cornering Braking)
When the brakes are applied while the vehicle is
cornering, the load that applied to the inner
wheel decreases and the outer wheel increases.
The skid control ECU determines this condition
by way of the signals from the wheel speed
sensors, and the brake actuator regulates the
brake force in order to optimally control the
distribution of the brake force to the inner wheel
and outer wheel.
