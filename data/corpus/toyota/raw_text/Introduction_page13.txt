IN–13
INTRODUCTION – REPAIR INSTRUCTION
(2) Work must be started at least 90 seconds after
the ignition switch is turned off and after the
cable is disconnected from the negative (-)
battery terminal.
The SRS is equipped with a back-up power
source. If work is started within 90 seconds after
IN
turning the ignition switch off and disconnecting
the cable from the negative (-) battery terminal,
the SRS may deploy.
When the cable is disconnected from the
negative (-) battery terminal, clock and audio
system memory is erased. Before starting work,
make a note of the settings of each memory
system. When work is finished, reset the clock
and audio system as before.
CAUTION:
Never use a back-up power source (battery
or other) to avoid erasing the system
memory. The back-up power source may
inadvertently power the SRS and cause it to
deploy.
(3) In minor collisions where the SRS does not
deploy, the steering pad, front passenger airbag
assembly, driver side knee airbag assembly,
front seat side airbag assembly, curtain shield
airbag assembly and front seat outer belt
assembly should be inspected before further use
of the vehicle.
(See page RS-352 for steering pad)
(See page RS-399 for front passenger airbag
assembly)
(See page RS-371 for driver side knee airbag
assembly)
(See page RS-432 for front seat side airbag
assembly)
(See page RS-426 for curtain shield airbag
assembly)
(See page SB-23 for front seat outer belt
assembly)
(4) Never use SRS parts from another vehicle.
When replacing parts, use new parts.
(5) Before repairs, remove the airbag sensor
assemblies if impacts are likely to be applied to
the sensor during repairs.

airbag sensor assemblies and all airbag
assemblies.
