DATA LIST / ACTIVE TEST
1. DATA LIST
HINT:
Using the DATA LIST using the intelligent tester allows
switch, sensor, actuator and other item values to be read
without removing any parts. Reading the DATA LIST AX
early in troubleshooting is one way to save labor time.
NOTICE:
In the table below, the values listed under "Normal
Condition" are reference values. Do not depend
solely on these reference values when deciding
whether a part is faulty.
(a) Warm up the engine.
(b) Turn the ignition switch off.
(c) Connect the intelligent tester together with the CAN
VIM (Controller Area Network Vehicle Interface
Module) to the DLC3.
(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(e) Turn the tester on.
(f) Enter the following menus: "DIAGNOSIS / OBD/
MOBD / ECT / DATA LIST".
(g) According to the display on the tester, read "DATA
LIST".
