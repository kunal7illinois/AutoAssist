system will be erased. No option exists for erasing
only one transmitter code.
(1) Press and hold the left and right switches of the
garage door opener system for 20 seconds. The
LED will begin to flash approximately 5 times per
second (5.6 Hz.) This indicates that the codes
contained in the vehicle garage door opener system
have been erased. Releasing the switches ends
clear mode.
HINT:
• If the switches are released within 10 seconds
after the transmitter codes have been erased, the
system will enter registration mode immediately
the next time a garage door opener system
switch is pressed.
• If the switches are held for 10 seconds or more
after the transmitter codes have been erased,
default codes will be set to the three switches of
the garage door opener system. These default
codes may in some cases be used for training an
opener device that uses rolling codes.
