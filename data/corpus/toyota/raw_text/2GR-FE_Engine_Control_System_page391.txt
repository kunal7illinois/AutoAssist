2. Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
3. Turn the tester on.
4. Clear the DTCs (where set).
5. Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /ENHANCED OBD II / MONITOR INFO / MONITOR
RESULT.
6. Check that RES RATE B1S1 is INCOMP.
7. Start the engine and warm it up (Procedure "A").
8. Drive the vehicle at between 25 mph and 75 mph (40 km/h and 120 km/h) for 3 minutes. However, the
vehicle should be driven at a constant speed (Procedure "B").
9. Check the monitor result values on the intelligent tester by selecting the following menu items:
DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / MONITOR INFO / TEST RESULT.
10.If the values indicated on the tester do not change, perform READINESS MONITOR DRIVE PATTERN
for the A/F sensor and the heated oxygen sensor (See page ES-338).
HINT:
Completion of all A/F sensor monitors is required to change the value in TEST RESULT.
