U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
MECHANICAL SYSTEM TESTS
1. PERFORM MECHANICAL SYSTEM TESTS
(a) Measure the stall speed.
The object of this test is to check the overall
performance of the transaxle and engine by
measuring the stall speeds in the D position. AX
NOTICE:
• Driving test should be done on a paved road
(a nonskid road).
• Perform the test at the normal operating ATF
(Automatic Transmission Fluid) temperature
50 to 80°C (122 to 176°F).
• Do not continuously run this test for longer
than 5 seconds.
• To ensure safety, perform this test in a wide,
clear level area which provides good traction.
• The stall test should always be carried out in
pairs. One technician should observe the
conditions of wheels or wheel stoppers from
a safe location outside the vehicle while the
other is doing the test.
(1) Chock the 4 wheels.
(2) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(3) Fully apply the parking brake.
(4) Keep your left foot pressed firmly on the brake
pedal.
(5) Start the engine.
(6) Using the intelligent tester, shift into the D
position and hold 3rd gear using active test.
Press all the way down on the accelerator pedal
with your right foot.
(7) Quickly read the stall speed at this time.
Stall speed:
2,520 +- 150 rpm
Evaluation:
Problem Possible cause
• Engine power output may be insufficient
• Stator one-way clutch is not operating properly
(a) Stall engine speed is low in D position HINT:
If the value is less than the specified value by 600 rpm or more, the
torque converter could be faulty.
• Line pressure is too low
• Clutch No. 1 (C ) slipping

(b) Stall engine speed is high in D position
• One-way clutch (F ) is not operating properly
