DESCRIPTION
The circuit for the side collision sensor LH (to determine deployment of the front seat side airbag
assembly LH and curtain shield airbag assembly LH) is composed of the center airbag sensor assembly,
side airbag sensor LH, and rear airbag sensor LH.
The side airbag sensor LH and rear airbag sensor LH detect impacts to the vehicle and send signals to
RS
the center airbag sensor assembly to determine if the airbag should be deployed.
DTC B1622/81, B1623/81, B1632/81, B1633/81, B1642/81, or B1643/81 is recorded when a malfunction
is detected in the circuit for the side collision sensor LH (to determine deployment of the front seat side
airbag assembly LH and curtain shield airbag assembly LH).
DTC No. DTC Detecting Condition Trouble Area
• The center airbag sensor assembly receives a line
short circuit signal, an open circuit signal, a short
1622/81 circuit to ground signal or a short circuit to B+ signal
1623/81 in the circuit for the side collision sensor LH (to • Floor wire

1643/81 • Side airbag sensor LH malfunction
• Rear airbag sensor LH malfunction
• Center airbag sensor assembly malfunction
