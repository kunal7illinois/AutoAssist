STEERING COLUMN – ELECTRIC STEERING LOCK
DTC B2788 IG2 Signal Malfunction
DESCRIPTION
The steering lock ECU receives power from the IG2 relay. When the digital signal from the certification
ECU and the voltage from the IG2 relay are received by the steering lock ECU, the steering will be
unlocked. The steering lock ECU will not lock the steering when power from the IG2 relay is present (this
prevents the steering from being locked while the vehicle is moving).
