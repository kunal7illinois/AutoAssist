INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• If any of DTCs P0115, P0117, P0118 or P0125 are set simultaneously with DTC P0116, the ECT
sensor may have an open or a short circuit. Troubleshoot those DTCs first.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK OTHER DTC OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0116)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED II
/ DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read the DTC.
