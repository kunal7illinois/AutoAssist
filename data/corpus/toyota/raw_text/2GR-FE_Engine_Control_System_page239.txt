INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data ES
can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine was
warmed up or not, whether the air/fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the time of
a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK HARNESS AND CONNECTOR (SENSOR POWER SOURCE)
