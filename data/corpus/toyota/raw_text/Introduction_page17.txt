(3) Grease or detergents of any kind should not be
applied to the knee airbag assembly.
(4) Store the knee airbag assembly where the
ambient temperature is below 93°C (200°F), the
humidity is not high and there is no electrical
noise.
(5) When using electric welding anywhere on the
vehicle, disconnect the airbag ECU connectors
(2 pins). These connectors contain shorting
springs. This feature reduces the possibility of
the airbag deploying due to current entering the
squib wiring.
(6) When disposing of a vehicle or knee airbag
assembly unit by itself, the airbag should be
inflated using SST before disposal (See page
RS-371). Activate the airbag in a safe place
away from electrical noise.

(1) Always place a removed or new front seat side
airbag assembly with the airbag inflation

squib. This may cause the airbag to inflate,
which could cause serious injury.
