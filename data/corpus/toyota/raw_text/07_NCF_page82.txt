ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-55
8. Intake Manifold Runner Valve Control (California Package Model)
General
When the engine is cold condition and idling, this control closes the intake manifold runner valve (with an
opening at the top) that is provided in the intake manifold. This creates a strong tumble airflow in the intake
air that passes through the opening, which promotes the mixture of the air and fuel and improves combustion
efficiency.
