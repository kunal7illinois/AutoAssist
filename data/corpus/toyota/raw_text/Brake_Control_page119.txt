BC–113
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
(1) Operation description
The skid control ECU detects wheelspin by
receiving signals from each speed sensor and
the ECM via CAN communication. The skid
control ECU controls engine torque with the
ECM via CAN communication and brake
hydraulic pressure through the pump and
solenoid valve.
The SLIP indicator light blinks when the system
is operating. When there is a malfunction in the
TRAC system, both VSC warning light (models
without multi information display) and SLIP
indicator light will come on and the DTC will be
displayed on the multi information display
(models with multi information display).
