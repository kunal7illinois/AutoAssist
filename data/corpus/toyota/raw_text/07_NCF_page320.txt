BODY - BODY STRUCTURE BO-5
(cid:2)SAFETY FEATURES
1. General
The impact absorbing structure of the ’07 Camry minimizes cabin deformation by effectively helping to
absorb the impact energy in the event of a front, side or rear collision. This provides high-performance
occupant protection.
2. Impact Absorbing Structure for Front Collision
An optimal arrangement of the basic frame and reinforcements helps to minimize cabin deformation in the
event of a collision.
(cid:1) The body disperses the impact force in the event of an offset frontal collision.
(cid:1) The body strengthens inner door reinforcements and reduces the gap between the door inner panel and the
pillar. This communicates impact load to the door belt line reinforcement, reducing the load on the pillar
in the event of an offset frontal collision.
(cid:1) The floor side of the front side member and the inside of the floor side member reinforcements have been
used, minimizing the cabin deformation.
