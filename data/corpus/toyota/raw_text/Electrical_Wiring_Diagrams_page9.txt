B HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
The ground points circuit diagram shows the connections from all major parts to the respective ground points. When
troubleshooting a faulty ground point, checking the system circuits which use a common ground may help you identify
the problem ground quickly. The relationship between ground points ( A1 , A2 and D4 shown below) can also be
checked this way.
