1. DESCRIPTION OF CODE REGISTRATION
HINT:
• ID codes are the same as recognition codes for the
wireless transmitter and the engine immobiliser
function. Registering an ID code enables the smart
access system with push-button start, the wireless
door lock control function and the engine immobiliser
function to be operated.
• Code registration is needed when the certification
ECU, ID code box, steering lock ECU or key is
replaced with a new one.
(a) PROCEDURE "1"
The vehicle with the smart access system with
push-button start system does not have a key slot.
