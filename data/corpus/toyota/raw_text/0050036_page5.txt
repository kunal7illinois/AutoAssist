1. Key-off monitor sequence 1 to 8
1. Atmospheric pressure measurement
Next sequence run if following condition set -
Atmospheric pressure change Less than 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g) in 1 second
2. First reference pressure measurement
Next sequence run if all of following conditions set Condition 1, 2 and 3
1. EVAP pressure just after reference pressure measurement start -1 kPa-g (-7.5 mmHg-g) or less
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.057 kPa-g (-36.4 to -7.93 mmHg-g)
3. Reference pressure Saturated within 60 seconds

Reference pressure -1.057 kPa-g (-7.93 mmHg-g) or more
Reference pressure Not saturated within 60 seconds
Reference pressure difference between first and second 0.7 kPa-g (5.25 mmHg-g) or more
