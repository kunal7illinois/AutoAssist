U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
HYDRAULIC TEST
1. PERFORM HYDRAULIC TEST
(a) Measure the line pressure.
NOTICE:
• Perform the test at the normal operating ATF
(Automatic Transmission Fluid) temperature: AX
50 to 80°C (122 to 176°F).
• The line pressure test should always be
carried out in pairs. One technician should
observe the conditions of wheels or wheel
stoppers outside the vehicle while the other
is performing the test.
• Be sure to prevent SST hose from interfering
with the exhaust pipe.
• This check must be conducted after checking
and adjusting engine.
• Perform the test with the A/C is OFF.
• When conducting stall test, do not continue
SST
more than 5 seconds.

(1) Warm up the ATF (Automatic Transmission
C133223E01
Fluid).
(2) Lift the vehicle up.
(3) Remove the engine under cover.

00271)
(6) Start the engine.
(7) Shift to the D position, and then use the
intelligent tester to hold 3rd gear using active
test. Measure the line pressure while the engine
is idling.
Specified line pressure:
Condition D position kPa (kgf/cm2, psi)
362 to 412 kPa
Idling
(3.7 to 4.2 kgf/cm2, 52 to 60 psi)
(8) Turn the ignition switch OFF.
