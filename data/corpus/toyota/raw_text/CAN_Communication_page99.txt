CAN COMMUNICATION – CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
(1) Reconnect all of the connectors to the No. 1 CAN J/
C, except for the one that was disconnected last
(the bus wire that is shorted to B+). Check that the
resistance shown on the tester is normal (6 kΩ or
more) to confirm that there is a short to B+ in one
bus wire only.
HINT:
• The connectors connected to the No. 1 CAN J/C
can be distinguished according to the color of the
communication bus wires and the shape of the
connectors.
• Reconnecting the connectors to non-specified
positions on the No. 1 CAN J/C does not affect
system operation. However, it is preferred to
reconnect the connectors to their specified
positions to avoid negative effects on the wiring
such as tension on the wiring harnesses, and to
make future maintenance easier.
OK REPLACE NO. 1 CAN J/C

4 RECONNECT CONNECTOR
(a) Reconnect the connector of the bus wire that is shorted
to B+ to the No. 1 CAN J/C (the connector that caused
the bus wire resistance to change to 6 kΩ or more when
it was disconnected).
NEXT
5 CHECK FOR SHORT TO B+ IN CAN BUS WIRE
(a) Disconnect the connector that includes terminals CANH
DLC3: E10 and CANL from the ECU (or sensor) to which the bus
CANH
wire shorted to B+ is connected. (See page CA-10)
(b) Measure the resistance according to the value(s) in the
table below.
Standard resistance
Tester Connection Condition Specified Value
BAT
E10-6 (CANH) - E10-16 (BAT) Ignition switch off 6 kΩ or higher
CANL E10-14 (CANL) - E10-16
Ignition switch off 6 kΩ or higher
C126231E12 (BAT)
HINT:
If the resistance changes to 6 kΩ or higher when the
connector is disconnected from the ECU (or sensor),
there may be a short in the ECU (or sensor).
