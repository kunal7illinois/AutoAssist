BC–142
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. DESCRIPTION
When troubleshooting a vehicle with the diagnosis
system, the only difference from the usual
troubleshooting procedure is connecting the intelligent
tester to the vehicle and reading various data output from
the vehicle's skid control ECU.
The skid control ECU records DTCs when the computer
detects a malfunction in the computer itself or in its
circuits.
To check the DTCs, connect the intelligent tester to the
DLC3 on the vehicle. The intelligent tester enables you
to erase the DTCs, activate the various actuators, and
check the Freeze Frame Data and Data List.
(a) Check the battery voltage.
Standard voltage:
11 to 14 V
BC If the voltage is below 11 V, recharge the battery
before proceeding.
(b) Check the DLC3.
DLC3: CG SG CANH SIL The ECU uses ISO 15765-4 for communication.
The terminal arrangement of the DLC3 complies
with SAE J1962 and matches the ISO 15765-4
format.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
Verify the conditions listed in the table below.

Symbols (Terminal No.) Terminal Description Condition Specified condition
SIL (7) - SG (5) Bus "+" line During transmission Pulse generation
CG (4) - Body ground Chassis ground Always Below 1 Ω
SG (5) - Body ground Signal ground Always Below 1 Ω
BAT (16) - Body ground Battery positive Always 11 to 14 V
CANH (6) - CANL (14) CAN bus line *Ignition switch off 54 to 69 Ω
CANH (6) - CG (4) HIGH-level CAN bus line *Ignition switch off 200 Ω or higher
CANL (14) - CG (4) LOW-level CAN bus line *Ignition switch off 200 Ω or higher
CANH (6) - BAT (16) HIGH-level CAN bus line *Ignition switch off 6 kΩ or higher
CANL (14) - BAT (16) LOW-level CAN bus line *Ignition switch off 6 kΩ or higher
NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the
DLC3, turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to
use the tester. If the display indicates that a
communication error has occurred, there is a
problem either with the vehicle or with the tester.
