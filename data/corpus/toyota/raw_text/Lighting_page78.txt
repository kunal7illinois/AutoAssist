LIGHTING – HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY
4. HEADLIGHT AIMING INSPECTION
(a) Cover the headlight or disconnect the connector of
the headlight on the opposite side to prevent light
from the headlight that is not being inspected from
affecting the headlight aiming inspection.
NOTICE:
Do not keep the headlight covered for more than
3 minutes. The headlight lens is made of
synthetic resin, which may melt or be damaged
due to excessive heat.
HINT:
When checking the aim of the high-beam, cover the
low-beam or disconnect the connector.
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Replacement text:
Turn on the headlight and check if the cutoff
line matches the preferred cutoff line in the
following illustration.

HINT:
• Since the low-beam light and the high-beam light
are a unit, if the aim on the low beam is correct,
the high beam should also be correct. However,
check both beams just to make sure.
