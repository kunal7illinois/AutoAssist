2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0505 Idle Control System Malfunction
DESCRIPTION
The idle speed is controlled by the Electronic Throttle Control System (ETCS). The ETCS is comprised of:
1) one valve type throttle body; 2) the throttle actuator, which operates the throttle valve; 3) the throttle
position sensor, which detects the opening angle of the throttle valve; 4) the accelerator pedal position
sensor, which detects the accelerator pedal position; 5) the ECM, which controls the ETCS. Based on the
target idle speed, the ECM controls the throttle actuator to provide the proper throttle valve opening angle.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
• ETCS
Idle speed continues to vary greatly from target speed • Air induction system

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM monitors the idling speed and idling air flow volume to conduct Idle Speed Control (ISC). The
ECM determines that the ISC system is malfunctioning if the following conditions are met:
• The learned idling air flow volume remains at the maximum or minimum 5 times or more during a
driving cycle
• While driving at 6 mph (10 km/h) or more, the actual engine idling speed varies from the target idling
speed by between 100 rpm and 200 rpm, 5 times or more during a driving cycle.
Example:
If the actual idling speed varies from the target idling speed by more than 200 rpm* 5 times during a
driving cycle, the ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
HINT:
*: Threshold idling speed varies with engine load.
