FAIL-SAFE
When this DTC, or other DTCs relating to ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System) malfunctions, are
set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe mode, the ECM cuts the current to the throttle
actuator off, and the throttle valve is returned to a 6° throttle angle by the return spring. The ECM then
adjusts the engine output by controlling the fuel injection (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition timing, in
accordance with the accelerator pedal opening angle, to allow the vehicle to continue at a minimal speed.
If the accelerator pedal is depressed firmly and gently, the vehicle can be driven slowly.
Fail-safe mode continues until a pass condition is detected, and the ignition switch is then turned OFF.
