ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-127
7. ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System)
General
The ACIS is realized by using a bulkhead to divide the intake manifold into 2 stages, with an intake air
control valve in the bulkhead being opened and closed to vary the effective length of the intake manifold
in accordance with the engine speed and throttle valve opening angle. This increases the power output in
all ranges from low to high speed.

Construction
1) Intake Air Control Valve
The intake air control valve, which is Intake Air
provided in the intake air chamber, open Control Valve
and close to change the effective length of
the intake manifold in 2 stages.
2) Actuator (Motor)
The actuator activates the intake air control
valve based on signals from the ECM.
