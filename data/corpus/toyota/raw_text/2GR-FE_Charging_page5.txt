ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. CHECK BATTERY ELECTROLYTE LEVEL
(a) Check the electrolyte level.
(1) If the electrolyte level is low, replace the battery
(or add distilled water) and check the charging
system.
2. CHECK BATTERY SPECIFIC GRAVITY
(a) Check the color of the indicator.
Green Dark Clear or Light Yellow Result
Indicator color Condition
Green Good
Dark Charging necessary
Clear or light yellow Replacement necessary
3. CHECK BATTERY VOLTAGE
A115815E01 (a) If it has not been 20 minutes since you drove the
vehicle or since the engine was stopped, turn the
ignition switch on (IG) and turn on the electrical
systems (headlight, blower motor, rear defogger,
etc.) for 60 seconds. This will remove the surface
charge from the battery.
(b) Turn off the ignition switch and the electrical
systems.
(c) Measure the battery voltage between the negative (-
) and positive (+) terminals of the battery.
Standard voltage:
12.5 to 12.9 V at 20°C (68°F)
HINT:
If the voltage is below the specification, charge the
battery.
4. CHECK BATTERY TERMINAL
(a) Check that the battery terminals are not loose or
A081052E01 corroded.
If the terminals are corroded, clean them.
5. CHECK FUSES
(a) Measure the resistance of the ALT fuse, ALT-S fuse,
GAUGE No. 1 fuse and GAUGE No. 2 fuse.
Standard resistance:
Below 1 Ω
If the result is not as specified, replace the fuses as
necessary.
6. CHECK V-RIBBED BELT
(a) Check the belt for wear, cracks or other signs of
damage.
If any of the following defects is found, replace the
V-ribbed belt.
• The belt is worn out, cracked, or the cords are
CH
exposed.
• The cracks reach the cords in more than one
place.
• The belt has chunks missing from the ribs.
