5. Counter Drive Gear
(cid:1) Angular ball bearings are used to support the counter drive gear and the Ravigneaux planetary gear unit,
reducing the rolling resistance and noise.
(cid:1) By providing three elongated openings in the counter drive gear, the vibration conduction characteristic
of the gear has been optimized. As a result, both gear noise and weight reductions have been achieved.

6. Clutch and Brake Pistons
(cid:1) Two types of pistons are used; a non-split piston that acts in the push direction for the No.1 clutch (C1)
operation, and a split piston that acts in the pull direction for the No.2 clutch (C2) operation. These two
types of pistons contribute to making the entire clutch structure compact.
(cid:1) When the split piston operates, clutch drag occurs due to rattling cause by the divided portion of the piston.
However, by fitting springs on the piston circumference, such rattling is restrained and the occurrence of
clutch drag is minimized.
(cid:1) By setting the piston for the No.3 brake (B3) operation around the counter drive gear, the brake structure
has been made more compact.
