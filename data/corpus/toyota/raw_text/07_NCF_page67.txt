EG-40 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
Mass Air Flow Meter
(cid:1) This mass air flow meter, which is a plug-in type, allows a portion of the intake air to flow through the
detection area. By directly measuring the mass and the flow rate of the intake air, the detection precision
is improved and the intake air resistance is reduced.
(cid:1) This mass air flow meter has a built-in intake air temperature sensor.

Crankshaft Position Sensor
The timing rotor of the crankshaft consists of 34 teeth, with 2 teeth missing. The crankshaft position sensor
outputs the crankshaft rotation signals every 10(cid:2), and the missing teeth are used to determine the
top-dead-center.
