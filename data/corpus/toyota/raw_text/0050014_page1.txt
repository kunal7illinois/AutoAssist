DESCRIPTION
The VVT system includes the ECM, Oil Control Valve (OCV) and VVT controller. The ECM sends a target
duty-cycle control signal to the OCV. This control signal regulates the oil pressure supplied to the VVT
controller. Camshaft timing control is performed according to engine operating conditions such as the
intake air volume, throttle valve position and engine coolant temperature. The ECM controls the OCV,
ES
based on the signals transmitted by several sensors. The VVT controller regulates the intake camshaft
angle using oil pressure through the OCV. As a result, the relative positions of the camshaft and
crankshaft are optimized, the engine torque and fuel economy improve, and the exhaust emissions
decrease under overall driving conditions. The ECM detects the actual intake valve timing using signals
from the camshaft and crankshaft position sensors, and performs feedback control. This is how the target
intake valve timing is verified by the ECM.
