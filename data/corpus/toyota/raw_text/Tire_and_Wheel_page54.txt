DTC C2167/67 Abnormal Temperature Inside ID3 Tire
DTC C2168/68 Abnormal Temperature Inside ID4 Tire

DESCRIPTION
Each tire pressure warning valve and transmitter measures the internal temperature of its tire as well as
tire pressure, and transmits the information to the tire pressure warning ECU along with the transmitter ID.
If the measured temperature is out of the specified range, the tire pressure warning ECU recognizes it as TW
a malfunction, outputs DTCs, and blinks the tire pressure warning light.
DTC No. DTC Detecting Condition Trouble Area

HINT:
• It is necessary to perform the procedure to identify the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter that
is malfunctioning because it cannot be identified by the output DTC.
• DTC 2169/69 is used only when the vehicle is equipped with ground spare tire.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
NOTICE:
• When replacing the tire pressure warning ECU, read the IDs stored in the ECU using the
intelligent tester and note them down before removal.
• It is necessary to perform initialization (See page TW-18) after registration (See page TW-15) of
the transmitter IDs into the tire pressure warning ECU after the ECU and/or valve and
transmitter has been replaced.
HINT:
Set the tire pressure to the specified value.
1 CHECK TIRES
