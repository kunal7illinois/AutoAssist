Open or Short in Heated Oxygen (HO2) Sensor Circuit (DTC P0137 or P0138)
During active air-fuel ratio control, the ECM calculates the Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC)* of the Three-
Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) by forcibly regulating the air-fuel ratio to become rich or lean. If the HO2
sensor has an open or short, or the voltage output of the sensor decreases significantly, the OSC
indicates an extraordinarily high value. Even if the ECM attempts to continue regulating the air-fuel ratio to
become rich or lean, the HO2 sensor output does not change.
While performing active air-fuel ratio control, when the target air-fuel ratio is rich and the HO2 sensor
voltage output is 0.21 V or less (lean), the ECM interprets this as an abnormally low sensor output voltage
and sets DTC P0137. When the target air-fuel ratio is lean and the voltage output is 0.59 V or more (rich)
during active air-fuel ratio control, the ECM determines that the sensor voltage output is abnormally high,
and sets DTC P0138.
HINT:
DTC P0138 is also set if the HO2 sensor voltage output is more than 1.2 V for 10 seconds or more.
*: The TWC has the capability to store oxygen. The OSC and the emission purification capacity of the
TWC are mutually related. The ECM determines whether the catalyst has deteriorated based on the
calculated OSC value (see page ES-191).
