CH-10 CHASSIS - U250E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
(cid:2)PLANETARY GEAR UNIT
1. Construction
(cid:1) The U250E automatic transaxle uses the gear layout in which the front and rear planetary gear units are
placed on the input shaft (intermediate shaft), the counter drive and driven gears are placed on the front
of the front planetary gear unit, and the U/D planetary gear unit is placed on the counter shaft.
(cid:1) A centrifugal fluid pressure canceling mechanism is used in the C , C , C , and C clutches that are applied
0 2 3 1
when shifting from 2nd to 3rd, from 3rd to 4th and from 4th to 5th. For detail, refer to Centrifugal Fluid
Pressure Canceling Mechanism on page CH-16.
