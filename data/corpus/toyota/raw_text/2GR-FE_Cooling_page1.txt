ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. CHECK FOR ENGINE COOLANT LEAKS
CAUTION:
Do not remove the radiator cap while the engine and
radiator are still hot. Pressurized, hot engine coolant
and steam may be released and cause serious
burns.
NOTICE:
Before performing each inspection, turn the A/C
switch OFF.
(a) Fill the radiator with coolant and attach a radiator
cap tester.
(b) Warm up the engine.
(c) Using a radiator cap tester, increase the pressure
inside the radiator to 118 kPa (1.2 kgf*cm, 17 psi),
and check that the pressure does not drop.
If the pressure drops, check the hoses, radiator and
water pump for leaks. If no external leaks are found,
check the heater core, cylinder block and cylinder
head.

2. INSPECT ENGINE COOLANT LEVEL IN RESERVOIR
(a) Check that the engine coolant level is between the
LOW and FULL lines when the engine is cold.
If the engine coolant level is low, check for leaks and
add "TOYOTA Super Long Life Coolant" or similar
high quality ethylene glycol based non-silicate, non-
amine, non-nitrite and non-borate coolant with long-
life hybrid organic acid technology to the FULL line.
NOTICE:
Do not substitute plain water for engine coolant.
3. INSPECT ENGINE COOLANT QUALITY
(a) Remove the radiator cap. CO
CAUTION:
Do not remove the radiator cap while the engine
and radiator are still hot. Pressurized, hot
engine coolant and steam may be released and
cause serious burns.
(b) Check if there are any excessive deposits of rust or
scales around the radiator cap and radiator filler
hole. Also, the coolant should be free of oil.
If excessively dirty, clean the coolant passage and
replace the coolant.
(c) Install the radiator cap.
