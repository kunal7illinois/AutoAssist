HINT:
• *1: If no idling conditions are specified, the transmission
gear selector lever should be in the N or P position, and
the A/C switch and all accessory switches should be OFF.
• *2: DATA LIST values are only displayed when performing
the following ACTIVE TEST: VVT B1. For other ACTIVE
TESTs, the DATA LIST value will be 0.
2. ACTIVE TEST
HINT:
Performing an ACTIVE TEST enables components
including the relays, VSV (Vacuum Switching Valve) and
actuators, to be operated without removing any parts.
The ACTIVE TEST can be performed with the intelligent
tester. Performing the ACTIVE TEST as the first step of
troubleshooting is one method of shortening diagnostic
time.
DATA LIST can be displayed during ACTIVE TEST.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
