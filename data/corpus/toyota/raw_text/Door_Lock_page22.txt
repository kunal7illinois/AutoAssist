DOOR LOCK – POWER DOOR LOCK CONTROL SYSTEM
Driver Side Door UNLOCK Detection Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The driver's door unlock detection switch is built into the driver's door lock assembly. The switch turns on
when the driver's door is locked and turns off when the door is unlocked.
The main body ECU is connected to the driver's door lock assembly via terminal LSWD and driver's door
lock/unlock state signals are input to the main body ECU.
The main body ECU applies voltage to the door unlock detection switch via terminal LSWD. When the
door unlock detection switch is on (there is continuity between the switch terminals), a lock state signal is
input to the main body ECU. When the switch is off (there is no continuity between the switch terminals),
an unlock state signal is input.
