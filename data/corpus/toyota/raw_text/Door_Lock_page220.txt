DOOR LOCK – KEY REMINDER WARNING SYSTEM
DATA LIST / ACTIVE TEST
1. READ DATA LIST
HINT:
Using the intelligent tester to read the DATA LIST allows
the values or states of switches, sensors, actuators and
other items to be read without removing any parts. This
non intrusive inspection can be very useful as
intermittent conditions or signals may be discovered
before parts or wiring is disturbed. Reading the DATA
LIST information early in troubleshooting is one way to
save diagnostic time.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the Controller Area
Network Vehicle Interface Module (CAN VIM). Then
connect the CAN VIM to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch to the ON position.
(c) Read the DATA LIST.
