STEERING COLUMN – ELECTRIC STEERING LOCK
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. DESCRIPTION
(a) DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM
When troubleshooting a vehicle with a diagnostic
system, the only difference from the usual
troubleshooting procedure is connecting the
intelligent tester to the vehicle and reading various
data output from the vehicle's steering lock ECU.
The steering lock ECU records DTCs when the
computer detects a malfunction in the computer
itself or in system circuits.
To check the DTCs, connect the intelligent tester to
the DLC3 on the vehicle. The intelligent tester
enables the DTCs to be cleared, the indicators to be
activated, and the DATA LIST to be checked.
(b) The steering lock ECU diagnosis information cannot
be read directly from the steering lock ECU by the
tester. The diagnosis information from the steering
lock ECU is transmitted to the tester via the
certification ECU to the tester using the controller
area network (CAN).
2. CHECK DLC3
(a) The certification ECU uses ISO 15765-4 for SR
CG SG CANH SIL communication. The terminal arrangement of the
DLC3 complies with SAE J1962 and matches the
ISO 15765-4 format.

NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the engine switch, and other switches
or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
