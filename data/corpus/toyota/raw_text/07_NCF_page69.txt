EG-42 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor
1) TMC Made Model
This no-contact type accelerator pedal position sensor uses a Hall IC, which is mounted on the accelerator
pedal arm.
(cid:1) The magnetic yoke is mounted at the base of the accelerator pedal arm. This yoke rotates around the
Hall IC in accordance with the amount of effort that is applied to the accelerator pedal. The Hall IC
converts the changes in the magnetic flux that occur into electrical signals, and outputs them in the
form of accelerator pedal position signals to the ECM.
(cid:1) The Hall IC contains two circuits, one for the main signal, and one for the sub signal. It converts the
accelerator pedal position (angle) into electric signals that have differing characteristics and outputs
them to the ECM.

Service Tip
The inspection method differs from a conventional accelerator pedal position sensor because this
sensor uses a Hall IC. For details, refer to the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
