HINT:
• DTCs P2195 and P2196 indicate malfunctions related to the bank 1 A/F sensor circuit.
• DTCs P2197 and P2198 indicate malfunctions related to the bank 2 A/F sensor circuit.
• Bank 1 refers to the bank that includes cylinder No. 1.
• Bank 2 refers to the bank that includes cylinder No. 2.
• When any of these DTCs are set, check the A/F sensor output voltage by entering the following menus
on the intelligent tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / AFS B1S1.
• Short-term fuel trim values can also be read using an intelligent tester.
• The ECM regulates the voltages at the A1A+, A2A+, A1A- and A2A- terminals of the ECM to a
constant level. Therefore, the A/F sensor output voltage cannot be confirmed without using the
intelligent tester.
