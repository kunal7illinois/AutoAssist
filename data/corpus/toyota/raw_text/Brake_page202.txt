BC–196
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
• When the speed sensor or the yaw rate sensor has trouble, DTCs for the steering angle sensor may be
output even when the steering angle sensor is normal. When DTCs for the speed sensor or yaw rate
sensor are output together with other DTCs for the steering angle sensor, inspect and repair the speed
sensor and yaw rate sensor first, and then inspect and repair the steering angle sensor.
1 CHECK DTC
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-141).
(b) Turn the ignition switch off.
(c) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) again and check that no
CAN communication system DTC is output.
(d) Drive the vehicle and turn the steering wheel to the right
and left at the speed of 22 mph (35 km/h) and check that
no speed sensor and yaw rate sensor DTCs are output.

HINT:
• If there is a malfunction in the speed sensor or the
yaw rate sensor, an abnormal value may be output
although the steering angle sensor is normal.
• If the speed sensor and the yaw rate sensor DTCs are
output simultaneously, repair the sensors and inspect
the steering angle sensor.
