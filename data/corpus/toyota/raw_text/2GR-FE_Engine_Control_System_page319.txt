DTC P0705
tion (PRNDL Input)
DESCRIPTION
The park / neutral position switch detects the shift lever position and sends signals to the ECM.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area

simultaneously (2-trip detection logic)
• P input signal is ON.
• N input signal is ON.
• R input signal is ON.
• D input signal is ON.
(B) Any 2 or more signals of the following are ON
simultaneously (2-trip detection logic)
• NSW input signal is ON. • Short in park / neutral position switch circuit
ES
P0705 • R input signal is ON. • Park / neutral position switch
• D input signal is ON. • ECM
(C) Any of following conditions is met for 2.0 sec. or
more in the S position (2-trip detection logic).
• NSW input signal is ON.
• P input signal is ON.
• N input signal is ON.
• R input signal is ON.
(D) All switches are OFF simultaneously for NSW, P, R,
N and D.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
These DTCs indicate a problem with the park / neutral position switch and the wire harness in the park /
neutral position switch circuit.
The park / neutral position switch detects the shift lever position and sends a signal to the ECM.
For security, the park / neutral position switch detects the shift lever position so that engine can be started
only when the shift lever is in the P or N position.
The park / neutral position switch sends a signal to the ECM according to the shift position (P, R, N or D).
The ECM determines that there is a problem with the switch or related parts if it receives more than 1
position signal simultaneously. The ECM will turn on the MIL and store the DTC.
