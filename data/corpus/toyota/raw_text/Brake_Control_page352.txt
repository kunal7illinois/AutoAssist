BC–341
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
Open or Short Circuit in ABS Solenoid Relay
DTC C0278/11
Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The ABS solenoid relay supplies power to the ABS solenoid.
The solenoid relay is turned on 1.5 seconds after the ignition switch is turned on (IG), and is turned off if
an open or short in the solenoid is detected by self diagnosis performed when the vehicle starts running.
The ABS solenoid relay is housed in the skid control ECU in the brake actuator assembly.
HINT:
If a speed signal of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more is input to the skid control ECU, with the ignition switch on (IG)
and the stop light switch off, the skid control ECU performs self diagnosis of the motor and solenoid
circuits.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When any of the following is detected:
• When the relay is ON, the voltage is less than IG
• ABS No. 2 fuse (Fusible link)
terminal voltage x 0.8 V for 0.5 seconds.
C0278/11 • Brake actuator assembly (skid control ECU)
• When the relay is OFF, the voltage is out of range
(IG terminal voltage x 0.1 to IG terminal voltage x • Solenoid relay circuit BC
0.8).
