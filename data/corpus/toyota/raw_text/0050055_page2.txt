HINT:
• When either of these DTCs is set, check the A/F sensor output voltage by selecting the following menu
items on the intelligent tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / AFS B1
S1.
• Short-term fuel trim values can also be read using the intelligent tester.
• The ECM regulates the voltages at the A1A+ and A1A- terminals of the ECM to a constant level.
Therefore, the A/F sensor output voltage cannot be confirmed without using the intelligent tester.
• If the A/F sensor is malfunctioning, the ECM sets the DTC P2195 or P2196.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
Sensor voltage detection monitor
Under the air-fuel ratio feedback control, if the A/F sensor output voltage indicates rich or lean for a certain
period of time, the ECM determines that there is a malfunction in the A/F sensor. The ECM illuminates the
MIL and sets a DTC.
Example:
If the A/F sensor output voltage is less than 2.8 V (very rich condition) for 10 seconds, despite the rear
HO2 sensor output voltage being less than 0.6 V, the ECM sets DTC P2196. Alternatively, if the A/F
sensor output voltage is more than 3.8 V (very lean condition) for 10 seconds, despite the rear HO2
sensor output voltage being 0.15 V or more, DTC P2195 is set.
Sensor current detection monitor
A rich air-fuel mixture causes a low A/F sensor current, and a lean air-fuel mixture causes a high A/F
sensor current. Therefore, the sensor output becomes low during acceleration, and it becomes high
during deceleration with the throttle valve fully closed. The ECM monitors the A/F sensor current during
fuel-cut and detects any abnormal current values.
If the A/F sensor output is 3.6 mA or more for more than 3 seconds of cumulative time, the ECM interprets
this as a malfunction in the A/F sensor and sets DTC P2195 (high-side stuck). If the A/F sensor output is
less than 1.0 mA for more than 3 seconds of cumulative time, the ECM sets DTC P2196 (low-side stuck).
