DESCRIPTION
The skid control ECU receives signals from the yaw rate and acceleration sensor via the CAN
communication system.
The yaw rate sensor has a built in acceleration sensor and detects the vehicle's condition using 2 circuits
(GL1, GL2).
If there is trouble in the bus lines between the yaw rate and acceleration sensor and the CAN
communication system, the DTC U0123/62 (malfunction in CAN communication with the yaw rate sensor)
and U0124/95 (malfunction in CAN communication with the acceleration sensor) are output.
These DTCs are also output when calibration has not been completed.
DTCs C0371/71 and C1279/79 can be deleted when the yaw rate and acceleration sensor sends a yaw
rate and/or acceleration signal or the Test Mode ends. DTCs C0371/71 and C1279/79 are output only in
the Test Mode.
