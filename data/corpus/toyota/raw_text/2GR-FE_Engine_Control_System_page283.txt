2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Sequence Operation Description Duration
In order to determine 0.02 inch leak pressure standard,
First 0.02 inch leak pressure vacuum pump creates negative pressure (vacuum)
B 60 seconds
measurement through 0.02 inch orifice and then ECM checks if
vacuum pump and vent valve operate normally.
Vent valve turned ON (closed) to shut EVAP system.
Negative pressure (vacuum) created in EVAP system,
and EVAP system pressure then measured.
EVAP system pressure

check.
If EVAP pressure does not stabilize within 15 minutes,
ECM cancels EVAP system monitor.
EVAP VSV opened and then EVAP system pressure
D EVAP VSV monitor measured by ECM. 10 seconds
Large increase indicates normal.
After second 0.02 inch leak pressure measurement,
leak check performed by comparing first and second
ES
Second 0.02 inch leak pressure 0.02 inch leak pressure standards.
E 60 seconds
measurement If stabilized system pressure higher than second 0.02
inch leak pressure standard, ECM determines that
EVAP system leaking.
Atmospheric pressure measured and then monitoring
F Final check -
result recorded by ECM.
HINT:
*: If only a small amount of fuel is in the fuel tank, it takes longer for the EVAP pressure to stabilize.

1. P0455: EVAP (Evaporative Emission ) gross leak
In operation C, the vacuum pump creates negative pressure (vacuum) in the EVAP system and the
EVAP system pressure is measured. If the stabilized system pressure is higher than [second 0.02 inch
leak pressure standard x 0.2] (near atmospheric pressure), the ECM determines that the EVAP system
has a large leak, illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
