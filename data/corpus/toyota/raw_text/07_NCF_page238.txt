CH-74 CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
Operation
(cid:3) The driver selects the S mode position by engaging the shift lever. At this time, the shift range position
selects the 4th or 5th range according to the vehicle speed. (During AI-Shift control, the shift range that
has the currently controlled gear position as the maximum usable gear position is displayed.) Then, the
shift range positions change one at a time, as the driver moves the shift lever to the front (“+” position)
or to the rear (“-” position).
(cid:3) Under this control, the ECT ECU effects optimal shift control within the usable gear range that the driver
has selected. As with an ordinary automatic transmission, it shifts to the 1st gear when the vehicle is
stopped.
(cid:3) When the shift lever is in the S mode position, the S mode indicator light in the combination meter
illuminates. The shift range indicator light indicates the state of the shift range position that the driver
has selected.
