AC–121
AIR CONDITIONING – REFRIGERANT
(a) Read the manifold gauge pressure when the
following conditions are established.
Test conditions:
• Temperature at the air inlet with the switch set at
RECIRC is 30 to 35°C (86 to 95°F)
• Engine is running at 1,500 rpm
• Blower speed control switch is at "HI"
• Temperature control dial is at "COOL"
• A/C switch is ON
• Doors are fully open
• Ignition switch is in a position that enables the
AC compressor to run.
