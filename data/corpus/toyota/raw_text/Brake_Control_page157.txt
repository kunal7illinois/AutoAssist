BC–151
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
FAIL-SAFE CHART
1. FAIL SAFE OPERATION
• If there is a problem with sensor signals or actuator
systems, the skid control ECU prohibits power supply
to the brake actuator assembly and informs the ECM
of VSC system failure.
The brake actuator assembly turns off each solenoid
and the ECM shuts off VSC control (traction control
signal) from the skid control ECU accordingly, which
turns out to be as if the ABS, TRAC and VSC systems
were not installed.
The ABS control will be prohibited, but EBD control
continues as much as possible. If EBD control is
impossible, the BRAKE warning light comes on to
warn the driver (See page BC-138).
• If system components have any malfunction before
starting control, immediately stop the operation. If
system components have any malfunction during BC
control, gradually stop the control so as not to trigger
a sudden change in vehicle conditions.
If it is impossible to control the systems, the warning
light comes on to inform the driver of termination of
the systems (See page BC-138).
HINT:
If the hydraulic brake booster encounters a malfunction,
brake performance is gradually lost and ABS, BA, TRAC
and VSC systems are prohibited.
ABS, EBD and BA system:
Malfunction Area Control Method
ABS system ABS, BA, TRAC and VSC control prohibited
BA system ABS, BA, TRAC and VSC control prohibited
EBD system ABS, EBD, BA, TRAC and VSC control prohibited
HINT:
A malfunction in either the ABS or BA system will result
in an identical operation, with ABS, BA, TRAC and VSC
system control prohibited.
TRAC and VSC system:
Malfunction Area Control Method
Engine control system Before control: Disables control
(TRAC and VSC systems) During control: Uses only the brakes to effect control
Brake control system Before control: Disables control
(VSC system) During control: Uses only the engine to effect control
Brake control system Before control: Disables control
(TRAC system) During control: Disables control (by gradually ending control)
HINT:
As for the TRAC and VSC systems, different systems
prohibit different controls depending on a malfunctioning
part.
