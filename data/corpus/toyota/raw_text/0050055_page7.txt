ES–305
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
The following instructions describe how to conduct the A/F CONTROL operation using the intelligent
tester.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine and turn the tester ON.
(c) Warm up the engine at an engine speed of 2,500 rpm for approximately 90 seconds.
(d) On the tester, select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST / A/
F CONTROL.
(e) Perform the A/F CONTROL operation with the engine idling (press the RIGHT or LEFT button to
change the fuel injection volume).
(f) Monitor the output voltages of the A/F and HO2 sensors (AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2) displayed on the
tester.
HINT:
• The A/F CONTROL operation lowers the fuel injection volume by 12.5 % or increases the injection
ES
volume by 25 %.
• The sensors react in accordance with increases and decreases in the fuel injection volume.

NOTICE:
The A/F sensor has an output delay of a few seconds and the HO2 sensor (sensor 2) output has a
maximum output delay of approximately of 20 seconds.
