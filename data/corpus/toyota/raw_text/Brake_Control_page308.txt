BC–297
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
PROBLEM SYMPTOMS TABLE
If there are no DTCs output but the problem still occurs,
check the circuits for each problem symptom in the order
given in the table below, and proceed to the relevant
troubleshooting page.
NOTICE:
Before replacing the brake actuator assembly, sensor, or
other related parts, turn the ignition switch off.

Symptom Suspected area See page
1. Check for the DTC again and make sure that the normal BC-302
system code is output.
2. IG power source circuit BC-361
3. Front speed sensor circuit BC-316
4. Rear speed sensor circuit BC-324
5. Check the brake actuator assembly with the intelligent tester BC-431
ABS, BA and/or EBD does not operate
(Check brake actuator assembly operation using the active
test function). If abnormal, check the hydraulic circuit for
BC
leakage.
6. If the symptoms still occur even after the above circuits in BC-432
suspected areas have been inspected and proved to be
normal, replace the brake actuator assembly (skid control
ECU).
1. Check for the DTC again and make sure that the normal BC-302
system code is output.
2. Front speed sensor circuit BC-316
3. Rear speed sensor circuit BC-324
4. Stop light switch circuit BC-368
5. Check the brake actuator assembly with the intelligent tester BC-431
ABS, BA and/or EBD does not operate efficiently
(Check brake actuator assembly operation using the active
test function). If abnormal, check the hydraulic circuit for
leakage.
6. If the symptoms still occur even after the above circuits in BC-432
suspected areas have been inspected and proved to be
normal, replace the brake actuator assembly (skid control
ECU).
1. Check for the DTC again and make sure that the normal BC-302
system code is output.
2. IG power source circuit BC-361
3. Check the hydraulic circuit for leakage. -
4. Front speed sensor circuit BC-316
VSC and/or TRACTION does not operate 5. Rear speed sensor circuit BC-324
6. Yaw rate and deceleration sensor circuit BC-343
7. Steering angle sensor circuit BC-350
8. If the symptoms still occur even after the above circuits in BC-432
suspected areas have been inspected and proved to be
normal, replace the brake actuator assembly (skid control
ECU).
1. Check for the DTC again and make sure that the normal BC-302
system code is output.
2. TC and CG terminal circuit BC-418
ABS sensor DTC check cannot be done
3. If the symptoms still occur even after the above circuits in BC-432
suspected areas have been inspected and proved to be
normal, replace the brake actuator assembly (skid control
ECU).
