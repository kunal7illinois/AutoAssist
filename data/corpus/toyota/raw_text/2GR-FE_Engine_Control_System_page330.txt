INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• Read freeze frame data using an intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
• The throttle actuator current (THROTTLE MOT) and the throttle actuator duty ratio (THROTTLE OPN /
THROTTLE CLS) can be read using the intelligent tester. However, the ECM shuts off the throttle
actuator current when the ETCS malfunctions.
1 INSPECT THROTTLE BODY (RESISTANCE OF THROTTLE CONTROL MOTOR)
(a) Disconnect the C5 throttle body connector.
