6 CHECK HARNESS AND CONNECTOR (C/OPN RELAY - FUEL PUMP - BODY GROUND)
(a) Check the harness and the connectors between the
Wire Harness Side:
instrument panel junction block assembly and the fuel
pump.
Main Body ECU (1) Disconnect the IA instrument panel junction block
connector.

7 INSPECT FUEL PUMP
(a) Inspect fuel pump resistance.
Component Side:
(1) Measure the resistance between the terminals.
Front View Standard resistance:
Fuel Pump
0.2 to 3.0 Ω at 20°C(68°F)
(b) Inspect fuel pump operation.
(1) Apply the battery voltage to both the terminals.
Check that the pump operates.
NOTICE:
• These tests must be done quickly (within 10
seconds) to prevent the coil from burning

out.
• Keep the fuel pump as far away from the
battery as possible.
