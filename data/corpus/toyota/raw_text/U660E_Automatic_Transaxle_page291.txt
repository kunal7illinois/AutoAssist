17. INSPECT CLEARANCE OF NO. 3 BRAKE
Front Oil Pump
Dimension A (a) Using vernier calipers and a straight edge, measure
Assembly
the distance shown in the illustration (Dimension A)
while a load of 500 N (51 kgf, 112 lbf) is being
applied to the flange.
HINT:
AX
Measure dimension A at 3 points where the flange
diameter is approximately 166 mm (6.54 in.) and
calculate the average.
(b) Using vernier calipers and a straight edge, measure
the distance shown in the illustration. (Dimension
B).
HINT:
Dimension B Measure dimension B at 3 points where the No. 3
No. 3 Brake
brake diameter is approximately 166 mm (6.54 in.)
and calculate the average.
(c) Calculate the clearance value using the following
formula:
Contact Surface of Front
clearance = Dimension B - Dimension A
Oil Pump Assembly
Standard clearance:
0.599 to 0.761 mm (0.0236 to 0.0300 in.)
C138724E01
If the clearance is not as specified, select an
appropriate brake flange so that the clearance will
be within the specified range.
HINT:
There are 6 different thicknesses of flanges
available.
No. 3 brake flange thickness: mm (in.)

18. INSPECT CLEARANCE OF NO. 1 CLUTCH DISC
(a) Install the direct multiple disc clutch assembly onto
the transaxle rear cover.
(b) Using a dial indicator, measure the No. 1 clutch
pack clearance while applying and releasing
compressed air (200 kPa, 2.0 kgf/cm2, 29 psi).
HINT:
Measure the clearance at 3 points where the flange
diameter is approximately 152 mm (5.98 in.) and
calculate the average.
Pack clearance:
0.806 to 0.974 mm (0.0317 to 0.0383 in.)
If the pack clearance is not as specified, inspect the
discs, plates and flange.
HINT:
There are 6 different thicknesses of flanges
available.
No. 1 clutch flange thickness: mm (in.)
