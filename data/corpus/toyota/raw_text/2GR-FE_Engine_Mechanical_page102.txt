26. INSPECT VALVE GUIDE BUSH OIL CLEARANCE
(a) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inside diameter
of the guide bush.
Bush inside diameter:
5.510 to 5.530 mm (0.2169 to 0.2177 in.)
(b) Subtract the valve stem diameter measurement
from the guide bush inside diameter measurement.
Standard clearance
Item Clearance
A120707 Intake 0.025 to 0.060 mm (0.0010 to 0.0024 in.)
Exhaust 0.030 to 0.065 mm (0.0012 to 0.0026 in.)
Maximum oil clearance
Item Clearance
Intake 0.08 mm (0.0032 in.)
Exhaust 0.10 mm (0.0039 in.)
For intake side:
EM
If the clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the intake valve and intake guide bush.
For exhaust side:
If the clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the exhaust valve and exhaust guide bush.
27. INSPECT CAMSHAFT THRUST CLEARANCE
(a) Inspect the RH bank camshaft thrust clearance.
(1) Install the RH bank camshafts (See page EM-
113).
(2) Using a dial indicator, measure the thrust
clearance while moving the camshaft back and
forth.
Standard thrust clearance:
0.08 to 0.13 mm (0.0031 to 0.0051 in.)
Maximum thrust clearance:
0.15 mm (0.006 in.)
If the thrust clearance is greater than the
maximum, replace the cylinder head. If the
thrust surface is damaged, replace the
A109682
camshaft.
(b) Inspect the LH bank camshaft thrust clearance.
(1) Install the LH bank camshafts (See page EM-
113).
(2) Using a dial indicator, measure the thrust
clearance while moving the camshaft back and
forth.
Standard thrust clearance:
0.08 to 0.13 mm (0.0031 to 0.0051 in.)
Maximum thrust clearance:
0.15 mm (0.006 in.)
If the thrust clearance is greater than the
maximum, replace the cylinder head. If the
thrust surface is damaged, replace the
camshaft.
