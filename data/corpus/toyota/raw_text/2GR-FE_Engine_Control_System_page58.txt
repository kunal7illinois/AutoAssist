DATA LIST / ACTIVE TEST
1. DATA LIST
HINT:
By reading the DATA LIST displayed on an intelligent
tester, you can check values, including those of the
switches, sensors, and actuators, without removing any
parts. Reading the DATA LIST as the first step in
troubleshooting is one method of shortening diagnostic
time.
NOTICE:
In the table below, the values listed under Normal
Condition are reference only. Do not depend solely
on these values when determining whether or not a
part is faulty.
ES
(a) Warm up the engine.
(b) Turn the ignition switch off.
(c) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(e) Turn the tester on.
(f) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST.
(g) Check the values by referring to the table below.
