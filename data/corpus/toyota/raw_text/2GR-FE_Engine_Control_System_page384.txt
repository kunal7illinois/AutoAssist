6. Second reference pressure measurement
Next sequence is run if the following conditions are met Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4
1. EVAP pressure just after reference pressure -1 kPa (-7.5 mmHg) or less
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.057 kPa (-36.384 to -7.929 mmHg)
3. Reference pressure Saturated
4. Difference between first reference pressure and
Less than 0.7 kPa (5.25 mmHg)
second reference pressure
7. Leak check
Next sequence is run if the following condition is met -
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction is complete Lower than second reference pressure
8. Atmospheric pressure measurement
EVAP monitor is complete if the following condition is
-
met
ES Atmospheric pressure difference between sequence 1
Within 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg)
and 8
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
EVAP pressure change after EVAP canister vent valve is ON Less than 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg)
