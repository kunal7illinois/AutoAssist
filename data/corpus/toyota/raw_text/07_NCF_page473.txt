SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM
(cid:2)DESCRIPTION
1. General
(cid:1) The driver and front passenger dual-stage SRS (Supplemental Restraint System) airbags supplement the
seat belts to help to reduce the shocks to the head and chest of the driver and front passenger in the event
of a frontal collision.
(cid:1) The SRS side and curtain shield airbags help to reduce the shocks to the head and chest of the driver, the
front passenger in the event of a side collision.
(cid:1) The SRS knee airbags help restrain the lower parts of the bodies of the driver, thus enhancing the excellent
passenger protection provided by the seat belts and front airbags.
(cid:1) A front passenger occupant classification system is used. This enables/disables the front passenger airbag
and front passenger side airbag by determining whether or not there is a front passenger seat occupant,
and whether it is an adult or child (or child seat), based on the load applied to the passenger seat and the
fitted condition of the front passenger seat belt.
(cid:1) The front passenger airbag door is designed to be invisible. This means that when the airbag inflates, the
instrument panel will split along the cleavage line.
(cid:1) The function of the airbag sensor assembly is to memorize the driver seat belt wearing condition while
the airbag is inflating.
(cid:1) A fuel cut control that stops the fuel pump when any airbags are deployed, is used. For details, see page
EG-58.
