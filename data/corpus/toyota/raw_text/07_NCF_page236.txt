CH-72 CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
Road Condition Support Control
Under road condition support control, ECT ECU determines the throttle valve opening angle and the vehicle
speed whether the vehicle is being driven uphill or downhill.
To achieve the optimal drive force while driving uphill, this control prevents the transaxle from up shifting
to the 5th or 6th gear. To achieve the optimal engine brake effect while driving downhill, this control
automatically downshifts the transaxle to the 5th or 4th or 3rd gear.
