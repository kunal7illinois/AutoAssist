• Following the A/F CONTROL procedure enables technicians to check and graph the voltage outputs of
both the A/F and HO2 sensors.
• To display the graph, enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST /
A/F CONTROL / USER DATA / AFS B1S1 and O2S B1S2 or AFS B2S1 and O2S B2S2, and press the
YES button and then the ENTER button followed by the F4 button.
HINT:
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
• If the OX1B wire from the ECM connector is short-circuited to the +B wire, DTC P0136 will be set.
• If the OX2B wire from the ECM connector is short-circuited to the +B wire, DTC P0156 will be set.
