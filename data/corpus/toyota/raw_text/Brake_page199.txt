BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
Zero Point Calibration of Yaw Rate Sensor
DTC C1210/36
Undone
Zero Point Calibration of Acceleration Sensor
DTC C1336/39
Undone
DESCRIPTION
The skid control ECU receives signals from the yaw rate and acceleration sensor via the CAN
communication system.
The yaw rate sensor has the built in acceleration sensor and detects the vehicle's condition using 2
circuits (GL1, GL2). If there is trouble in the bus lines between the yaw rate and acceleration sensor and
the CAN communication system, the DTCs U0123/62 (yaw rate sensor communication trouble) and
U0124/95 (acceleration sensor communication trouble) are output.
The DTCs are also output when the calibration has not been completed.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area

INSPECTION PROCEDURE
NOTICE:
When replacing the brake actuator assembly, perform zero point calibration (See page BC-119).
HINT:
When U0123/62, U0124/95 or U0126/63 is output along with C1210/36 or C1336/39, inspect and repair
trouble areas indicated by U0123/62, U0124/95 or U0126/63 first.
1 PERFORM ZERO POINT CALIBRATION OF YAW RATE AND ACCELERATION SENSOR
(a) Perform zero point calibration of the yaw rate and
acceleration sensor (See page BC-119).
NEXT
2 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-141).
(b) Check if the same DTCs are recorded (See page BC-
141).
Result
Condition Proceed to
DTCs (C1210/36 and/or C1336/39) are output A
DTCs (C1210/36 and/or C1336/39) are not output B
