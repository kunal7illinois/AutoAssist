ES–88
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
After the ECM sends the "target" duty-cycle signal to the OCV, the ECM monitors the OCV current to
establish an "actual" duty-cycle. The ECM detects a malfunction and sets a DTC when the actual duty-
cycle ratio varies from the target duty-cycle ratio.
