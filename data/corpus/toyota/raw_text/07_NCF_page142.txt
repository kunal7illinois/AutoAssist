Crankshaft Position Sensor
The timing rotor of the crankshaft consists of 34 teeth, with 2 teeth missing. The crankshaft position sensor
outputs the crankshaft rotation signals every 10(cid:4), and the missing teeth are used to determine the
top-dead-center.

Intake and Exhaust VVT Sensors
1) General
The MRE (Magnetic Resistance Element) type intake and exhaust VVT sensors are used. To detect the
camshaft position, a timing rotor that is secured to the camshaft in front of the VVT controller is used
to generate 6 (3 Hi Output, 3 Lo Output) pulses for every 2 revolutions of the crankshaft.
