AX–138
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
• There is a difference in rotation between the input side (engine speed) and output side (input turbine
speed) of the torque converter when the TCM commands lock-up.
(Engine speed is at least 70 rpm greater than input turbine speed.)
• There is no difference in rotation between the input side (engine speed) and output side (input turbine
speed) of the torque converter when the TCM commands lock-up off.
(The difference between engine speed and input turbine speed is less than 20 rpm.)
