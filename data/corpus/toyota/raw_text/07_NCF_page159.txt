EG-132 ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE
10. Cranking Hold Function (Models with Smart Key System)
General
(cid:3) Once the engine switch is pressed, this function continues to operate the starter until the engine has
started, provided that the brake pedal is depressed. This prevents starting failure and the engine from
being cranked after it has started.
(cid:3) When the ECM detects a start signal from the main body ECU, this system monitors the engine speed
(NE) signal and continues to operate the starter until it has determined that the engine has started.
Furthermore, even if the ECM detects a start signal from the main body ECU, this system will not operate
the starter if the ECM has determined that the engine has already started.
