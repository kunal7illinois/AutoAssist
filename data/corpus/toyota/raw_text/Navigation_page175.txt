NAVIGATION – NAVIGATION SYSTEM
Sound Signal Circuit between Radio and Navigation Assembly and
Stereo Jack Adapter
DESCRIPTION
The stereo jack adapter sends an external device sound signal to the radio and navigation assembly
through this circuit.
The sound signal that has been sent is amplified by the stereo component amplifier and then is sent to the
speakers.
If there is an open or short in the circuit, sound cannot be heard from the speakers even if there is no
malfunction in the stereo component amplifier, radio and navigation assembly, or speakers.
