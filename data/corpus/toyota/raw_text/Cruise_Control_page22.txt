CRUISE CONTROL – CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM
DTC P0571 Brake Switch "A" Circuit
DESCRIPTION
When the brake pedal is depressed, the stop light switch sends a signal to the ECM. When the ECM
receives this signal, it cancels the cruise control. The fail-safe function operates to enable normal driving
even if there is a malfunction in the stop light signal circuit. The cancellation condition occurs when
voltage is applied to terminal STP. When the brake is applied, voltage is normally applied to terminal STP
of the ECM through the STOP SW fuse and the stop light switch, and the ECM turns the cruise control off.
