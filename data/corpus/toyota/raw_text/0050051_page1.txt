ES–279
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Throttle Actuator Control Motor Current Range
DTC P2118
/ Performance
DESCRIPTION
The ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System) has a dedicated power supply circuit. The voltage (+BM)
is monitored and when it is low (less than 4 V), the ECM determines that there is a malfunction in the
ETCS and cuts off the current to the throttle actuator.
When the voltage becomes unstable, the ETCS itself becomes unstable. For this reason, when the
voltage is low, the current to the throttle actuator is cut. If repairs are made and the system returns to
normal, turn the ignition switch OFF. The ECM then allows the current to flow to the throttle actuator so
that it can be restarted.

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM monitors the battery supply voltage applied to the throttle actuator.
When the power supply voltage (+BM) drops below 4 V for 0.8 seconds or more, the ECM interprets this
as an open in the power supply circuit (+BM). The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, the DTC is set 5 seconds after the engine is next started.
