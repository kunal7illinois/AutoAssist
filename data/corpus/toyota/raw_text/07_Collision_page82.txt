INSTALLATION POINT
1 Before temporarily installing the new parts, apply body sealer to the reinforcement, side impact protection
beam and backside of the new parts.
HINT:
1) Apply sealer evenly about 10 mm (0.39 in.) from the flange and 3 mm (0.12 in.) in diameter on the outer
panel and apply just enough sealer for the reinforcement and side impact protection beam to make
contact.
2 Bend the flange hem about 30(cid:1) with a hammer and dolly. Then, fasten tightly with a hemming tool.
HINT:
1) Perform hemming in three steps, being careful not to warp the panel.
2) If a hemming tool cannot be used, hem with a hammer and dolly.
3 After applying the top coat, apply anti-rust agent to the internal panel portion of the closed section structural
weld points.
