BE-104 BODY ELECTRICAL - SMART KEY SYSTEM
When key battery is low
Step System Operation
To operate the push button start system when the key battery is low, hold the key against the
a)
engine switch as shown below while depressing the brake pedal.
The main body ECU receives the stop light switch signal and transmits a key certification
b)
request signal to the certification ECU.
The certification ECU does not receive an ID code response from the tuner, so it actuates the
c)
transponder key amplifier built into the engine switch.
d) The transponder key amplifier outputs an engine immobilizer radio wave to the key.
The key receives the radio wave, and returns a radio wave response to the transponder key
e)
amplifier.
The transponder key amplifier combines the key ID codes with the radio wave response, and
f)
transmits it to the certification ECU.
The certification ECU judges and verifies the ID code, and transmits a key certification OK
g)
signal to the main body ECU. The buzzer in the combination meter sounds at the same time.
After the buzzer sounds, if the engine switch is pressed within five seconds while the brake
h) pedal is depressed, the power source switches to start the engine running, the same as with
normal smart key operation.
After the buzzer sounds, if the engine switch is pressed within five seconds while the brake
i) pedal is not depressed, the power source will be switched to ACC or IG-ON, the same as with
normal smart key operation.
