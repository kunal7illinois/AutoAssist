BC–111
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
(1) Operation description
The skid control ECU receives the speed signal
from each speed sensor and the fluid pressure
signal from the master cylinder pressure sensor
to determine whether brake assist is necessary.
If brake assist is necessary, the skid control ECU
sends control signals to the pump motor and
solenoid. The pump and the solenoid valve then
control the pressure applied to each wheel
cylinder.
The ABS warning light comes on to indicate a
malfunction in the BA system.
