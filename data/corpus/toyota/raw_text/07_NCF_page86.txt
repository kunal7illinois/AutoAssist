ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-59
10. Cooling Fan Control System
A cooling fan control system in which the ECM controls the cooling fan speed in accordance with the engine
coolant temperature and the air conditioning operating condition.
(cid:3) The ECM controls the cooling fan speed based on A/C pressure sensor signals and engine coolant
temperature sensor signals. The A/C pressure sensor signals are sent from the A/C ECU to the ECM via
the CAN. This control is accomplished by operating the 2 fan motors in 2 stages at low speed (series
connection) and high speed (parallel connection).
