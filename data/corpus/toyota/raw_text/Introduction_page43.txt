(1) Disconnect connectors A and C and measure
ECU the resistance between the terminals of the
connectors.

HINT:
Measure the resistance while lightly shaking the
wire harness vertically and horizontally. If the
results match the examples above, an open
circuit exists between terminal 1 of connector A
and terminal 1 of connector C.
(2) Disconnect connector B and measure the

resistance between the terminals of the
ECU
connectors.

connector B2 and terminal 1 of connector C.
(c) Check the voltage.

(1) In a circuit in which voltage is applied to the ECU
connector terminal, an open circuit can be
ECU
checked by conducting a voltage check.
