14. INSPECT 1ST AND REVERSE BRAKE RETURN
SPRING SUB-ASSEMBLY
(a) Using vernier calipers, measure the free length of
the 1st and reverse brake return spring together
with the spring seat.
Standard free length:
AX
15.79 mm (0.6217 in.)
If the free length is shorter than the standard free
length, replace the 1st and reverse brake return
spring.

15. INSPECT CLEARANCE OF NO. 2 BRAKE
(a) Using a dial indicator, measure the clearance of the
No. 2 brake while applying compressed air (200
kPa, 2.0 kgf/cm2, 29 psi).
Standard clearance:
0.884 to 1.196 mm (0.0348 to 0.0471 in.)
HINT:
Measure the clearance at 3 points where the brake
piston diameter is approximately 140 mm (5.51 in.)
and calculate the average.
If the clearance is not as specified, select an
appropriate No. 2 brake flange so that the clearance
will be within the specified range.
HINT:
There are 5 different thicknesses of flanges
available.
No. 2 brake flange thickness: mm (in.)

16. INSPECT CLEARANCE OF NO. 1 BRAKE
(a) Using a dial indicator, measure the clearance of the
No. 1 brake while applying compressed air (200
kPa, 2.0 kgf/cm2, 29 psi).
Standard clearance:
0.807 to 0.974 mm (0.0318 to 0.0383 in.)
HINT:
Measure the clearance at 3 points where the brake
piston diameter is approximately 140 mm (5.51 in.)
and calculate the average.
If the clearance is not as specified, select an
appropriate No. 1 brake flange so that the clearance
will be within the specified range.
HINT:
There are 6 different thicknesses of flanges
available.
No. 1 brake flange thickness: mm (in.)
