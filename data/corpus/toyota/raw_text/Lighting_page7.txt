• Side marker lights
• Parking lights
Light control switch HEAD signal Headlight relay drive signal Low beam headlights
2. AUTOMATIC LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM
When the light control switch is in the AUTO position, the
automatic light control sensor detects ambient light,
converts it into an electrical signal, and outputs it to the
main body ECU. The main body ECU automatically turns
the headlights and taillights on or off according to the
signal.
