ES–57
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
FAIL-SAFE CHART
If any of the following DTCs are set, the ECM enters fail-safe
mode to allow the vehicle to be driven temporarily.
Fail-Safe Deactivation
DTCs Components Fail-Safe Operations
Conditions
Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) Sensor
P0031, P0032, P0051 and P0052 ECM turns off A/F sensor heater Ignition switch off
Heater
Heated Oxygen (HO2) Sensor
P0037, P0038, P0057 and P0058 ECM turns off HO2 sensor heater Ignition switch off
Heater
ECM calculates ignition timing
P0100, P0102 and P0103 Mass Air Flow (MAF) Meter according to engine speed and Pass condition detected
throttle valve position
Intake Air Temperature (IAT) ECM estimates IAT to be 20°C
P0110, P0112 and P0113 Pass condition detected
Sensor (68°F)
Engine Coolant Temperature ECM estimates ECT to be 80°C
P0115, P0117 and P0118 Pass condition detected ES
(ECT) Sensor (176°F)
ECM cuts off throttle actuator
current and throttle valve returned
to 6.5° throttle position by return
P0120, P0121, P0122, P0123, spring
P0220, P0222, P0223, P0604, ECM then adjusts engine output
Electronic Throttle Control Pass condition detected and then
P0606, P0607, P0657, P2102, by controlling fuel injection
System (ETCS) ignition switch turned off
P2103, P2111, P2112, P2118, (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition
P2119 and P2135 timing in accordance with
accelerator pedal opening angle,
to allow vehicle to continue at
minimal speed*
ECM sets ignition timing to
P0327, P0328, P0332 and P0333 Knock Sensor Ignition switch off
maximum retard
P0351 to P0356 Igniter ECM cuts fuel Pass condition detected
APP sensor has 2 sensor circuits:
Main and Sub
If either of circuits malfunctions,
ECM controls engine using the
P2120, P2121, P2122, P2123, Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) other circuit Pass condition detected and then
P2125, P2127, P2128 and P2138 Sensor If both of circuits malfunction, ignition switch turned off
ECM regards accelerator pedal
as being released. As a result,
throttle valve is closed and engine
idles
NOTE:
*: The vehicle can be driven slowly when the accelerator
pedal is depressed slowly. If the accelerator pedal is
depressed quickly, the vehicle may speed up and slow down
erratically.
