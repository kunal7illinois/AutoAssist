BRAKE CONTROL – ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM
3 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL WAVEFORM
(a) Lift up the vehicle.
Front Speed Sensor (Wire Harness Side) (b) Perform the inspection using an oscilloscope.
Connector Front View: (1) Disconnect the front speed sensor connector.
(2) Connect the oscilloscope to terminals 1 and 2 of the
front speed sensor.
A14 A35
(3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
OK:
The same waveform is output from front
FL- FL+ FR- FR+
wheels and there is no noise or interference in
Normal Signal Waveform:
the waveform.
HINT:
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
GND and the output voltage becomes greater. BC
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign
1 V/Division, 2 ms./Division matter attached to the speed sensor.
(c) Connect the connector.

OK
4 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Clear the DTCs (See page BC-21).
(b) Drive the vehicle at a speed of approximately 25 mph (40
km/h) or more for 60 seconds or more.
(c) Check if the same DTCs are recorded (See page BC-
21).
HINT:
Reinstall the sensors, connectors, etc. and restore the
vehicle to its prior condition before rechecking for DTCs.
