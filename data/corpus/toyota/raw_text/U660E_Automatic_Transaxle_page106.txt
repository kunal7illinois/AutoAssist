AX–106
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
Pressure Control Solenoid "C" Performance
DTC P0796
(Shift Solenoid Valve SL3)
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The TCM uses the vehicle speed signal to determine the actual gear position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th
AX
gear).
Then the TCM compares the actual gear with the shift schedule in the TCM memory to detect shift
solenoid valves and valve body mechanical problems.
DTC No. DTC Detecting Condition Trouble Area
The engine revs freely when 2nd or 6th gear is
requested (2-trip detection logic). • Shift solenoid valve SL3 remains open or closed.
P0796 When the following is detected twice (2-trip detection • Valve body is blocked.
logic): • Automatic transaxle (clutch, brake or gear etc.)
• When 1st gear is requested, 2nd gear is engaged.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The TCM commands gear shifts by turning the shift solenoid valves on or off. According to the input shaft
revolution, intermediate (counter) shaft revolution and output shaft revolution, the TCM detects the actual
gear position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th gear position). When the gear position commanded by the
TCM and the actual gear position are not the same, the TCM illuminates the MIL and stores the DTC.
