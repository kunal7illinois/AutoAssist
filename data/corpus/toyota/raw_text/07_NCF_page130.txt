ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-103
3. Spark Plug
(cid:3) Long-reach type spark plugs are used. This type of spark plugs allows the area of the cylinder head to
receive the spark plugs to be made thick. Thus, the water jacket can be extended near the combustion
chamber, which contributes to cooling performance.
(cid:3) Iridium-tipped spark plugs are used to achieve a 120,000 miles (193,000 km) maintenance interval. By
making the center electrode of iridium, the superior ignition performance as platinum-tipped spark plugs
is achieved and durability has been increased.

(cid:4)CHARGING SYSTEM
(cid:3) As on the 2GR-FE engine model, a compact and lightweight segment conductor type alternator (SE0 type)
that generates a high amperage output in a highly efficient manner is used as standard equipment.
(cid:3) A generator pulley with a clutch is used.
(cid:3) For details of this alternator, refer to 2AZ-FE Engine Charging System on page EG-28.
(cid:4)STARTING SYSTEM
(cid:3) As on the 2GR-FE engine model, a compact and lightweight PS (Planetary reduction - Segment conductor
motor) type starter (PS1.7 type) is used as standard equipment.
(cid:3) For details of this stator, refer to 2AZ-FE Engine Starting System on page EG-30.
