(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
(c) Turn the tester ON.
(d) Clear DTCs (see page ES-35).
(e) Start the engine, and warm it up until the ECT reaches 75°C (167°F) or higher.
(f) On the intelligent tester, select the following menu items to check the fuel-cut status: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / USER DATA / FC IDL.
(g) Drive the vehicle at between 60 km/h (38 mph) and 120 km/h (75 mph) for at least 10 minutes.
(h) Change the transmission to 2nd gear.
(i) Drive the vehicle at proper vehicle speed to perform fuel-cut operation.
HINT:
Fuel-cut is performed when the following conditions are met:
• Accelerator pedal fully released.
• Engine speed is 2,500 rpm or more (fuel injection returns at 1,000 rpm).
(j) Accelerate the vehicle to 64 km/h (40 mph) or more by depressing the accelerator pedal for at least 10
seconds.
(k) Soon after performing step (j) above, release the accelerator pedal for at least 4 seconds without
depressing the brake pedal, in order to execute fuel-cut control.
(l) Allow the vehicle to decelerate until the vehicle speed declines to less than 10 km/h (6 mph).
(m) Repeat steps from (h) through (k) above at least 3 times in one driving cycle.
HINT:
Completion of all A/F sensor monitors is required to change the value in TEST RESULT.
CAUTION:
Strictly observe posted speed limits, traffic laws, and road conditions when performing these
drive patterns.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Intelligent tester only:
Malfunctioning areas can be identified by performing the A/F CONTROL function provided in the ACTIVE
TEST. The A/F CONTROL function can help to determine whether the Air-fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor, Heated
Oxygen (HO2) sensor and other potential trouble areas are malfunctioning.
