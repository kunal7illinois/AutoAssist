(2) Multipath
Multipath Multipath is a type of interference created when
a vehicle receives 2 radio wave signals from the
same transmitter. One signal is reflected off
buildings or mountains and the other signal is
received directly from the transmitter.

(3) Fade out
Fade Out Fade out is caused by objects (buildings,
mountains, and other such large obstacles) that
deflect away part of a signal, resulting in a
weaker signal when the object is between the
transmitter and vehicle. High frequency radio
waves, such as FM broadcasts, are easily
deflected by obstructions. Low frequency radio
waves, such as AM broadcasts, are much more
difficult to deflect.

(d) Noise problem
Technicians must have a clear understanding about
each customer's noise complaint. Use the following
table to diagnose noise problems.
Radio Frequency Noise Occurrence Condition Presumable Cause
AM Noise occurs in a specified area Foreign noise
An identical program transmitted from
AM Noise occurs when listening to an intermittent broadcast multiple towers can cause noise where the
signals overlap
AM Noise occurs only at night Music beat from a distant broadcast
Multipath or phasing noise resulting from a
FM Noise occurs while driving in a specified area
change in FM frequency
HINT:
If the noise does not match the examples above, refer to the
descriptions about phasing and multipath.
