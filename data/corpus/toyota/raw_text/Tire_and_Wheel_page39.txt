DESCRIPTION
The tire pressure warning valve and transmitters that are installed in the tire and wheel assemblies
measure the air pressures of the tires. The measured values are transmitted to the tire pressure warning
TW antenna and receiver on the body as radio waves and then sent to the tire pressure warning ECU. The
ECU compares the measured air pressure values with the air pressure threshold. When the measured air
pressure value is less than this threshold, the warning light in the combination meter comes on. The tire
pressure warning ECU stores a DTC when the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter stops
transmitting signals. At this time, forcibly transmit the signals by releasing the tire pressure rapidly. The
stored DTC is cleared when the signal transmission is resumed.

HINT:
