(cid:2)ATF FILLING PROCEDURES
(cid:1) The ATF filling procedure is changed in order to improve the accuracy of the ATF level when the transaxle
is being repaired or replaced. As a result, the oil filler tube and the oil level gauge used for a conventional
automatic transaxle are discontinued, eliminating the need to inspect the fluid level as a part of routine
maintenance.
(cid:1) This filling procedure employs a refill plug, overflow plug, ATF temperature sensor, and shift indicator
light “D”. After the transaxle is refilled with ATF, remove the overflow plug and drain the extra ATF at
the proper ATF temperature. Thus, the appropriate ATF level can be obtained. For details about the ATF
filling procedure, refer to the Service Tip on the next page.
