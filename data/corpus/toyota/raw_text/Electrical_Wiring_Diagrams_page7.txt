B HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
[O] System Outline
Current is applied at all times through the STOP fuse to TERMINAL 2 of the stop lamp SW.
When the ignition SW is turned on, current flows from the GAUGE fuse to TERMINAL 8 of the light failure sensor, and also flows
through the rear lights warning light to TERMINAL 4 of the light failure sensor.
Stop Light Disconnection Warning
When the ignition SW is turned on and the brake pedal is pressed (Stop lamp SW on), if the stop light circuit is open, the current
flowing from TERMINAL 7 of the light failure sensor to TERMINALS 1, 2 changes, so the light failure sensor detects the
disconnection and the warning circuit of the light failure sensor is activated.
As a result, the current flows from TERMINAL 4 of the light failure sensor to TERMINAL 11 to GROUND and turns the rear lights
warning light on. By pressing the brake pedal, the current flowing to TERMINAL 8 of the light failure sensor keeps the warning
circuit on and holds the warning light on until the ignition SW is turned off.
