EG-88 ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE
2. Camshaft
(cid:1) The camshafts are made of cast iron alloy.
(cid:1) An oil passage is provided on the intake and exhaust camshaft in order to supply engine oil to the VVT-i
system.
(cid:1) A VVT-i controller has been installed on the front of the intake and exhaust camshaft to vary the timing
of the intake and exhaust valves.
(cid:1) Together with the use of the roller rocker arm, the cam profile has been designed with an indented R
(radius). This results in increased valve lift when the valve begins to open and finishes closing, helping
to achieve enhanced output performance.

3. Timing Chain and Chain Tensioner
(cid:1) Both the primary and secondary timing chains use roller chains with a pitch of 9.525 mm (0.375 in.).
(cid:1) The timing chain is lubricated by an oil jet.
(cid:1) The primary chain uses one timing chain tensioner and each of the secondary chains for the right and left
banks uses one timing chain tensioner.
(cid:1) Both the primary and secondary chain tensioners use a spring and oil pressure to maintain proper chain
tension at all times. They suppress noise generated by the timing chains.
(cid:1) The chain tensioner for the primary chain is the ratchet type with a non-return mechanism.
