(e) SPOT WELDING PRECAUTIONS
(1) The shape of the tip point of the spot welder signifi-
cantly affects the strength of the weld. Therefore,
maintain the tip point in the proper shape, and allow it
to cool after every five or six spots.
(2) Completely remove the paint from the areas to be spot
welded, including the seams and the surfaces that
come in contact with the welding tip.
(3) Use a sander to remove any burrs that are created
