mm (0.39 in.) away from the outer edge of the disc.
Maximum disc runout:
0.05 mm (0.0020 in)

(c) If the runout exceeds the maximum value, change
C132800E02
the installation positions of the disc and axle so that
the runout will become minimal. If the runout
exceeds the maximum even after the installation
positions are changed, check the bearing play in the
axial direction and the axle hub runout (See page
AH-16). If the bearing play and the axle hub runout
are normal and if the disc thickness is not within the
specified range, grind the disc. If the disc thickness
is less than the minimum, replace the disc.
(d) Remove the front disc.
