DESCRIPTION
ES A flat type knock sensor (non-resonant type) has a structure that can detect vibrations over a wide band of
frequencies: between approximately 6 kHz and 15 kHz.
Knock sensors are fitted onto the engine block to detect engine knocking.
The knock sensor contains a piezoelectric element which generates a voltage when it becomes deformed.
The voltage is generated when the engine block vibrates due to knocking. Any occurrence of engine
knocking can be suppressed by delaying the ignition timing.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
• Short in knock sensor 1 or 2 circuit
P0327 Output voltage of knock sensor 1 or 2 is 0.5 V or less
• Knock sensor 1 or 2
P0332 (1 trip detection logic)
• ECM
• Open in knock sensor 1 or 2 circuit
P0328 Output voltage of knock sensor 1 or 2 is 4.5 V or more
• Knock sensor 1 or 2
P0333 (1 trip detection logic)
• ECM
HINT:
When any of DTCs P0327, P0328, P0332 and P0333 are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-
safe mode, the ignition timing is delayed to its maximum retardation. Fail-safe mode continues until the
engine switch is turned off.
