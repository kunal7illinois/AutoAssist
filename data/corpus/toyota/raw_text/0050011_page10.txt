HINT:
*: When cranking the engine, each cylinder measures the
engine rpm.
In this ACTIVE TEST, the fuel and ignition of all cylinders is
cut, and cranking occurs for approximately 10 seconds. Then,
each cylinder measures the engine rpm. If a cylinder's engine
rpm is higher than the others, that cylinder's compression
ES
pressure is compared to the others, and whether or not the
compression pressure is low can be determined.
1. Warm up the engine.
2. Turn the ignition switch OFF.
3. Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
4. Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the intelligent tester
ON.

measurement will enter standby.
7. Fully open the throttle.
8. Crank the engine for about 10 seconds.
9. Monitor the engine speed (ENG SPEED #1 to #4)
displayed on the tester.
HINT:
At first, the tester's display will show each cylinder's
engine rpm measurement to be extremely high. After
approximately 10 seconds of engine cranking, each
cylinder's engine rpm measurement will change to the
actual engine rpm.
NOTICE:
• After the ACTIVE TEST's COMPRESS CHECK is
A130535
turned ON, it will automatically turn off after 255
seconds.
