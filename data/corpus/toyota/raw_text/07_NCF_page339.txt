BODY ELECTRICAL - MULTIPLEX COMMUNICATION BE-5
— REFERENCE —
MPX communication uses serial communication data that consists of bits and frames in order to exchange
information among the various ECUs. This allows a reduction of the amount of wiring on the vehicle.
(cid:3) A bit is the basic unit of communication that is used to represent the information. A bit is represented by
binary values of “0” or “1”.
(cid:3) A frame is a body of data that is transmitted together. A frame contains a header that indicates the
beginning, and an end message that indicates the end.
