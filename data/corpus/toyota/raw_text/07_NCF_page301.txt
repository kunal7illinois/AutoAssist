CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-137
13. Diagnosis
General
If the skid control ECU detects a malfunction in the brake control system (ABS with EBD, brake assist,
TRAC and VSC), the ABS, brake system, master warning lights and multi-information display the
corresponds to the function for which the malfunction has been detected illuminates or indicates, as
indicated in the table below, to alert the drive of the malfunction.

*3: Failure in the ABS, EBD, and brake assist systems prohibits operation of the TRAC, VSC systems.
Accordingly, the VSC or master warning lights will be illuminated and the “CHECK VSC” message will
appear on the multi-information display.
(cid:3) At the same time, the DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) are stored in the memory. The DTC can be read
by connecting SST (09843-18040) between the Tc and CG terminals of the DLC3, and observing the
blinking of the ABS warning light or the observing the diagnostic code indicated on the
multi-information display, connecting a hand-held tester.
(cid:3) This system has a sensor signal check (test mode) function. This function is activated by connecting the
SST (09843-18040) between the Ts and CG terminal of the DLC3 or by connecting a hand-held tester.
The ABS warning light and VSC warning light blinks at a 0.25-second interval. This check function
performs deceleration sensor check, yaw rate sensor check, master cylinder pressure sensor check, and
speed sensor check.
