TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
(cid:4)DESCRIPTION
(cid:3) A direct-sensing type tire pressure warning system is used on U.S.A. model.
(cid:3) If the vehicle continues to be driven with 1 or more of the 5 tires (which includes the standard type spare
tire*) inflated to a low air pressure that could cause problems during driving, this system will illuminate
the tire pressure warning light to inform the driver of the low air pressure.
(cid:3) Furthermore, this system directly senses the air pressure of each tire through tire pressure warning system
valve & transmitter that are attached to each wheel.
(cid:3) After tire replacement, firstly register tire pressure warning system valve & transmitter IDs into the tire
pressure warning system ECU, and then store the appropriate tire pressure in the ECU using the tire
pressure warning system reset switch.
