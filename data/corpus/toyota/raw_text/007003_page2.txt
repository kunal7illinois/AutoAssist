Gear rotates in advance direction.
HINT:
This operation releases the lock pin for the
extreme retard position.
(5) When the camshaft timing gear reaches the
extreme advance position, remove the air gun
from the retard side path and advance side
path, in that order.
NOTICE:
Do not remove the air gun from the advance
side path first. The gear may abruptly shift
in the retard direction and break the lock
pin.
(c) Check for smooth rotation.
(1) Rotate the camshaft timing gear within its
movable range several times, but do not turn it
to the extreme retard position. Check that the
gear rotates smoothly.
OK:
Gear rotates smoothly.
