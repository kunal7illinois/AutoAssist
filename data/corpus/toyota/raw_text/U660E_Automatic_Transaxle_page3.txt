DEFINITION OF TERMS
Term Definition
Monitor description Description of what the TCM monitors and how it detects malfunctions (monitoring purpose and its details).
Related DTCs Diagnostic code
Preconditions that allow the TCM to detect malfunctions.
AX
Typical enabling condition With all preconditions satisfied, the TCM sets the DTC when the monitored value(s) exceeds the
malfunction threshold(s).
The priority order that is applied to monitoring, if multiple sensors and components are used to detect the
malfunction.
Sequence of operation
While another sensor is being monitored, the next sensor or component will not be monitored until the
previous monitoring has concluded.
Required sensor/components The sensors and components that are used by the TCM to detect malfunctions.
The number of times that the TCM checks for malfunctions per driving cycle.
"Once per driving cycle" means that the TCM detects malfunction only one time during a single driving
Frequency of operation
cycle.
"Continuous" means that the TCM detects malfunction every time when the enabling conditions are met.
The minimum time that the TCM must sense a continuous deviation in the monitored value(s) before

setting a DTC. This timing begins after the "typical enabling conditions" are met.
Malfunction thresholds Beyond this value, the TCM will conclude that there is a malfunction and set a DTC.
MIL illumination timing after a defect is detected.
"Immediately" means that the TCM illuminates MIL the instant the TCM determines that there is a
MIL operation malfunction.
"2 driving cycle" means that the TCM illuminates MIL if the same malfunction is detected again in the 2nd
driving cycle.
Normal operation range of sensors and solenoids under normal driving conditions.
Component operating range Use these ranges as a reference.
They cannot be used to judge if a sensor or solenoid is defective.
