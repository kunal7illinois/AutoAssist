2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
9. Drive the vehicle at a proper vehicle speed to perform fuel-cut operation (refer to the following HINT )
(Procedure "D").
HINT:
Fuel-cut is performed when the following conditions are met:
• Accelerator pedal is fully released.
• Engine speed is 2,500 rpm or more (fuel injection resumes at 1,000 rpm).
10.Accelerate the vehicle to 40 rpm (64 km/h) or more by depressing the accelerator pedal for at least 10
seconds (Procedure "E").
11.Soon after performing procedure E above, release the accelerator pedal for at least 4 seconds without
depressing the brake pedal, in order to execute fuel-cut control (Procedure "F").
12.Allow the vehicle to decelerate until the vehicle speed declines to less than 6 mph (10 km/h).
13.Repeat procedure from C through F above at least 3 times in one driving cycle.
HINT:
Completion of all A/F sensor monitors is required to change the value in TEST RESULT.
CAUTION:
ES
Strictly observe posted speed limits, traffic laws, and road conditions when performing these
drive patterns.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Malfunctioning areas can be identified by performing the A/F CONTROL function provided in the ACTIVE
TEST. The A/F CONTROL function can help to determine whether the Air-fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor, Heated
Oxygen (HO2) sensor and other potential trouble areas are malfunctioning.
The following instructions describe how to conduct the A/F CONTROL operation using the intelligent
tester.
1. Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
2. Start the engine and turn the tester on.
3. Warm up the engine at an engine speed of 2,500 rpm for approximately 90 seconds.
4. On the intelligent tester, enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST
/ A/F CONTROL.
5. Perform the A/F CONTROL operation with the engine in an idling condition (press the RIGHT or LEFT
button to change the fuel injection volume).
6. Monitor the output voltages of the A/F and HO2 sensors (AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2 or AFS B2 S1
and O2S B2 S2) displayed on the tester.
HINT:
• The A/F CONTROL operation lowers the fuel injection volume by 12.5 % or increases the injection
volume by 25 %.
• Each sensor reacts in accordance with increases in the fuel injection volume.
Tester Display
Injection Volume Status Voltage
(Sensor)
AFS B1S1 or AFS B2S1
+25 % Rich Less than 3.0 V
(A/F)
AFS B1S1 or AFS B2S1
-12.5 % Lean More than 3.35 V
(A/F)
O2S B1S2 or O2S B2S2
+25 % Rich More than 0.55 V
(HO2)
O2S B1S2 or O2S B2S2
-12.5 % Lean Less than 0.4 V
(HO2)
NOTICE:
The Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor has an output delay of a few seconds and the HO2S (sensor 2)
output has a maximum output delay of 20 seconds.
