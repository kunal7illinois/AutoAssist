DOOR LOCK – DOOR CONTROL TRANSMITTER (w/ Smart Key System)
INSPECTION
1. INSPECT DOOR CONTROL TRANSMITTER
(a) Inspect operation of the transmitter.
(1) Remove the battery (lithium battery) from the
transmitter (See page DL-210).
(2) Install a new or normal battery (lithium battery).
HINT:
If a new or normal battery is not available, first
connect 2 new 1.5 V batteries in series. Then
connect leads to the batteries and apply 3 V to
the transmitter, as shown in the illustration.
(3) From outside the vehicle, approximately 1 m
(3.28 ft.) away from the driver side outside door
handle, test the transmitter by pointing its key
plate at the vehicle and pressing a transmitter
B128411
switch.
OK:
The door lock can be operated via the
transmitter.
The LED comes on more than once.
• The operational area differs depending on
the user, the way the transmitter is held, and
the location.
• The transmitter's faint electric waves may be
affected if the area has strong electric waves
or noise. The transmitter's operation area
may be shortened or the transmitter may not
function.
(b) Inspect the battery capacity.
HINT:
• When checking the amount of energy left in the
battery (lithium battery), the battery must be
checked while it is installed in the transmitter (a
resistance of 1.2 kΩ is applied to the battery).
When the battery energy is checked by itself
(removed from the vehicle), the voltage reading
will be more than 2.5 V until the energy is
depleted.
• If the transmitter is malfunctioning, the voltage
reading of the energy left in the battery will be
DL
inaccurate.
(1) Remove the battery (lithium battery) from the
transmitter (See page DL-210).
(2) Connect a wire to the negative (-) terminal of
the transmitter and install the battery.
