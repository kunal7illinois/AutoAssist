RL+ RR- (3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
OK:
The same waveforms is output from rear
wheels and there is no noise or interference in
the waveform.
HINT:

• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
Normal Signal Waveform: and the output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to the speed sensor.
