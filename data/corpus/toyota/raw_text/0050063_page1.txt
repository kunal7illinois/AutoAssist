ES–385
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Fuel Pump Control Circuit
DESCRIPTION
When the engine is cranked, the starter relay drive signal output from the STAR terminal of the ECM is
input into the STA terminal of the ECM, and NE signal generated by the crankshaft position sensor is also
input into the NE+ terminal. Thus, the ECM interprets that the engine is cranked, and turns the transistor
Tr1 in the ECM internal circuit ON. The current flows to the C/OPN (Circuit Opening) relay by turning the
Tr1 ON. Then, the fuel pump operates.
While the NE signal is input into the ECM, when the engine is running, the ECM turns the Tr1 on
continuously.
