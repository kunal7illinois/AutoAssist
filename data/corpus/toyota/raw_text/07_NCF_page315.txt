CHASSIS - STEERING CH-151
(cid:3)STEERING LOCK SYSTEM (Only for Models with Smart Key System)
According with the use of the smart key system, a steering lock system which uses a lock/unlock motor to
lock and unlock the steering wheel is used. This system mainly consists of the steering lock assembly, main
body ECU, certification ECU and ID code box.
(cid:3) The steering lock ECU is integrated in the steering lock assembly, and it controls the lock bar operation
in the steering lock assembly through the control of lock/unlock motor.
(cid:3) The steering lock ECU detects the position (lock/unlock) of the lock bar and transmits this information
to the main body ECU and certification ECU.
(cid:3) In this system, the certification ECU determines whether to lock or unlock the steering based on
communication with the main body ECU. Then, the certification ECU sends lock or unlock command
signals to the steering lock ECU through the ID code box. Upon receiving the signals, the steering lock
ECU operates the lock/unlock motor to lock or unlock the steering. For details, see page BE-91.
