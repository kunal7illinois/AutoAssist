2AZ-FE COOLING – COOLING FAN SYSTEM
ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
HINT:
It is normal for the cooling fan to sometimes rotate when the
ignition switch is turned from ACC to ON.
1. CHECK COOLING FAN OPERATION AT LOW
TEMPERATURES (Below 94°C (201°F))
(a) Turn the ignition switch ON with the A/C switch OFF.
(b) Check that the cooling fan stops.
If it does not, check the cooling fan relays and
engine coolant temperature sensor, and then check
for disconnection of the connector or a wire break
between the cooling fan relay and engine coolant
temperature sensor.

(c) Disconnect the engine coolant temperature sensor
connector.
A112176
(d) Check that the cooling fan rotates.
If it does not, check the fuses, cooling fan relays,
CO
ECM and cooling fan, and then check for an open
circuit between the cooling fan relay and engine
coolant temperature sensor.
(e) Reconnect the engine coolant temperature sensor
connector.
2. CHECK COOLING FAN OPERATION AT HIGH
TEMPERATURES (Above 96°C (205°F))
A127843 (a) Start the engine, and then raise the coolant
temperature to above 96°C (205°F).
HINT:
Coolant temperature is the value detected by the
engine coolant temperature sensor on the cylinder
head.
(b) Check that the A/C switch is OFF.
