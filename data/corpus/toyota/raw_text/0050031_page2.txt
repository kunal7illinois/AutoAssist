ES–176
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
If the output voltage transmitted by the knock sensor remains low or high for more than 1 second, the
ECM interprets this as a malfunction in the sensor circuit, and sets a DTC.
The monitor for DTCs P0327 and P0328 begins to run when 5 seconds have elapsed since the engine
was started.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, either DTC P0327 or P0328 is set 5 seconds after the
engine is next started.
MONITOR STRATEGY
P0327: Knock sensor range check (Low voltage)
Related DTCs
P0328: Knock sensor range check (High voltage)
