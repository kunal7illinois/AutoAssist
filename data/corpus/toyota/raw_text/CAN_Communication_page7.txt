CAN COMMUNICATION – CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
1. BRIEF DESCRIPTION
(a) Two different CAN busses are used. The CAN
busses are classified into two types based on typical
communication speed.
The HS-CAN bus is a high-speed communication
bus that is used for powertrain, chassis, and some
body electrical communication. The HS-CAN bus is
referred to as the "CAN bus" and it operates at
speeds of approximately 500 kbps. Terminating
resistors for the HS-CAN bus are located in the
ECM and combination meter.
The MS-CAN bus is a medium-speed
communication bus that is used for body electrical
communication. The MS-CAN bus is referred to as
the "MS bus" and it operates at speeds of
approximately 250 kbps. Terminating resistors for
the MS-CAN bus are located in the main body ECU
and the certification ECU. The resistance of the MS-
CAN bus cannot be measured from the DLC3 CA
connector.
Communication between these two networks is
handled via the main body ECU, which acts as a
gateway ECU.
(b) By pairing the CANH and CANL bus wires, the CAN
performs communication based on differential
voltage.
(c) Many ECUs (sensors) installed on the vehicle
operate by sharing information and communicating
with each other.
(d) The CAN has two resistors of 120 Ω which are
necessary to enable communication on the main
bus wire.
2. DEFINITION OF TERMS
(a) Main bus wire
(1) The main bus wire is a wire harness between
the two terminus circuits on the bus
(communication line).
(b) Branch wire
(1) The branch wire is a wire harness which
diverges from the main bus wire to an ECU or
sensor.
