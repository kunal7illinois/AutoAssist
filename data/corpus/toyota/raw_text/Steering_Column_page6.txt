ELECTRIC STEERING LOCK
PRECAUTION
1. PRECAUTIONS WHEN WORKING ON ELECTRIC
STEERING LOCK
(a) After replacing the steering lock actuator assembly
(steering lock ECU), perform the key ID code
registration.
(b) If the steering lock actuator assembly is replaced,
open and close the driver's door. The engine may
not start until the driver's door is opened or closed.
HINT:
Opening and closing the driver's door causes the
steering lock actuator assembly (steering lock ECU)
to memorize the correct steering lock bar position.
(c) If checking for DTCs of the smart access system
with push-button start function or if checking the
DATA LIST with the engine switch off, make sure
that the driver's door is open.
HINT:
When the engine switch is off, the main body ECU
may be in a sleep mode. If the main body ECU is in
SR this sleep mode, it will not be possible for the
intelligent tester to communicate with it. Opening
and closing the driver's door will cause the ECU to
exit the sleep mode.
