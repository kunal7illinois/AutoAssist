(cid:1)ENGINE MOUNT
1. General
A 3-point support on the front sub-frame is used. An active control engine mount is used on the front engine
mount and a liquid-filled compound engine mount is used on the right and left engine mounts to realize low
noise and vibration and to achieve high levels of both riding comfort and drivability.

2. Active Control Engine Mount
The operating range of the active control engine mount is during idling under the engine speed of 900 rpm.
Signals that are synchronized to the engine speed are sent by the ECM to the VSV and the engine vacuum
is utilized to vary the pressure of the intake air chamber in the active control engine mount. As a result, the
diaphragm vibrates, and using the liquid as a medium, the rubber mount vibrates. This vibration of the engine
mount acts to cancel out the engine vibration during idle, thus reducing the vibration and noise at idle. The
engine mount’s damping force to generate vibrations is adjusted through the effects of the orifice and the side
branch.
