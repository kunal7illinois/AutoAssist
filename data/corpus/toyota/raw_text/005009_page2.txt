2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
FREEZE FRAME DATA
1. DESCRIPTION
Freeze frame data records the engine conditions (fuel
system, calculated load, engine coolant temperature,
fuel trim, engine speed, vehicle speed, etc.) when a
malfunction is detected. When troubleshooting, it can
help determine if the vehicle was running or stopped, the
engine was warmed up or not, the air-fuel ratio was Lean
or Rich, and other data from the time the malfunction
occurred.
HINT:
If it is impossible to duplicate the problem even though a
ES DTC is detected, confirm the freeze frame data.
The ECM records engine conditions in the form of freeze
frame data every 0.5 seconds. Using the intelligent
DTC set.
tester, 5 separate sets of freeze frame data can be
checked.
– 3 data sets before the DTC was set.
0.5 seconds0.5 seconds0.5 seconds
– 1 data set when the DTC was set.
– 1 data set after the DTC was set.
These data sets can be used to simulate the condition
of the vehicle around the time of the occurrence of the
malfunction. The data may assist in identifying the
cause of the malfunction, and in judging whether it
was temporary or not.
