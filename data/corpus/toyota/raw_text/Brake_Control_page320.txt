BC–309
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
FAIL-SAFE CHART
1. FAIL SAFE OPERATION
(a) If there is a problem with sensor signals or actuator
systems, the skid control ECU prohibits power
supply to the brake actuator assembly and informs
the ECM of the VSC system failure.
(b) The brake actuator assembly turns off each
solenoid and the ECM shuts off the VSC control
(traction control signal) from the skid control ECU
accordingly, which turns out to be as if the vehicle
stability control system was not installed.
(c) ABS, VSC, and TRAC control will be prohibited, but
EBD control continues as much as possible. If EBD
control is impossible, the brake warning light comes
on to warn the driver (See page BC-298).
Malfunction Symptom
ABS system Prohibits the ABS, BA, TRAC, and VSC control
BC
BA system Prohibits the ABS, BA, TRAC, and VSC control
EBD system Prohibits the ABS, EBD, BA, TRAC, and VSC control
TRAC system Prohibits the TRAC and VSC control
VSC system Prohibits the TRAC and VSC control
HINT:
• A malfunction in either the ABS or BA system
results in an identical operation, with ABS, BA,
TRAC, and VSC system control prohibited.
• If control is prohibited due to a malfunction during
operation, control will be disabled gradually to
prevent the vehicle from becoming unstable
suddenly.
