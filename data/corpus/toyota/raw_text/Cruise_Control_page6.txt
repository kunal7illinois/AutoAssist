CRUISE CONTROL – CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM
3. OPERATION OF CRUISE CONTROL
The cruise control main switch operates 7 functions:
SET, - (COAST), TAP-DOWN, RES (RESUME), +
(ACCEL), TAP-UP, and CANCEL. The SET, TAP-DOWN,
and - (COAST) functions, and the RES (RESUME), TAP-
UP, and + (ACCEL) functions are operated with the
same switch. The cruise control main switch is an
automatic return type switch which turns on only while
operating it in the direction of each arrow and turns off
after releasing it.
(a) SET CONTROL
The vehicle speed is stored and constant speed
control is maintained when pushing the cruise
control main switch to - (COAST)/SET while driving
with the main switch on (the CRUISE main indicator
light is on), and the vehicle speed is within the set
speed range (between the low and high speed
limits).
(b) - (COAST) CONTROL
When the cruise control main switch is set to -
(COAST)/SET and held in that position while the
cruise control system is operating, the ECM sends a
"throttle valve opening angle 0°" demand signal to
the cruise control system. Then the vehicle speed,
when the cruise control main switch is released, is
stored and maintained.
HINT:
An actual throttle valve opening angle of 0° is not
possible due to the idle speed control, etc.
(c) TAP-DOWN CONTROL
When tapping down the cruise control main switch
to - (COAST)/SET (for approximately 0.6 seconds)
while the cruise control system is in operation, the
stored vehicle speed decreases each time by
approximately 1.6 km/h (1.0 mph). When the cruise
control main switch is released from - (COAST)/SET
CC
and the difference between the driving and stored
vehicle speed is more than 5 km/h (3 mph), the
driving vehicle speed is stored and constant speed
control is maintained.
(d) ACCELERATION CONTROL
The throttle valve motor of the throttle body
assembly is instructed by the ECM to open the
throttle valve when + (ACCEL)/RES (RESUME) on
the cruise control main switch is pressed and held
while the cruise control system is in operation.
When the cruise control main switch is released
from + (ACCEL)/RES (RESUME), the vehicle speed
is stored and the vehicle is controlled at a constant
speed.
