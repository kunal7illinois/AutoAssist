2AZ-FE EMISSION CONTROL – HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR
REMOVAL
1. DISCONNECT CABLE FROM NEGATIVE BATTERY
TERMINAL
CAUTION:
Wait at least 90 seconds after disconnecting the
cable from the negative (-) battery terminal to
prevent airbag and seat belt pretensioner activation.
2. REMOVE HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR (for Bank 1
Sensor 2)
(a) Disconnect the sensor connector.
(b) Using SST, remove the sensor from the front
exhaust pipe.
