2. ACTIVE TEST
HINT:
Performing the ACTIVE TEST using the intelligent tester
allows the relay, actuator and other items to operate
without removing any parts. Performing the ACTIVE
TEST as a first step in troubleshooting is one of the
methods to save labor time.
It is possible to display the DATA LIST during the
ACTIVE TEST.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
