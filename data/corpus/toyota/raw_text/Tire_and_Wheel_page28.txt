TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. CHECK BATTERY VOLTAGE
Standard voltage:
11 to 14 V
If the voltage is below 11 V, recharge the battery before
proceeding.
2. CHECK DLC3
(a) The ECU uses the ISO 15765-4 for communication
CG SG CANH SIL protocol. The terminal arrangement of the DLC3
complies with SAE J1962 and matches the ISO
15765-4 format.

NOTICE:
*Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the power switch, or any other switches
or the doors.
(b) If the result is not as specified, DLC3 may have a
malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to DLC3,
turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to use
the tester. If the display indicates that a
communication error has occurred, there is a
problem either with the vehicle or with the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect DLC3 of
the original vehicle.
• If communication is still not possible when the
tester is connected to another vehicle, the
problem may be in the tester itself. Consult the
Service Department listed in the tester's
instruction manual.
