2GR-FE FUEL – FUEL INJECTOR
INSPECTION
1. INSPECT FUEL INJECTOR ASSEMBLY
(a) Inspect injector resistance.
(1) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
between the terminals.
Resistance:
11.6 to 12.4 Ω at 20°C (68°F)
If the resistance is not as specified, replace the
injector.
(b) Inspect the injection volume.
CAUTION:
This test involves high-pressure fuel and
electricity. Take every precaution regarding safe
handling of both the fuel and the electricity.
Perform this test in a safe area, and avoid any
sparks or flames. Do not smoke.
(1) Install the fuel tube connector to SST (hose),
SST (Tube Connector) Fuel Tube then connect the tube connector to the fuel
pipe (vehicle side).

(Clamp) CAUTION:
Install a suitable vinyl tube onto the injector
Vinyl Tube to contain gasoline spray.
(5) Operate the fuel pump (See page FU-8).

(6) Connect SST (wire) to the injector and the
battery for 15 seconds, and measure the
injection volume with the graduated cylinder.
Test each injector 2 or 3 times.

If the injection volume is not as specified,
replace the injector.
