BODY ELECTRICAL - SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM BE-143
2. Dual-stage SRS Airbag System
General
In this system, when the front airbag sensors and airbag sensor assembly detect a front collision, the airbag
sensor assembly judges the extent of impact, seat position and whether or not the seat belts are fastened,
thus optimizing the airbag inflating output by delaying the inflation timing of the 2nd initiator and the 1st
initiator.
Seat Position Sensor
1) General
The seat position sensor is mounted on the upper rail portion of the driver seat rail, and includes a Hall
IC and a magnet. This sensor is used to detect the sliding position of the driver seat.

2) Operation
When the seat is in the rearward position, the lower rail portion of the seat rail is close to the seat position
sensor. When it is in the forward position, the distance between the lower rail portion and the sensor
becomes larger.
Thus, the magnetic flux of the magnet inside the seat position sensor varies depending on the seat
position. The Hall IC detects this variation and outputs signals to the airbag sensor assembly.
