INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• The following troubleshooting flowchart is based on the premise that the engine is cranked normally. If
the engine does not crank, proceed to the problem symptoms table (See page ES-33).
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 READ VALUE OF INTELLIGENT TESTER (STARTER SIGNAL)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) and turn the tester on.
