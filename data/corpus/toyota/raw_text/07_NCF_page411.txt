BODY ELECTRICAL - POWER WINDOW SYSTEM BE-77
Service Tip
The power window motor assembly stores the initial position of each door window. The memory is
not cleared if battery terminals, fuses or power window motor connectors are disconnected. However,
after the power window motor assembly and power window regulator assembly are replaced, the
stored initial position data must be cleared and the initialization of the power window motor assembly
must be performed. When necessary, perform the initialization as follows:
Initial Position Memory Erasure Procedure
(cid:3) Turn the power supply off (for example, remove a power window motor connector or fuse) while
