HINT:
• *1: Neutral
• *2: If the shift solenoid SLT is stuck on, the line
pressure will be low. Therefore, the amount of torque
that can be transmitted by each gear is lower than the
normal limit. When the engine power exceeds this
lowered limit, the engine speed will increase freely.
• *3: When shift solenoid SLT is stuck OFF, gear
shifting is normal.
