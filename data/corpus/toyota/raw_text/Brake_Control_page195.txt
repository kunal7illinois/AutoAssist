(a) Reconnect the skid control ECU connector.
(b) Clear the DTC (See page BC-141).
(c) Start the engine.
(d) Drive the vehicle at the speed of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more.
(e) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-141).

DTCs (C0278/11 and/or C0279/12) are not output A
DTCs (C0278/11 and/or C0279/12) are output B
HINT:
• If a speed signal of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more is input to
the skid control ECU, with the ignition switch on (IG)
and the stop light switch off, the ECU performs self
diagnosis of the motor and solenoid circuits.
• If the normal system code is output (the trouble code
is not output), slightly jiggle the connectors, wire
harnesses, and fuses of the brake actuator assembly.
Make sure that no DTCs are output.
