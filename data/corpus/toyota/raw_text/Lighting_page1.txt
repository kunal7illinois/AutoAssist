PRECAUTION
1. PRECAUTION FOR USING BATTERY DURING
INSPECTION
(a) While using the battery during inspection, do not
bring the positive and negative tester probes too
close to each other as a short circuit may occur.
2. PRECAUTION FOR HEADLIGHT BULB
REPLACEMENT
(a) If even a thin film of oil is left on the surface of the
halogen light, the bulb may be damaged because
the light will burn at a higher temperature.
(b) Handle any halogen light with great care. Dropping,
hitting or damaging the bulb, in any way, may result
in exploding and shattering because the internal
pressure is high.
(c) Always prepare a new bulb for immediate
replacement. While replacing the bulb, the lens may
attract dust and moisture if removed from the
vehicle for too long.
(d) Always use a bulb of the same wattage for
replacement.
(e) Firmly reinstall the socket after bulb replacement.
The lens may become cloudy or the light cavity may
fill with water through the gaps around the socket.
