• Switch off all accessories and air
conditioning before connecting the
intelligent tester.
HINT:
Refer to the intelligent tester operator's manual
for further details.
(c) When not using the intelligent tester:
Check the idle speed.
(1) Using SST, connect the tachometer test probe
DLC3
to terminal 9 (TAC) of the DLC3.

9. INSPECT COMPRESSION
A122830E15 (a) Warm up and stop the engine.
(b) Disconnect the injector connectors.
(c) Remove the intake air surge tank (See page FU- EM
13).
(d) Remove the 6 ignition coils.
(e) Remove the 6 spark plugs.
(f) Check the cylinder compression pressure.
(1) Insert a compression gauge into the spark plug
hole.
(2) While cranking the engine, measure the
compression pressure.
Compression pressure:
1.4 MPa (14 kgf/cm2, 199 psi)
Minimum pressure:
0.98 MPa (10 kgf/cm2, 142 psi)
A129621 Difference between each cylinder:
0.1 MPa (1.0 kgf/cm2, 15 psi)
NOTICE:
• Always use a fully charged battery to
obtain an engine speed of 250 rpm or
more.
• Check the other cylinders' compression
pressure in the same way.
• This measurement must be done as
quickly as possible.
(3) If the cylinder compression is low, pour a small
amount of engine oil into the cylinder through
the spark plug hole and inspect again.
HINT:
• If adding oil increases the compression, the
piston rings and/or cylinder bore may be
worn or damaged.
• If pressure stays low, a valve may be stuck
or seated improperly, or there may be
leakage in the gasket.
(g) Install the 6 spark plugs.
