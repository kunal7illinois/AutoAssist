TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
DTC C2141/41 Transmitter ID1 Error
DTC C2142/42 Transmitter ID2 Error
DTC C2143/43 Transmitter ID3 Error
DTC C2144/44 Transmitter ID4 Error
DTC C2145/45 Transmitter ID5 Error
DESCRIPTION
The tire pressure warning valve and transmitters that are installed in the tire and wheel assemblies
measure the air pressure of the tires. The measured values are transmitted to the tire pressure warning
TW antenna and receiver on the body as radio waves and then sent to the tire pressure warning ECU. The
ECU compares the measured air pressure values with the air pressure threshold. When the measured air
pressure value is less than this threshold, the warning light in the combination meter comes on.
When the internal circuit of the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is malfunctioning, this DTC is
output.
DTC No. DTC Detecting Condition Trouble Area
If an "ERROR" signal is received 3 times consecutively,
the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter will be
C2141/41 judged as defective and a DTC will be output.
C2142/42 This will happen in situations where the inflation pressure
• Tire pressure warning valve and transmitter
C2143/43 is outside the range 0 to 637.5 kPa (0 to 6.48 kgf/cm2, 0
• Tire pressure warning ECU
C2144/44 psi to 92.2 psi), the temperature inside the tire is outside
C2145/45 the specified range -40 to 120°C (-40 to 253°F), or an
error occurs in the tire pressure warning valve and
transmitter or the surrounding area.
HINT:
• It is necessary to perform the procedure to identify the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter that
is malfunctioning because it cannot be identified by the output DTC.
• DTC 2145/45 is used only when the vehicle is equipped with ground spare tire.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
NOTICE:
• When replacing the tire pressure warning ECU, read the IDs stored in the ECU using the
intelligent tester and write them down before removal.
• It is necessary to perform initialization (See page TW-18) after registration (See page TW-15) of
the transmitter IDs into the tire pressure warning ECU after the ECU and/or valve and
transmitter has been replaced.
