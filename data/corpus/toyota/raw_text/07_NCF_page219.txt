(cid:3) In order to provide a hydraulic pressure that is proportional to the current that flows to the solenoid coil,
solenoid valves SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, SLU and SLT linearly control the line pressure and clutch and brake
engagement pressure based on the signals from the ECT ECU.
(cid:3) Solenoid valves SL1, SL2, SL3 and SL4 are large flow linear solenoid valves that can supply more
pressure than conventional ones. These solenoid valves control engagement elements by directly
regulating the line pressure without using the pressure regulation valve (control valve) or the pressure
reduction valve (solenoid modulator valve). Thus, the number of valves and the length of the valve body
fluid passage have been reduced, the shifting response has been increased and the shift shock has been
minimized.
