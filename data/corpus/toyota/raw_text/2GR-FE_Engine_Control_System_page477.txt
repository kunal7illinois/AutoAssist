2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
3 CHECK HARNESS AND CONNECTOR (VSV FOR AICV - ECM, VSV FOR AICV - EFI
RELAY)
(a) Check the wire harness between the VSV for AICV
Wire Harness Side: connector and the ECM connector.
(1) Disconnect the A53 VSV for AICV connector.
(2) Disconnect the A55 ECM connector.
(3) Measure the resistance between the terminals of
AICV VSV
the wire harness side connectors and body ground.
Standard resistance (Check for open)
Tester Connection Specified Condition
A53 1 2
VSV for AICV (A53-2) - AICV (A55-4) Below 1 Ω
Standard resistance (Check for short) ES
Tester Connection Specified Condition
VSV for AICV (A53-2) or AICV (A55-4) - Body
Engine Room Junction Block 10 kΩ or higher
ground
(4) Reconnect the ECM connector.
(b) Check the EFI No. 3 fuse.
(1) Remove the EFI No. 3 fuse from the engine room R/
B.
(2) Measure the resistance EFI No. 3 fuse.
Standard resistance:
Below 1 Ω
1E
(3) Reinstall the EFI No. 3 fuse.
(c) Check the wire harness between the VSV for AICV and
the EFI relay.
(1) Remove the engine room junction block from the
engine room R/B.
(2) Measure the resistance between the terminals of
the wire harness side connectors.
Standard resistance (Check for open)
Tester Connection Specified Condition
VSV for AICV (A53-1) - 1E-6 Below 1 Ω
(3) Reconnect the VSV for AICV connector.
(4) Reinstall the engine room junction block.
