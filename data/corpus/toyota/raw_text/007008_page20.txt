(d) Subtract the piston pin diameter measurement from
Piston Pin Bore Diameter Mark the piston pin bore diameter measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
0.001 to 0.007 mm (0.00004 to 0.0003 in.)
Maximum oil clearance:
0.013 mm (0.0005 in.)
If the oil clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the connecting rod. If necessary, replace
the piston and piston pin as a set.
Front Mark (e) Subtract the piston pin diameter measurement from
the connecting rod small end bore diameter
measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
Connecting Rod 0.005 to 0.011 mm (0.0002 to 0.0004 in.)
Small End Bore Maximum oil clearance:
Diameter Mark Front Mark
0.017 mm (0.0007 in.)
EM If the oil clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the connecting rod. If necessary, replace
the connecting rod and piston pin as a set.

8. INSPECT CONNECTING ROD SUB-ASSEMBLY
(a) Using a connecting rod aligner and feeler gauge,
check the connecting rod alignment.
(1) Check for misalignment.
Maximum misalignment:
0.05 mm (0.0020 in.) per 100 mm (3.94 in.)
If the misalignment is greater than the
maximum, replace the connecting rod.

(2) Check for twist.
Maximum twist:
0.15 mm (0.0059 in.) per 100 mm (3.94 in.)
If the twist is greater than the maximum,
replace the connecting rod.

9. INSPECT CONNECTING ROD BOLT
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the tension portion
diameter of the bolt.
Standard diameter:
7.2 to 7.3 mm (0.283 to 0.287 in.)
Maximum diameter:
7.0 mm (0.276 in.)
If the diameter is less than the minimum, replace the
connecting rod bolt.
