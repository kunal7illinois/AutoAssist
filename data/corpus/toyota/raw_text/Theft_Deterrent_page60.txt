NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
TD (b) Connect the cable of the intelligent tester (with CAN
VIM) to the DLC3, turn the ignition switch ON and
attempt to use the intelligent tester. If the screen
displays a communication error message, a
problem exists in the vehicle or in the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tool is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
on the original vehicle.
• If communication is still impossible when the tool
is connected to another vehicle, the problem is
probably in the tool itself. Consult the Service
Department listed in the tool's instruction manual.
