CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-99
3) Brake Assist Condition (Operation Rod Speed > Power Piston Speed)
When the operation rod speed is faster than the power piston speed, the air valve pushes the slide valve
hook. Consequently, the slide valve separates from the slide valve hook, the spring pushes the control
valve, and the control valve closes. Thus, the opening of the air valve becomes enlarged and the air
volume that is introduced increases. This results in a brake assist force to powerfully push the power
piston.
