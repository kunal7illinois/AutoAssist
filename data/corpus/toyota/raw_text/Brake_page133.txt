BC–127
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
If the vehicle is equipped with a multi information
display, and the vehicle stores a DTC, the master
caution indicator light will illuminate, and the multi
information display will indicate the malfunction
instead of the VSC warning light. In this case, the
ABS warning, BRAKE warning, and SLIP indicator
lights will also come on.
If the indicator remains on or does not come on,
proceed to troubleshooting for the light circuits listed
below.

2. SENSOR CHECK USING TEST MODE (SIGNAL
CHECK) (INTELLIGENT TESTER)
BC
NOTICE:
After replacement of the brake actuator assembly
and/or yaw rate and acceleration sensor, perform
zero point calibration of the yaw rate and
acceleration sensor.
HINT:
• If the ignition switch is turned from on (IG) to on
(ACC) or off during Test Mode (signal check), DTCs of
the signal check function will be erased.
• During Test Mode (signal check), the skid control ECU
records all DTCs of the signal check function. By
performing the Test Mode (signal check), the codes
are erased if a normal condition is confirmed. The
remaining codes are the codes where an abnormality
was found.
(a) Procedure to enter Test Mode.
(1) Turn the ignition switch off.
(2) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(3) Check that the steering wheel is centered and
move the shift lever to the P position (A/T) or
apply the parking brake (M/T).
(4) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
