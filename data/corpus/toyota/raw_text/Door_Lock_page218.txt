DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
CG SG CANH SIL 1. CHECK DLC3
(a) The vehicle's ECU uses ISO 15765-4 for
communication protocol. The terminal arrangement
of the DLC3 complies with SAE J1962 and matches
the ISO 15765-4 format.

NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
