– Driver Airbag
– Front Passenger Airbag
– Knee Airbag
– Seat Belt Pretensioner
∗ The system reaches an ignition judgment to deploy the following device based on the signals received from the side
airbag sensors.
– Side Airbags

∗ The dual–stage SRS airbag system has been used for the driver and front passenger airbags. This system controls the
optimal airbag inflation by judging the extent of impact, seat position (driver seat) and whether or not the seat belt is
fastened(driver seat) and infomation from the Front Passenger Occupant Classification System.
∗ The front passenger occupant classification system judges whether the front passenger seat is occupied by an adult or
child (with child seat) or is unoccupied, according to the load applied to the front passenger seat and whether the seat belt
is buckled. Based on the results, it restricts the deployment of the front passenger airbag, front passenger side airbag, and
front passenger seat belt pretensioner. In addition, the system informs the driver of the result of the judgment through the
use of the AIRBAG ON/OFF indicator lights.
