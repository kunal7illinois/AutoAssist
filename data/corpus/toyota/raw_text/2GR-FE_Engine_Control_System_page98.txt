HINT:
DTC P0011, P0012, P0021 or P0022 is output when
foreign objects in engine oil are caught in some parts of
the system. These codes will stay output even if the
system returns to normal after a short time. These
foreign objects are then captured by the oil filter, thus
eliminating the source of the problem.
