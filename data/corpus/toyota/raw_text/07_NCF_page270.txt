3. Outline of EBD Control Function
The detailed outline is the same as that of brake control system (ABS with EBD). For details, see page CH-94.
4. Outline of Brake Assist System
(cid:3) The brake assist system in combination with ABS helping improves the vehicle’s brake performance.
(cid:3) The brake assist system interprets a quick push of the brake pedal as emergency braking and supplements
the brake power applied if the driver has not stepped hard enough on the brake pedal. In emergencies,
driver, especially inexperienced ones, often panic and do not apply sufficient pressure on the brake pedal.
(cid:3) A key feature of brake assist system is that the timing and the degree of braking assistance are designed
to help ensure that the driver does not discern anything unusual about the braking operation. When the
driver intentionally eases up on the brake pedal, the system reduces the amount of assistance it provides.
(cid:3) Based on the signals from the master cylinder pressure sensor, the skid control ECU calculates the speed
and the amount of the brake pedal application and then determines the intention of the driver to make an
emergency braking. If the skid control ECU determines that the driver intends the emergency braking, the
system activates the brake actuator to increase the brake fluid pressure, which increases the braking force.
(cid:1) In case that the driver’s depressing force is small when applying emergency braking (cid:2)
