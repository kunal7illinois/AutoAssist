DTC P0724 Brake Switch "B" Circuit High
DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this circuit is to prevent the engine from stalling while driving in the lock-up condition when
the brakes are suddenly applied.
When the brake pedal is depressed, this switch sends a signal to the ECM. Then the ECM cancels the
operation of the lock-up clutch while braking is in progress.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
This DTC indicates that the stop light switch remains ON. When the stop light switch remains ON during
GO and STOP driving, the ECM interprets this as a fault in the stop light switch. Then the MIL illuminates
and the ECM stores the DTC. The vehicle must GO (30 km/h (18.63 mph) or more) and STOP (less than
3 km/h (1.86 mph)) 5 times for 2 driving cycles in order for the DTC to be output.
