(cid:3)LIGHT TURN-OFF SYSTEM
(cid:3) The light turn-off system is used to prevent the driver from leaving the vehicle with the exterior lights
(headlights, fog lights, parking lights, taillights and license plate lights) ON.
(cid:3) If the pwer source* is turned OFF and any door is opened and all doors (including the luggage
compartment door) are closed with all exterior lights ON, this system turns them OFF approximately 30
seconds after door closure. However, with all the doors locked, when the lock button on the wireless
remote control is pushed, the exterior lights are turned OFF immediately.
(cid:3) When the power source* is turned OFF and the driver’s door is opened with the exterior lights except
headlights ON, this system turns them OFF.
*: The power source condition can be changed by operating the engine switch on models with the smart key
system, and the ignition switch on models without the smart key system.
