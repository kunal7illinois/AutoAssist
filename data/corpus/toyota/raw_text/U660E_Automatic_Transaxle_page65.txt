U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
2 INSPECT ATF TEMPERATURE SENSOR
(a) Disconnect the ATF temperature sensor connector from
the transmission wire.
(b) Measure the resistance according to the value(s) in the AX
table below.
Standard resistance
Tester Connection Specified Condition
E2 - THO1 90 Ω to 156 kΩ
E2 - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
THO1 - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
THO1 E2
HINT:
If the resistance is out of the specified range with the
ATF temperature shown in the table below, the
driveability of the vehicle may decrease.
Standard resistance
ATF Temperature Specified Condition
10 °C (50°F) 5.8 to 7.1 kΩ
110°C (230°F) 0.22 to 0.28 kΩ
