8. Air Intake Control System
General
The system has a dual path design for air intake. An air intake control valve and actuator control the air flow
path.
As a result, a reduction in intake noise in the low-speed range and an increase in the power output in the
high-speed range is realized.

Operation
(cid:3) When the engine is operating in the low- to mid-speed range, this control operates the air intake control
valve to close one side of the air cleaner inlet. As a result, the intake area has been minimized and the
intake noise is reduced.
(cid:3) When the engine is operating in the high-speed range, this control operates the air intake control valve
to open both sides of the air cleaner inlet. As a result, the intake area has been maximized and the intake
efficiency is improved.
