ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-123
Construction
1) VVT-i Controller
(cid:3) This controller consists of the housing driven from the timing chain and the vane coupled with the
intake and exhaust camshafts.
(cid:3) The intake side has used a VVT-i controller with 3 vanes, and the exhaust side has used one with 4
vanes.
(cid:3) When the engine stops, the intake side VVT-i controller is locked on the most retarded angle side by
the lock pin, and the exhaust side controller is locked on the most advanced angle side. This ensures
excellent engine startability.
(cid:3) The oil pressure sent from the advance or retard side path at the intake and exhaust camshaft causes
rotation in the VVT-i controller vane circumferential direction to vary the intake valve timing
continuously.
(cid:3) An advanced angle assist spring is provided on the exhaust side VVT-i controller. This helps to apply
torque in the advanced angle direction so that the vane lock pin securely engages with the housing
when the engine stops.
