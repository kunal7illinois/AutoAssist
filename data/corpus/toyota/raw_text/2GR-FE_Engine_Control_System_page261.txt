Lean:
During A/F CONTROL, the A/F sensor (AFS) output
voltage is consistently more than 3.35 V, and the HO2
sensor output voltage (O2S) is consistently less than
0.4 V.
Rich:
During A/F CONTROL, the AFS is consistently less
than 3.0 V, and the O2S is consistently more than
0.55 V.
Lean/Rich:
During A/F CONTROL of the ACTIVE TEST, the
output voltage of the HO2 sensor alternates correctly.
