INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• Refer to inspection procedure for CAN communication system (See page CA-8).
• If the CAN communication malfunctions, the TCM cannot receive the current data from the ECM. In
this case, the freeze frame data output from the TCM has not been updated, so the data will not be
useful for the inspection. However, reading the Data List as the first step in troubleshooting is effective
to find malfunctions.
• The malfunction area can be checked using the BUS CHECK function on the intelligent tester (See
page CA-25).
