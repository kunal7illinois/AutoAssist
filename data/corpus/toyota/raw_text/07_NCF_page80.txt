ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-53
Construction
1) VVT-i Controller
(cid:1) This controller consists of the housing driven from the timing chain and the vane coupled with the
intake camshaft.
(cid:1) The oil pressure sent from the advance or retard side path at the intake camshaft causes rotation in the
VVT-i- controller vane circumferential direction to vary the intake valve timing continuously.
When the engine is stopped, the intake camshaft will be in the most retarded state to ensure startability.
When hydraulic pressure is not applied to the VVT-i controller immediately after the engine has been
started, the lock pin locks the movement of the VVT-i controller to prevent a knocking noise.

2) Camshaft Timing Oil Control Valve
The camshaft timing oil control valve controls the spool valve position in accordance with the duty
control from the ECM thus allocating the hydraulic pressure that is applied to the VVT-i controller to the
advance and the retard side. When the engine is stopped, the camshaft timing oil control valve is in the
most retarded state.
