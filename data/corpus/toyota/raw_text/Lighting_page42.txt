LIGHTING – LIGHTING SYSTEM
Headlight (HI-BEAM) Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The main body ECU receives dimmer switch HIGH signal and light control switch HEAD signal from the
headlight dimmer switch assembly, and turns the high beam headlights on.
HINT:
When a short circuit occurs between the power distributor (engine room J/B assembly) and high beam
headlight, the power distributor stops the DRL relay operation (Fail-safe function).
