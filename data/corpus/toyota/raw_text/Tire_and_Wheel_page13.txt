TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
4. TIRE PRESSURE WARNING RESET SWITCH
• By operating the tire pressure warning reset switch,
the tire pressure warning ECU can be set to issue a
warning at an inflation pressure that corresponds to
the type of tires.
Therefore, the dealer must set the warning threshold
to the proper value in order to comply with the local
regulations.
• Operate the tire pressure warning reset switch only
after the inflation pressures of all tires (including the
full-size spare tire) have been adjusted on the vehicle.
• To initialize the system, press and hold the tire
pressure warning reset switch for 3 seconds or longer
with the ignition switch on (IG). After the initialization
process has started, the warning light blinks 3 times
(1 second on, 1 second off).
• During initialization, the tire pressure warning valve TW
and transmitter measures the inflation pressure of the
tires, and registers the signals that are transmitted
into the tire pressure warning ECU at a frequency of
once per minute. The initialization process is
completed when signals from the all tires (including
the ground spare tire) have been received.
