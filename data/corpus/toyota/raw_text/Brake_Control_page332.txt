BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
3 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL WAVEFORM
(a) Lift up the vehicle.
(b) Perform the inspection using an oscilloscope.
(1) Disconnect the front speed sensor connector.
(2) Connect the oscilloscope to terminals 1 and 2 of the
front speed sensor.

(3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
OK:
The same waveform is output from front
wheels and there is no noise or interference in
the waveform.
FL+ FL- FR+ FR- HINT:
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
Normal Signal Waveform:
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
and the output voltage becomes greater.

• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign

matter attached to the speed sensor.
(4) Connect the connector.

4 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Clear the DTCs (See page BC-302).
(b) Drive the vehicle at a speed of approximately 25 mph (40
km/h) or more for 60 seconds or more.
(c) Check if the same DTCs are recorded (See page BC-
302).
HINT:
Reinstall the sensors, connectors, etc. and restore the
vehicle to its prior condition before rechecking for DTCs.
