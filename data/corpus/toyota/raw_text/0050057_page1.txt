HINT:
The leak detection pump is built into the canister pump module.
DESCRIPTION
The description can be found in the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) System (see page ES-335).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
Refer to the EVAP System (see page ES-340).
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
5 hours* after the ignition switch is turned OFF, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure
(vacuum) in the EVAP system. The ECM monitors for leaks and actuator malfunctions based on the EVAP
pressure.
HINT:
*: If the engine coolant temperature is not below 35°C (95°F) 5 hours after the ignition switch is turned
OFF, the monitor check starts 2 hours later. If it is still not below 35°C (95°F) 7 hours after the ignition
switch is turned to OFF, the monitor check starts 2.5 hours later.
