2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
4. Vacuum introduction
Next sequence run if following condition set -
EVAP pressure Saturated within 15 minutes
5. Purge VSV stuck closed check
Next sequence run if following condition set -
EVAP pressure change after purge VSV ON (open) 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g) or more
6. Second reference pressure measurement
Next sequence run if all of following conditions set Condition 1, 2, 3 and 4
1. EVAP pressure just after reference pressure -1 kPa-g (-7.5 mmHg-g) or less
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.057 kPa-g (-36.4 to -7.93 mmHg-g)
3. Reference pressure Saturated within 60 seconds
ES
4. Reference pressure difference between first and second Less than 0.7 kPa-g (5.25 mmHg-g)
7. Leak check
Next sequence run if following condition set -
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction complete Second reference pressure or less
8. Atmospheric pressure measurement
EVAP monitor complete if following condition set -
Atmospheric pressure difference between sequence 1 and 8 Within 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g)
Typical Malfunction Thresholds
Purge VSV stuck open: -
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction complete Higher than reference pressure x 0.2
Purge VSV stuck closed: -
EVAP pressure change after purge VSV ON (open) Less than 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g)
