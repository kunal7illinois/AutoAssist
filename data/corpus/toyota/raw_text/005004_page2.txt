2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(b) If the test value is between the minimum and
maximum test limits, the component is functioning
normally. If not, the component is malfunctioning.
The test value is usually not near the test limits. If
the test value is near the test limits, the component
is likely to malfunction in the near future.
HINT:
The monitor result might on rare occasions be
PASS even if the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) is
illuminated. This indicates the system malfunctioned
on a previous driving cycle. This might be caused by
an intermittent problem.

Misfire
Monitor ID Test ID Scaling Unit Description
Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) misfire for all
cylinders:
$A1 $0B Multiply by 1 Time EWMA = Total misfire counts for last driving cycle * 0.1 + Last
EWMA * 0.9
Misfire counts for last 10 driving cycles - Total
Ignition switch ON: Total misfire counts for last driving cycle
$A1 $0C Multiply by 1 Time Engine running: Total misfire counts for current driving cycle
Misfire counts for last or current driving cycle - all cylinders
