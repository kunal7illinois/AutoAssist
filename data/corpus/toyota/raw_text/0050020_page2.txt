2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
HINT:
When any of these DTCs are set, check the IAT by selecting the following menu items on the intelligent
tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / INTAKE AIR.
Temperature Displayed Malfunctions
-40°C (-40°F) Open circuit
140°C (284°F) or higher Short circuit
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM monitors the sensor voltage and uses this value to calculate the IAT. When the sensor output
voltage deviates from the normal operating range, the ECM interprets this as a malfunction in the IAT
sensor and sets a DTC.
Example:
ES
If the sensor output voltage is more than 4.91 V for 0.5 seconds or more, the ECM determines that there
is an open in the IAT sensor circuit, and sets DTC P0113. Conversely, if the output voltage is less than
0.18 V for 0.5 seconds or more, the ECM determines that there is a short in the sensor circuit, and sets
DTC P0112.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 0.5 seconds after the engine is next started.
MONITOR STRATEGY
P0110: IAT sensor range check (Fluctuating)
Related DTCs P0112: IAT sensor range check (Low voltage)
P0113: IAT sensor range check (High voltage)
