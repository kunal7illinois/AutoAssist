INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 CHECK OPERATION OF SPEEDOMETER
(a) Drive the vehicle and check whether the operation of the
speedometer in the combination meter is normal.
HINT:
• The vehicle speed sensor is operating normally if the
speedometer reading is normal.
