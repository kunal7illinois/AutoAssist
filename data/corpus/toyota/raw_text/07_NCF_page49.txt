EG-22 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
6. Exhaust Manifold (California Package Model)
A compact exhaust manifold with a double-wall construction is used. This manifold has been shaped to
prevent the temperature of the exhaust gas from dropping as it travels from the exhaust port to the TWC
(Three-Way Catalytic converter). This promotes the activation of the TWC.
Furthermore, this manifold has been shaped so that the air-fuel ratio sensor can be mounted in the most
effective position for detecting the exhaust gas.

7. Exhaust Manifold (Except California Package Model)
(cid:1) A stainless steel exhaust manifold is used for improving the warm-up of TWC and for weight reduction.
(cid:1) The air fuel ratio sensor is used to the exhaust manifold.
(cid:1) A ceramic type TWC is used. This TWC improves exhaust emissions by optimizing the cell density.
