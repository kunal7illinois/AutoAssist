CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-95
3. Outline of Brake Assist System (Mechanical Type)
(cid:3) The brake assist system in combination with ABS helps improve the vehicle’s brake performance.
(cid:3) The brake assist system interprets a quick push of the brake pedal as emergency braking and supplements
the brake power applied if the driver has not stepped hard enough on the brake pedal. In emergencies, the
driver, especially inexperienced ones, often panic and do not apply sufficient pressure on the brake pedal.
(cid:3) A key feature of brake assist system is that the timing and the degree of braking assistance are designed
to ensure that the driver does not discern anything unusual about the braking operation.
When the driver intentionally eases up on the brake pedal, the system reduces the amount of assistance
it provides.
(cid:3) The mechanical type brake assist uses the brake assist mechanism in the brake booster to mechanically
activate the brake booster function in order to increase the brake force. For details, see page CH-98.
(cid:1) In case that the driver’s depressing force is small when applying emergency braking (cid:2)
The fluid pressure is increased
