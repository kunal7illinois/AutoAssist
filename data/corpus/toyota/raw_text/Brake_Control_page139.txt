BC–129
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
(b) Check that the ABS warning light stays on for 3
seconds.
HINT:
• Ensure that the ABS warning light comes on.
• While the ABS warning light stays on, continue to
depress the brake pedal with a force of 98 N (10
kgf, 22 lbf) or more.
• The ABS warning light comes on for 3 seconds
every time brake pedal operation above is
performed.
• If the check of the master cylinder pressure
sensor is not completed, depressing the brake
pedal causes further decrease in the negative
pressure, making the sensor check difficult to be
completed.
• If the negative pressure is insufficient, the master
cylinder pressure sensor check may not be
completed. In this case, run the engine at idle to
obtain sufficient negative pressure. BC
• If the brake pedal is strongly depressed when the
negative pressure is insufficient, the BRAKE
warning light may come on in accordance with
the booster pressure control. In this case, run the
engine at idle to obtain sufficient negative
pressure.
5. SPEED SENSOR CHECK (INTELLIGENT TESTER)
(a) Check the speed sensor signal.
(1) Drive the vehicle straight ahead.
Accelerate the vehicle to a speed of 28 mph (45
km/h) or more for several seconds and check
that the ABS warning light goes off.
HINT:
The sensor check may not be completed if
wheelspin occurs.
(b) Stop the vehicle.
NOTICE:
• Before performing the speed sensor check,
complete the acceleration sensor and master
cylinder pressure sensor checks.
• The speed sensor check may not be
completed if the speed sensor check is
started while turning the steering wheel or
spinning the wheels.
• After the ABS warning light goes off and if the
vehicle speed exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h), a
signal check code will be stored again.
Accelerate or stop the vehicle before the
speed reaches 50 mph (80 km/h).
• If the signal check has not been completed,
the ABS warning light blinks while driving
and the ABS system does not operate.
