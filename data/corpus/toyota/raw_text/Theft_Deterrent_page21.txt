THEFT DETERRENT – THEFT DETERRENT SYSTEM (w/ Smart Key System)
(b) Connect the cable of the intelligent tester (with CAN
VIM) to the DLC3, turn the engine switch on (IG)
and attempt to use the intelligent tester. If the
screen displays a communication error message, a
problem exists in the vehicle or in the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tool is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
on the original vehicle.
• If communication is still impossible when the tool
is connected to another vehicle, the problem is
probably in the tool itself. Consult the Service
Department listed in the tool's instruction manual.
