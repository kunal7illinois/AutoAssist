NOTICE:
Do not reconnect the disconnected connectors until
this inspection is complete because there may be a
short in 2 or more branch wires.
Result
Symptom Proceed to
The resistance is still below 54 Ω when all the specified connectors are disconnected. (There
A
are no shorts in the branch wires.)
The resistance becomes normal (between 54 and 69 Ω) when a connector is disconnected.
B
(There is a short in one or more of the branch wires.)
(d) When there is a short in one or more of the branch wires:
(1) Reconnect all of the connectors to the No. 1 CAN J/
C, except for the one that was disconnected last
(the short-circuited bus wire). Check that the
resistance shown on the tester is normal (between
54 and 69 Ω) to confirm that there is a short in one
branch wire only.
