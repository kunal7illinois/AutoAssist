Throttle / Pedal Position Sensor / Switch "D"
DTC P2121
Circuit Range / Performance
DESCRIPTION
This ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System) does not use a throttle cable.
The Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor is mounted on the accelerator pedal bracket and has 2
sensor circuits: VPA (main) and VPA2 (sub). This sensor is a non-contact type, and uses Hall-effect
elements, in order to yield accurate signals, even in extreme driving conditions, such as at high speeds as
well as very low speeds. The voltage, which is applied to terminals VPA and VPA2 of the ECM, varies
between 0 V and 5 V in proportion to the operating angle of the accelerator pedal (throttle valve). A signal
from VPA indicates the actual accelerator pedal opening angle (throttle valve opening angle) and is used
for engine control. A signal from VPA2 conveys the status of the VPA circuit and is used to check the APP
sensor itself.
The ECM monitors the actual accelerator pedal opening angle (throttle valve opening angle) through the ES
signals from VPA and VPA2, and controls the throttle actuator according to these signals.
