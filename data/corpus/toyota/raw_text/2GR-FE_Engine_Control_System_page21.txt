CHECK FOR INTERMITTENT
PROBLEMS
HINT:
Inspect the vehicle's ECM using check mode. Intermittent
problems are easier to detect with an intelligent tester when
the ECM is in check mode. In check mode, the ECM uses 1
trip detection logic, which is more sensitive to malfunctions
than normal mode (default), which uses 2 trip detection logic.
1. Clear the DTCs.
2. Switch the ECM from normal mode to check mode using
an intelligent tester (See page ES-49).
3. Perform a simulation test (See page IN-40).
4. Check and wiggle the harness(es), connector(s) and
terminal(s) (See page IN-45). ES
