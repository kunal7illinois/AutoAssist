2) Key Battery and Vehicle Battery Saving Function
In the smart key system, if the key is constantly located within the vehicle exterior actuation area of the
doors, the system will maintain periodic communication with the key. Therefore, if the vehicle remains
parked in that state for a long time, the key battery and the vehicle battery could be drained.
For this reason, if this state continues longer than 10 minutes, the smart key system automatically
becomes deactivated.
