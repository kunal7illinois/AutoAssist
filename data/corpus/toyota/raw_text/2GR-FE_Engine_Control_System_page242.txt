A Direct Ignition System (DIS) is used on this vehicle.
The DIS is a 1-cylinder ignition system in which each cylinder is ignited by one ignition coil and spark plug
is connected to the end of each secondary wiring. A powerful voltage, generated in the secondary wiring,
is applied directly to each spark plug. The sparks of the spark plugs pass from the center electrode to the
ground electrodes.
The ECM determines the ignition timing and transmits the ignition signals (IGT) to each cylinder. Using the
IGT signal, the ECM turns the power transistor inside the igniter on and off. The power transistor, in turn,
switches on and off the current to the primary coil. When the current to the primary coil is cut off, a
powerful voltage is generated in the secondary coil. This voltage is applied to the spark plugs, causing
them to spark inside the cylinders. As the ECM cuts the current to the primary coil off, the igniter sends
back an ignition confirmation signal (IGF) to the ECM, for each cylinder ignition.
