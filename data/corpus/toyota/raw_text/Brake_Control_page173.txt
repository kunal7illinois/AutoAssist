BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
9 CHECK SPEED SENSOR AND SPEED SENSOR ROTOR SERRATIONS
(a) Reconnect the front speed sensor connector.
Skid Control ECU Harness Side (b) Connect the oscilloscope to the front speed sensor
Connector Front View: terminal of the skid control ECU.
(c) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
FR+ OK:
A26 FL- The same waveform is output from all the 4 wheels
and there is no noise or interference in the
waveform.
HINT:
• As the vehicle speed (wheel revolution speed)
increases, a cycle of the waveform narrows and the
FR- FL+
output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
Normal Signal Waveform:
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated due to
BC
speed sensor rotor's scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to it.

10 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Reconnect the skid control ECU connector.
(b) Clear the DTC (See page BC-141).
(c) Start the engine.
(d) Drive the vehicle at the speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) or
more for at least 60 seconds.
(e) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-141).

If troubleshooting has been carried out according to the
Problem Symptoms Table, refer back to the table and
proceed to the next step (See page BC-134).
