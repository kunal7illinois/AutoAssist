Heated Oxygen Sensor and Air Fuel Ratio Sensor
1) General
(cid:1) The heated oxygen sensor and the air fuel ratio sensor differ in output characteristics.
(cid:1) The output voltage of the heated oxygen sensor changes in accordance with the oxygen concentration
in the exhaust gas. The ECM uses this output voltage to determine whether the present air-fuel ratio
is richer or leaner than the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio.
(cid:1) Approximately 0.4 V is constantly applied to the air-fuel ratio sensor, which outputs an amperage that
varies in accordance with the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas. The ECM converts the changes
in the output amperage into voltage in order to linearly detect the present air-fuel ratio.
