NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
If the display shows an error message after having
connected the cable of the intelligent tester to the
DLC3, turn the ignition switch on (IG), and operated
the tester, there is a problem on either the vehicle
side or the tool side.
• If communication is normal when the tool is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
on the original vehicle.
• If communication is still impossible when the tool
is connected to another vehicle, the problem is
probably in the tool itself. Consult the Service
ME
Department listed in the tool's instruction manual.
