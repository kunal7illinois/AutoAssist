2AZ-FE EMISSION CONTROL – EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM
(c) Apply 4 kPa (41 kgf/cm2, 30 mmHg) of pressure to
the vent line of the fuel tank.
HINT:
Perform this inspection with the fuel tank less than
90% full. When the fuel tank is full, the fuel cutoff
valve closes and pressure is released through the
1.5 mm orifice. As a result, when the fuel tank cap is
removed, the pressure does not decrease smoothly.
(d) Check that the fuel tank pressure is maintained for
some time, and does not decrease immediately.
HINT:
If the pressure decreases immediately, one of the
following may be the cause:
• The fuel tank cap is not completely tightened.
• The fuel tank cap is damaged.
• Air is leaking from the vent line.
• The fuel tank is damaged.
(e) When the fuel tank cap is removed, check that
pressure is released smoothly.
HINT:
If the pressure does not drop, replace the fuel tank
assembly.
(f) Reconnect the vent line tube to the canister.
EC
6. CHECK AIR INLET LINE
(a) Disconnect the air inlet line hose from the charcoal
canister.
(b) Check that air flows freely into the air inlet line.
HINT:
If air does not flow freely into the air inlet line, repair
or replace it.
(c) Reconnect the air inlet line hose to the charcoal
canister.
