BRAKE CONTROL – ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM
DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE CHART
NOTICE:
Turn the ignition switch off before removing parts.
HINT:
• If no abnormality is found when inspecting parts, inspect
the skid control ECU and ground points for poor contact.
• If a malfunction code is displayed during the DTC check,
check the circuit indicated by the DTC. For details of each
code, refer to the "See page" for respective "DTC No." in
the DTC chart.
• When 2 or more DTCs are detected, perform circuit
inspection one by one until the problem is identified.
