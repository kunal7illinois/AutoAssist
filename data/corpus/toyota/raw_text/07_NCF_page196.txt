9. Diagnosis
(cid:3) When the ECM detects a malfunction, the ECM makes a diagnosis and memorizes the information related
to the fault. Furthermore, the MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) in the combination meter illuminates or
blinks to inform the driver of the malfunction.
(cid:3) At the same time, the DTC (Diagnosis Trouble Code) are stored in the memory. The DTC can be read by
connecting a hand-held tester.
(cid:3) For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
Service Tip
The ECM uses the CAN protocol for diagnostic communication. Therefore, a hand-held tester and
a dedicated adapter [CAN VIM (Vehicle Interface Module)] are required for accessing diagnostic
data. For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
10. Fail-safe
