CH-8 CHASSIS - U250E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
(cid:2)ATF (AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID) WS
(cid:1) ATF WS is used to reduce the resistance of the ATF and improve the fuel economy by reducing its viscosity
in the practical operating temperature range. At higher fluid temperatures, the viscosity is the same as that
of ATF Type T-IV, which ensures the durability of the automatic transaxle.
(cid:1) ATF WS and other types of ATF (ATF Type T-IV, D-II.) are not interchangeable.
