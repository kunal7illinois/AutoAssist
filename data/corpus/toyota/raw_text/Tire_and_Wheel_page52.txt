TW–51
TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
(b) Display the "Tire Inflation Pressure" data for each wheel
using the intelligent tester.
(c) Rapidly reduce the tire pressure for each wheel at least
40 kPa (0.41 kg/cm2, 5.8 psi) within 30 seconds. If "Tire
Inflation Pressure" displayed on the tester (ID1 to ID4 or
ID5) does not change, the tire pressure monitor valve
corresponds to the DTC that was detected.
HINT:
• Identify the malfunctioning tire pressure monitor valve
by repeatedly decreasing the tire pressure for each
tire.
• Record which "TIREPRESS" data (ID1 to ID4 or ID5)
corresponds to each tire.

Result
Condition Detection Condition
One of "Tire Inflation Pressure" data (ID1 to ID4 or ID5) changed. Normal
"Tire Inflation Pressure" data did not change. Transmitter corresponding to DTC
NOTICE:
• When "TIREPRESS" data has not changed, reset
the tire pressure to the appropriate specified
value and rotate the tire 90 to 270 degrees. Then
forcibly transmit the transmitter ID and recheck.
• Record the transmitter ID and position of
transmitters that are normal.
(e) When the "TIREPRESS" data (ID1 to ID4 or ID5) has
changed, repeat this procedure to identify the tire
pressure warning valve and transmitter that corresponds
to a DTC.
(f) When all of the "TIREPRESS" data (ID1 to ID4 or ID5)
have changed, identify the malfunctioning tire pressure
warning valve and transmitter using recorded ID
numbers and output DTC.
(g) Set the tire pressures to the appropriate specified
values.
