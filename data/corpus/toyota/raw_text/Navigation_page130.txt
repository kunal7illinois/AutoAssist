INSPECTION PROCEDURE
1 CHECK CABIN
(a) Check the cabin for any object that might interrupt radio
reception on the instrument panel. If such an object
exists, remove it and check if the GPS mark reappears.
HINT:
The GPS uses extremely faint radio waves originating
from satellites. If the signal is interrupted by obstructions
or other radio waves, the GPS may not be able to
properly receive the signal.
OK:
Mark appears.

NORMAL OPERATION
2 CHECK SURROUNDINGS
(a) Check if the vehicle is in a location where GPS signal
reception is poor. If the vehicle is in such a place,
relocate the vehicle and check if the GPS mark
reappears.
HINT:
The GPS uses 24 satellites in 6 orbits. At any point in
time, 4 satellites should be able to pinpoint your vehicle.
However, GPS signals may not reach the vehicle due to
influence from the surroundings, vehicle direction, and
time. For illustrated examples, see below.
