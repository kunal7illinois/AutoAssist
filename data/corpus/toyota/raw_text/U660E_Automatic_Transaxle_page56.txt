U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
DTC P0500 Vehicle Speed Sensor "A"
DESCRIPTION
The speed sensors detect the wheel speed and sends the appropriate signals to the skid control ECU.
The skid control ECU converts these wheel speed signals into a 4-pulse signal and outputs it to the TCM
AX
via the combination meter. The TCM determines the vehicle speed based on the frequency of these pulse
signals.

P0500 speed is 300 rpm or more, the vehicle speed signal is
• Combination meter
not input for 2 seconds or more.
• TCM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The TCM assumes that the vehicle is being driven when the transmission counter gear indicates more
than 300 rpm and over 30 seconds have passed since the park/neutral position switch was turned off. If
there is no signal from the vehicle speed sensor with these conditions satisfied, the TCM concludes that
the vehicle speed sensor is malfunctioning. The TCM will turn on the MIL and a DTC will be set.
