1. BASIC DIMENSIONS
distance
(a) There are two types of dimensions in the diagram.
(1) (Three-dimensional distance)
(cid:1) Straight-line distance between the centers of two
measuring points.
Two-dimensional Center-to-center horizontal (2) (Two-dimensional distance)
distance distance in forward/ (cid:1) Horizontal distance in forward/rearward between the
rearward direction
centers of two measuring points.
(cid:1) The height from an imaginary standard line.
(b) In cases in which only one dimension is given, left and right
are symmetrical.
Vertical distance Vertical distance (c) The dimensions in the following drawing indicate actual dis-
to center to lower surface tance. Therefore, please use the dimensions as a refer-
ence.
Imaginary Standard Line
(d) The line that connects the places listed below is the imagi-
nary standard line when measuring the height. (The dimen-
sions are printed in the text.)
