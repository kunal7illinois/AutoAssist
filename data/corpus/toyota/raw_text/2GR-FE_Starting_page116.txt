ST–116
2GR-FE STARTING – SMART KEY SYSTEM
Power Source Mode does not Change to ON (IG and ACC)
DESCRIPTION
When the engine switch is pushed with the electrical key in the cabin, the main body ECU receives
signals to switch the power source mode.
HINT:
To allow use of the intelligent tester to inspect the push-button start function when the engine switch is off,
repeat opening and closing any of the doors. Opening and closing a door establishes communication
between the intelligent tester and the main body ECU. (Opening and closing a door can also be simulated
by operating a door courtesy light switch.)
