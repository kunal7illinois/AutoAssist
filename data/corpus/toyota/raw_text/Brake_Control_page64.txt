2 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR AND SENSOR ROTOR SERRATIONS
(a) Disconnect the skid control ECU connector.

(c) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
Normal Signal Waveform: rotated (by the sensor circuit).
OK:
BC A waveform as shown in the figure should be
output.
HINT:
• Each sensor circuit outputs the same waveform
without noise.
GND • As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed) increases,
the width of the waveform narrows and the output
voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated due to
1 V / Division, 2 ms. / Division
rotor scratches, looseness or foreign matter attached
to the speed sensor.
C140980E01 (d) Make sure that the waveform does not change while
jiggling a connector or a wire harness.
OK:
The waveform does not change.
HINT:
If the waveform changes while jiggling a connector or a
wire harness, there may be a malfunction in the
connector or the wire harness.
(e) Connect the connector.
NG Go to step 4
OK
3 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-21).
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Drive the vehicle at a speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) or more
for 60 seconds or more.
(d) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-21).
HINT:
Reinstall the sensors, connectors, etc. and restore the
vehicle to its prior condition before rechecking for DTCs.
