INTRODUCTION – HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT ECU CONTROLLED SYSTEMS
• In the DTC check, it is very important to determine
whether the problem indicated by the DTC either: 1)
still occurs, or 2) occurred in the past but has returned
to normal. In addition, the DTC should be compared
to the problem symptom to see if they are related. For
this reason, DTCs should be checked before and after
IN
confirmation of symptoms (i.e., whether or not
problem symptoms exist) to determine current system
conditions, as shown in the flowchart below.
• Never skip the DTC check. Failing to check DTCs
may, depending on the case, result in unnecessary
troubleshooting for systems operating normally or
lead to repairs not related to the problem. Follow the
procedures listed in the flowchart in the correct order.
• The following flowchart shows how to proceed with
troubleshooting using the DTC check. Directions from
the flowchart will indicate how to proceed either to
DTC troubleshooting or to the troubleshooting of each
problem symptom.
