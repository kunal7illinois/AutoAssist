(cid:4)CHARGING SYSTEM
1. General
(cid:3) Instead of the conventional type generator, a compact and lightweight segment conductor type generator
is used. This type of generator generates a high amperage output in a highly efficient manner.
(cid:3) This generator uses a joined segment conductor system, in which multiple segment conductors are welded
together to the stator. Compared to the conventional winding system, the electrical resistance is reduced
due to the shape of the segment conductors, and their arrangement helps to make the generator more
compact.
