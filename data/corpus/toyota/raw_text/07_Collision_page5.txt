3. IMPACT BEAM REPAIR
The impact beam and bracket are necessary and important
parts that help reduce the probability of injury to passen-
gers in side collisions.
For impact beams, we use special high tensile strength
steel.
The high tensile strength steel maintains its special crystal-
line organization by heat treatment or alloy additives.
Structural parts are designed to perform in their original
shape. If parts are deformed in an accident, or if the de-
F33016
formed parts are repaired and reused, the parts may be un-
able to perform as intended.
If the impact beam or bracket is damaged, replace the door
assembly that has the damaged beam.
Also, the bumper reinforcement is a necessary and impor-
tant part that helps reduce the probability of injury to pas-
sengers in front collisions, and for the same reasons ex-
plained above, should be replaced if damaged.
