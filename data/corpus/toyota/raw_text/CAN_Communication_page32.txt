CAN COMMUNICATION – CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
FAIL-SAFE CHART
1. FAIL-SAFE FUNCTION
(a) When communication fails in any of the CAN bus
wire (communication lines) due to a short circuit or
other causes, a fail-safe functions, will operate. The
fail-safe function that is specified for each system
operates to prevent those systems from
malfunctioning.
(b) The following chart shows the relationships between
components and system functions and effects of
communication failure on these functions. (For
further details, see the pages for each system.)
