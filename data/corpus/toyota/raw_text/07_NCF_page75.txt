EG-48 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
2) Construction
(cid:1) The basic construction of the heated oxygen sensor and the air-fuel ratio sensor is the same. However,
they are divided into the cup type and the planar type, according to the different types of heater
construction that are used.
(cid:1) The cup type sensor contains a sensor element that surrounds a heater.
(cid:1) The planar type sensor uses alumina, which excels in heat conductivity and insulation, to integrate a
sensor element with a heater, thus improving the warm-up performance of the sensor.
