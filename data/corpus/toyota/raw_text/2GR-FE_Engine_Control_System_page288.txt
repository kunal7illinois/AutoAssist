INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester or the OBD II scan tool. The ECM records vehicle and
driving condition information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting,
freeze frame data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the
engine was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at
the time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK SPEEDOMETER
(a) Drive the vehicle and check whether the operation of the
speedometer in the combination meter is normal.
HINT:
• The vehicle speed sensor is operating normally if the
speedometer reading is normal.
