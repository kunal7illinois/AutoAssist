U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
1. DATA LIST
HINT:
According to the DATA LIST displayed on the intelligent tester, you can read the value of switches,
sensors, actuators and other items without removing any parts. Reading the DATA LIST as the first
step in troubleshooting is one method to save labor time.

NOTICE:
In the table below, the values listed under "Normal Condition" are reference values. Do not
depend solely on these reference values when deciding whether a part is faulty.
(a) Warm up the engine.
(b) Turn the ignition switch off.
(c) Connect the intelligent tester together with the CAN VIM (Controller Area Network Vehicle
Interface Module) to the DLC3.
(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(e) Turn on the tester.
(f) Enter the following items: "DIAGNOSIS / OBD/MOBD / ECT / DATA LIST".
(g) According to the display on the tester, read "DATA LIST".

HINT:
When DTC P0712 is output and the intelligent tester indicates 150°C (302°F) or more, there is a
short circuit.
When DTC P0713 is output and the intelligent tester indicates -40°C (-40°F), there is an open
circuit.
Measure the resistance between terminal THO1 (OT) and body ground.
Temperature Displayed Malfunction
-40°C (-40°F) Open circuit
150°C (302°F) or more Short circuit
HINT:
If a circuit related to the ATF temperature sensor becomes open, P0713 is immediately set (in
0.5 seconds). When P0713 is set, P0711 cannot be detected.
It is not necessary to inspect the circuit when P0711 is set.
1 CHECK OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0711)
(a) Connect the the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) and turn the the
intelligent tester on.
(c) Select the items: "DIAGNOSIS / OBD/MOBD / ECT /
DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES".
(d) Read the DTCs using the intelligent tester.
