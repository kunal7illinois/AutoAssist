2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
CHECKING MONITOR STATUS
The purpose of the monitor result (mode 06) is to allow
access to the results of on-board diagnostic monitoring tests
of specific components/systems that are not continuously
monitored. Examples are catalysts, evaporative emissions
(EVAP) and thermostats.
The monitor result allows the OBD II scan tool to display the
monitor status, test value, minimum test limit and maximum
test limit. These data are displayed after the vehicle has been
driven to run the monitor.
When the test value is not between the minimum and
maximum test limits, the ECM (PCM) interprets this as a
malfunction. If the test value is on the borderline of the test ES
limits, the component is likely to malfunction in the near
future.
Perform the following instruction to view the monitor status.
Although this instruction refers to the Lexus/Toyota diagnostic
tester, it can be checked using a generic OBD II scan tool.
Refer to your scan tool operator's manual for specific
procedural information.
1. PERFORM MONITOR DRIVE PATTERN
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch and the tester ON.
(c) Clear the DTCs (see page ES-35).
(d) Run the vehicle in accordance with the applicable
drive pattern described in READINESS MONITOR
DRIVE PATTERN (see page ES-19). Do not turn the
ignition switch OFF.
NOTE:
The test results will be lost if the ignition
switch is turned OFF.
2. ACCESS MONITOR RESULT
(a) Select the following items from the intelligent tester
menus: DIAGNOSIS, ENHANCED OBD II,
MONITOR INFO and MONITOR RESULT. The
monitor status appears after the component name.
• INCMP: The component has not been monitored
yet.
• PASS: The component is functioning normally.
• FAIL: The component is malfunctioning.
(b) Confirm that the component is either PASS or FAIL.
(c) Select the component and press ENTER. The
accuracy test value appears if the monitor status is
either PASS or FAIL.
3. CHECK COMPONENT STATUS
(a) Compare the test value with the minimum test limit
(MIN LIMIT) and maximum test limit (MAX LIMIT).
