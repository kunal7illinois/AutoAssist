ES–214
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
• The 1st monitor
While the engine is running and the purge VSV is ON (open), the ECM monitors the purge flow by
measuring the EVAP pressure change. If negative pressure is not created, the ECM begins the 2nd
monitor.
• The 2nd monitor
The vent valve is turned ON (closed) and the EVAP pressure is then measured. If the variation in the
pressure is less than 0.5 kPa-g (3.75 mmHg-g), the ECM interprets this as the purge VSV being stuck
closed, and illuminates the MIL and sets DTC P0441 (2 trip detection logic).
Atmospheric pressure check:
In order to ensure reliable malfunction detection, the variation between the atmospheric pressures, before
and after conduction of the purge flow monitor, is measured by the ECM.
