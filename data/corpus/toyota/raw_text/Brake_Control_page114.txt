BC–108
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
(1) Operation description
The skid control ECU detects wheel lock based
on speed signals it receives from the wheel
speed sensors. Based on this information, the
skid control ECU controls the pump motor and
solenoid valves. The pump motor and solenoid
valves are used to prevent wheel lock by
controlling the hydraulic pressure applied to the
brakes at each wheel. The ABS warning light will
come on when the system is malfunctioning.
(b) EBD (Electronic Brake force Distribution)
The EBD control utilizes ABS, and performs proper
brake force distribution between the front and rear
wheels in accordance with driving conditions.
When braking while cornering, it also controls the
brake forces of the right and left wheels, helping to
maintain vehicle behavior.
