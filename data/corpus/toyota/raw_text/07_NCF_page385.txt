BODY ELECTRICAL - AIR CONDITIONING BE-51
3. Condenser
(cid:1) A MF (Multi-Flow) type condenser is used. The condenser consists of two cooling portions: a condensing
portion and a super-cooling portion, and gas-liquid separator (modulator) are integrated together. This
condenser uses a sub-cool cycle that offers excellent heat-exchange performance.
(cid:1) In the sub-cool cycle, after the refrigerant passes through the condensing portion of the condenser, both
the liquid refrigerant and the gaseous refrigerant that could not be liquefied are cooled again in the
super-cooling portion. Thus, the refrigerant is sent to the evaporator in an almost completely liquefied
state.

Service Tip
The point at which the air bubbles disappear in the refrigerant of the sub-cool cycle is lower than the
proper amount of refrigerant with which the system must be filled. Therefore, if the system recharged
with refrigerant based on the point at which the air bubbles disappear, the amount of refrigerant would
be insufficient. As a result, the cooling performance of the system will be affected. If the system is
overcharged with refrigerant, this will also lead to a reduced performance.
For the proper method of verifying the amount of the refrigerant and for instructions on how to
recharge the system with refrigerant, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
