BC–138
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
PROBLEM SYMPTOMS TABLE
If there are no DTCs output and the problem still occurs,
check the circuits for each problem symptom in the order
given in the table below and proceed to the relevant
troubleshooting page.
HINT:
• Inspect the fuse and relay before investigating the
suspected areas as shown in the table below.
• Inspect each malfunction circuit in numerical order for the
corresponding symptom.
Vehicle Stability Control System:
Symptom Suspected Area See page
1. Check the DTC again and make sure that the normal
BC-141
system code is output.
2. IG power source circuit BC-207
3. Front speed sensor circuit BC-156
4. Rear speed sensor circuit BC-164
BC 5. Check the brake actuator assembly with the intelligent
ABS, BA and/or EBD does not operate
tester. (Check brake actuator assembly operation using the
BC-425
Active Test function.) If abnormal, check the hydraulic circuit
for leakage.
6. If the symptoms still occur even after the above circuits in
suspected areas have been inspected and proved to be
BC-426
normal, replace the brake actuator assembly (skid control
ECU).
1. Check the DTC again and make sure that the normal
BC-141
system code is output.
2. Front speed sensor circuit BC-156
3. Rear speed sensor circuit BC-164
4. Stop light switch circuit BC-213
5. Check the brake actuator assembly with the intelligent
ABS, BA and/or EBD does not operate efficiently
tester. (Check brake actuator assembly operation using the
BC-425
Active Test function.) If abnormal, check the hydraulic circuit
for leakage.
6. If the symptoms still occur even after the above circuits in
suspected areas have been inspected and proved to be
BC-426
normal, replace the brake actuator assembly (skid control
ECU).
1. Check the DTC again and make sure that the normal
BC-141
system code is output.
2. TC and CG terminal circuit BC-266
ABS sensor DTC check cannot be done
3. If the symptoms still occur even after the above circuit in
suspected areas has been inspected and proved to be normal, BC-426
replace the brake actuator assembly (skid control ECU).
