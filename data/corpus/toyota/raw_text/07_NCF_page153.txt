2) Retard
When the camshaft timing oil control valve is positioned as illustrated below by the retard signals from
the ECM, the resultant oil pressure is applied to the timing retard side vane chamber to rotate the camshaft
in the timing retard direction.

3) Hold
After reaching the target timing, the valve timing is held by keeping the camshaft timing oil control valve
in the neutral position unless the traveling state changes.
This adjusts the valve timing at the desired target position and prevents the engine oil from running out
when it is unnecessary.
