AX [Test Details]
Operate the shift solenoid S2
SOLENOID (SL) [Vehicle Condition] -
• Vehicle Stopped
• Shift lever in P or N position
[Test Details]
Operate the shift solenoid SLT and raise the line pressure.
[Vehicle Condition]
• Vehicle Stopped
SOLENOID (SLT) • IDL: ON -
HINT:
OFF: Line pressure up (When the active test of "SOLENOID (SLT)"
is performed, the ECM commands the SLT solenoid to turn off).
ON: No action (normal operation)
[Test Details]
Operate the shift solenoid SLU and raise the line pressure.
[Vehicle Condition]
• Vehicle Stopped.
SOLENOID (SLU) • IDL: ON -
HINT:
OFF: Line pressure up (When the active test of "SOLENOID (SLU)"
is performed, the ECM commands the SLU solenoid to turn off).
ON: No action (normal operation)
*: "SOLENOID (SLT)" in the ACTIVE TEST is
performed to check the line pressure changes by
connecting the SST to the automatic transaxle. The
