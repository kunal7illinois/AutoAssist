1. DTC P0450: Canister pressure sensor abnormal fluctuation
If the canister pressure sensor output [pressure] rapidly fluctuates between less than 42.1 kPa-a
(315.9 mmHg-a) and more than 123.8 kPa-a (928.4 mmHg-a), the ECM interprets this as an open or
short circuit malfunction in the canister pressure sensor or its circuit, and stops the EVAP (Evaporative
Emission) system monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (1 trip detection logic).
