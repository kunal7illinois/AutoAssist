1. Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3 (Procedure "A").
2. Start the engine and warm it up with all the accessories switched OFF, until the engine coolant
temperature stabilizes (Procedure "B").
3. Run the engine at an engine speed of between 2,500 rpm and 3,000 rpm for at least 3 minutes
(Procedure "C").
4. While running the engine at 3,000 rpm for 2 seconds and 2,000 rpm for 2 seconds, check the
waveforms of the A/F and HO2 sensors using the tester or scan tool (Procedure "D").
NOTICE:
The Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor has an output delay of a few seconds and the Heated Oxygen
(HO2) sensor has a maximum output delay of approximately 20 seconds.
