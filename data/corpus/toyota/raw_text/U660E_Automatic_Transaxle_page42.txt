U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
(b) The intelligent tester displays freeze frame data
DTC set point
recorded at five different points: 1) 3 points before
the DTC is set, 2) once when the DTC is set, and 3)
0.5 sec. 0.5 sec. 0.5 sec. once after the DTC is set. The data can be used to
simulate the vehicle's condition around the time of
the malfunction. The data may be helpful in
AX
determining the cause of a malfunction. It may also
be helpful in determining whether a DTC is being
:Freeze frame data recorded point caused by a temporary malfunction.

5. DLC3 (Data Link Connector 3)
(a) The vehicle's TCM uses the ISO 15765-4 for
CG SG CANH communication protocol. The terminal arrangement
of the DLC3 complies with SAE J1962 and matches
the ISO 15765-4 format.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the
910111213141516 DLC3, turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to
use the intelligent tester. If the screen displays a
CANL BAT communication error message, a problem exists in
A082779E65
the vehicle side or the tester side.
If the communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3 on
the original vehicle.
If the communication is still impossible when the
tester is connected to another vehicle, the problem
is probably in the tester itself. Consult the Service
Department listed in the tester's instruction manual.
Symbols (Terminal No.) Terminal Description Condition Specified Condition
CG (4) - Body ground Chassis ground Always Below 1 Ω
SG (5) - Body ground Signal ground Always Below 1 Ω
BAT (16) - Body ground Battery positive Always 11 to 14 V
CANH (6) - CANL (14) HIGH-level CAN bus line Ignition switch OFF* 54 to 69 Ω
CANH (6) - CG (4) HIGH-level CAN bus line Ignition switch OFF* 200 kΩ or higher
CANL (14) - CG (4) LOW-level CAN bus line Ignition switch OFF* 200 kΩ or higher
CANH (6) - BAT (16) HIGH-level CAN bus line Ignition switch OFF* 6 kΩ or higher
NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
6. CHECK BATTERY VOLTAGE
Battery voltage:
11 to 14 V
(a) If the voltage is below 11 V, replace or recharge the
battery before proceeding.
7. CHECK MIL
(a) Check that the MIL illuminates when turning the
ignition switch on (IG).
If the MIL does not illuminate, there is a problem in
the MIL circuit (See page ES-471).
(b) When the engine is started, the MIL should turn off.
