Engine Coolant Temperature Circuit Malfunc-
DTC P0115
tion
DTC P0117 Engine Coolant Temperature Circuit Low Input
DTC P0118 Engine Coolant Temperature Circuit High Input
DESCRIPTION
A thermistor is built into the Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor, of which the resistance value
varies according to the ECT.
The structure of the sensor and its connection to the ECM are the same as those of the Intake Air
Temperature (IAT) sensor.
HINT: ES
When any of DTCs P0115, P0117 and P0118 are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe
mode, the ECT is estimated to be 80°C (176°F) by the ECM. Fail-safe mode continues until a pass
condition is detected.

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor is used to monitor the ECT. The ECT sensor has a
thermistor with a resistance that varies according to the temperature of the engine coolant. When the
coolant temperature drops, the resistance in the thermistor increases. When the temperature rises, the
resistance drops. These variations in resistance are reflected in the output voltage from the sensor. The
ECM monitors the sensor voltage and uses this value to calculate the ECT. When the sensor output
voltage deviates from the normal operating range, the ECM interprets this as a fault in the ECT sensor
and sets a DTC.
Example:
If the sensor output voltage is -40°C (-40°F) for 0.5 seconds or more, the ECM determines that there
is an open in the ECT sensor circuit, and sets DTC P0118. Conversely, if the voltage output is more
than 140°C (284°F) for 0.5 seconds or more, the ECM determines that there is a short in the sensor
circuit, and sets DTC P0117.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 0.5 seconds after the engine is next
started.
