WIPER AND WASHER – FRONT WIPER MOTOR
(c) Automatic Stop Operation Check
(1) Put matchmarks on the windshield wiper motor
assembly. The matchmarks will be used to
confirm the return of the motor shaft to the park
+5° position.
22°
-10° (2) Connect a positive (+) battery lead to terminal
A59-5 (+1) of the connector on the wiper motor
and connect a negative battery lead to terminal
Automatic Stop Position A59-4 (E) of the wiper motor. With the motor
operating at low speed (LO), disconnect
B131458E01
terminal A59-5 (+1) to stop the wiper motor at a
position where the matchmarks do not line up.
HINT:
In the following step, connections will be made
at the wiper motor to allow verification of the
operation of the park contacts that are operated
by the cam in the wiper motor. After the
connections have been made, when the motor
is not in the park position, current will flow from
terminal A59-2 (B) through the park contacts in
the wiper motor, to terminal A59-1 (+S). The
current will then flow through the jumper wire to
terminal A59-5 (+1) through the motor to
ground (causing it to operate). When the motor
reaches the park position, the park contacts
should open, stopping the operation of the
wiper motor in the correct location. Terminals
A59-2 (B) and A59-1 (+S) are connected by the
internal cam in the wiper motor when the wiper
motor is not in the park position. Terminals A59-
1 (+S) and A59-4 (E) are connected by the
internal cam in the wiper motor when the wiper
motor is in the park position.
(3) With the ground wire still attached from the
previous step, connect a jumper lead between
terminal A59-1 (+S) and terminal A59-5 (+1).
Next, connect a positive (+) battery lead to
terminal A59-2 (B) to cause the wiper motor to
operate at low speed. If the wiper motor is
operating correctly, the wiper will operate until it WW
reaches the park position. When it reaches the
park position, it will automatically stop.
(4) Verify that the matchmarks on the windshield
wiper motor assembly are lined up.
