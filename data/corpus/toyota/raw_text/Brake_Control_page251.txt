BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
VSC Warning Light does not Come ON
DESCRIPTION
The skid control ECU communicates with the combination meter via CAN communication. If the ECU
stores a DTC, the DTC will be displayed on the multi information display in the combination meter (models
with multi information display). On models without a multi information display, the VSC warning light will
come on when the skid control ECU stores a DTC.
