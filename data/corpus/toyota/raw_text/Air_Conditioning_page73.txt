DTC B1424/24 Solar Sensor Circuit (Driver Side)
DESCRIPTION
Resistance of Photodiode
High
Low
Weak Strong
Strength of Solar Radiation
E107008E01
The solar sensor, which is installed on the upper side of the instrument panel, detects sunlight and
controls the air conditioning in AUTO mode. The output voltage from the solar sensor varies according to
the amount of sunlight. When the sunlight increases, the output voltage increases. As the sunlight
decreases, the output voltage decreases. The A/C amplifier detects output voltage from the solar sensor.
