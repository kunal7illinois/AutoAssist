2. Shift Lock System
General
The shift lock system function setting is as follows:
Function Without Smart Key System With Smart Key System
Key Interlock (cid:5) —
Shift Lock (cid:5) (cid:5)
(cid:3) The key interlock device prevents the key from being pulled out after the ignition switch is turned OFF,
unless the shift lever is moved to the P position. Thus, the driver is urged to park the vehicle in the P
position.
(cid:3) The shift lock mechanism prevents the shift lever from being shifted to any position other than the P
position, unless the ignition switch is ON (unless the IG-ON mode is selected)*1, and the brake pedal
is depressed. This mechanism helps to prevent unintentional acceleration.
(cid:3) The shift lock system mainly consists of the shift lock ECU, shift lock solenoid, key interlock solenoid*2
and shift lock override button.
(cid:3) The shift lock solenoid has a built-in P detection switch.
