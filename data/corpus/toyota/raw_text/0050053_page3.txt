HINT:
When any of these DTCs are set, check the APP sensor voltage by selecting the following menu items on
the intelligent tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / ACCEL POS #1 and
ACCEL POS #2.
ACCEL POS #1 ACCEL POS #2 ACCEL POS #1 ACCEL POS #2
Trouble Areas
When AP Released When AP Released When AP Depressed When AP Depressed
VCP circuit open 0 to 0.2 V 0 to 0.2 V 0 to 0.2 V 0 to 0.2 V
Open or ground short in VPA circuit 0 to 0.2 V 1.2 to 2.0 V 0 to 0.2 V 3.4 to 5.0 V
Open or ground short in VPA2 circuit 0.5 to 1.1 V 0 to 0.2 V 2.6 to 4.5 V 0 to 0.2 V
EPA circuit open 4.5 to 5.0 V 4.5 to 5.0 V 4.5 to 5.0 V 4.5 to 5.0 V

• Accelerator pedal positions are expressed as voltages.
• AP denotes for Accelerator Pedal.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
When either output voltage of VPA or VPA2 deviates from the standard range, or the difference between
the output voltages of the 2 sensor circuits is less than the threshold, the ECM determines that there is a
malfunction in the APP sensor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets a DTC.
Example:
When the output voltage of VPA drops below 0.4 V for more than 0.5 seconds when the accelerator pedal
is fully depressed, DTC P2122 is set.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 2 seconds after the engine is next started.
MONITOR STRATEGY
P2120: APP sensor 1 range check (fluctuating)
P2122: APP sensor 1 range check (low voltage)
P2123: APP sensor 1 range check (high voltage)
Related DTCs P2125: APP sensor 2 range check (fluctuating)
P2127: APP sensor 2 range check (low voltage)
P2128: APP sensor 2 range check (high voltage)
P2138: APP sensor range check (correlation)
