2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Components Operations
Canister Contains activated charcoal to absorb EVAP (Evaporative Emissions) generated in fuel tank.
Cut-off valve Located in fuel tank. Valve floats and closes when fuel tank 100 % full.
Opens or closes line between canister and intake manifold. ECM uses purge VSV to control EVAP purge flow. In order
Purge VSV (Vacuum

manifold controlled by purge VSV duty cycle ratio (current-carrying time) (Open: ON; Closed: OFF).
Controls EVAP pressure from fuel tank to canister. Valve consists of diaphragm, spring and restrictor (diameter: 0.08
Refueling valve inch). When fuel vapor and pressure inside fuel tank increase, valve opens. While EVAP purged, valve closes and
restrictor prevents large amount of vacuum from affecting pressure in fuel tank. Valve opened while refueling.
Roll-over valve Located in fuel tank. Valve closed by its own weight when vehicle overturns to prevent fuel from spilling out.
Built into ECM. To ensure accurate EVAP monitor, measures 5 hours (+-15 min) after ignition switch turned off. This
Soak timer allows fuel to cool down, stabilizing EVAP pressure. When approximately 5 hours elapsed, ECM in activated (refer to
fig. 3).
Canister pump
Consists of (a) to (d) below. Canister pump module cannot be disassembled.
module
ES Vents and closes EVAP system. When ECM turns valve ON, EVAP system closed. When ECM turns valve off, EVAP
(a) Vent valve system vented. Negative pressure (vacuum) created in EVAP system to check for EVAP leaks by closing purge VSV,
turning on vent valve (closed) and operating leak detection pump (refer to fig. 1).
(b) Canister pressure Indicates pressure as voltages. ECM supplies regulated 5 V to canister pressure sensor, and uses feedback from
sensor sensor to monitor EVAP system pressure (refer to fig. 2).
(c) Leak detection
Creates negative pressure (vacuum) in EVAP system for leak check.
pump
Has opening with 0.02 inch diameter. Vacuum produced through orifice by closing purge VSV, turning off vent valve
(d) Reference orifice
and operating leak detection pump, to monitor reference pressure. Reference pressure indicates small leak of EVAP.
