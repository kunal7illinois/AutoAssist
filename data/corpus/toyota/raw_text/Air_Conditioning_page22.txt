AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
11. ROOM TEMPERATURE SENSOR (for AUTO A/C)
The room temperature sensor detects the cabin
temperature based on changes in the resistance of its
built-in thermistor and sends a signal to the A/C
amplifier.
12. AMBIENT TEMPERATURE SENSOR
The ambient temperature sensor detects the outside
temperature based on changes in the resistance of its
built-in thermistor and sends a signal to the A/C
amplifier.
13. SOLAR SENSOR (for AUTO A/C)
(a) The solar sensor consists of a photo diode, two
amplifier circuits for the solar sensor, and frequency
converter circuit for the light control sensor.
(b) A solar sensor detects (in the form of changes in the
current that flows through the built-in photo diode)
the changes in the amount of sunlight from the LH
and RH sides (2 directions) and outputs these
sunlight strength signals to the A/C amplifier.

14. EVAPORATOR TEMPERATURE SENSOR
The evaporator temperature sensor detects the
temperature of the cool air immediately past the
evaporator in the form of resistance changes, and
outputs it to the A/C amplifier.
