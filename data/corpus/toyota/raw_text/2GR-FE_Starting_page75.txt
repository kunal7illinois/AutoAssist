INSPECTION PROCEDURE
1. EMERGENCY ENGINE START CONTROL
(a) If there is a malfunction in the stop light switch or STOP fuse, their signals may not be correctly
transmitted to the main body ECU. This may result in the engine not starting even if the engine
switch is pressed while the brake pedal is depressed and the shift lever is in the P position.
To activate the starter:
(1) Turn the engine switch from off to on (ACC).
(2) Press and hold the engine switch for 15 seconds.
