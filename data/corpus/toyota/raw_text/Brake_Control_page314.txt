4. SYMPTOM SIMULATION
HINT:
The most difficult case in troubleshooting is when no
symptoms occur. In such cases, a thorough customer
problem analysis must be carried out. Then the same or
similar conditions and environment in which the problem
occurred in the customer's vehicle should be
reproduced. No matter how experienced or skilled a
technician may be, if he proceeds to troubleshoot without
confirming the problem symptoms, he will likely overlook
something important and make a wrong guess at some
points in the repair operation. This leads to a standstill in
troubleshooting.
