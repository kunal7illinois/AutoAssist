REFRIGERANT
ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. INSPECT REFRIGERANT VOLUME
HINT:
Vehicles manufactured by TMC are equipped with a
sight glass. A simple inspection of refrigerant volume can
be performed using this sight glass. The inspection
procedure is as follows.
(a) Check the sight glass on the air conditioning tube &
accessory assembly.
(1) Prepare the vehicle according to the chart
below.
Item Condition
Vehicle door Fully open
Temperature setting MAX COLD
Blower speed HI
A/C ON
Sight Glass
(2) Compare the sight glass to the following chart.

*: Bubbles in the sight glass with the vehicle's
interior temperature above 35°C (95°F) can be
considered normal if cooling is sufficient.
2. INSPECT REFRIGERANT PRESSURE WITH
MANIFOLD GAUGE SET
HINT:
This is a method where a manifold gauge set is used to
help locate the problem.
