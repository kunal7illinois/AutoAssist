BC–283
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
(1) Operation description
The skid control ECU receives the speed signal
from each speed sensor and the hydraulic
pressure signal from the master cylinder
pressure sensor to determine whether brake
assist is necessary. If brake assist is considered
to be necessary, the skid control ECU sends
control signals to the pump motor and solenoid
valve.
The pump and solenoid valve then control the
pressure applied to each wheel cylinder.
The ABS warning light comes on to indicate a
malfunction in the BA (brake assist) system.
