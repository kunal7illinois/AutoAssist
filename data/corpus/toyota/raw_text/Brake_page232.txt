BC–226
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
HINT:
• If a speed signal of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more is input to
the skid control ECU, with the ignition switch on (IG)
and the stop light switch off, the ECU performs self
diagnosis of the motor and solenoid circuits.
• If a normal system code is output (the trouble code is
not output), slightly jiggle the connectors, wire
harness, and fuses of the brake actuator assembly.
Make sure that no DTCs are output.
• If any DTCs are output while jiggling a connector or
wire harness of the brake actuator assembly (skid
control ECU), inspect and repair the connector or wire
harness.
