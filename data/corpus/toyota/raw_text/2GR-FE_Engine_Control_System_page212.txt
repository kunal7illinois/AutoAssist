DESCRIPTION
When the engine misfires, high concentrations of hydrocarbons (HC) enter the exhaust gas. Extremely
high HC concentration levels can cause an increase in exhaust emission levels. High concentrations of
HC can also cause increases in the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) temperature, which may cause
damage to the TWC. To prevent this increase in emissions and to limit the possibility of thermal damage,
the ECM monitors the misfire rate. When the temperature of the TWC reaches the point of thermal
degradation, the ECM blinks the MIL. To monitor misfires, the ECM uses both the Camshaft Position
(CMP) sensor and the Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor. The CMP sensor is used to identify any
misfiring cylinders and the CKP sensor is used to measure variations in the crankshaft rotation speed.
Misfires are counted when the crankshaft rotation speed variations exceed predetermined thresholds.
If the misfire exceeds the threshold levels and may cause emission deterioration, the ECM illuminates the
MIL and sets a DTC.
