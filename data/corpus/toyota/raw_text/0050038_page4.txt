2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Leak detection pump Not operated by scan tool
Both of following conditions met before key off Conditions 1 and 2
1. Duration that vehicle driven 5 minutes or more
2. EVAP purge operation Performed
ECT 4.4° to 35°C (40° to 95°F)
IAT 4.4°to 35°C (40° to 95°F)
1. Key-off monitor sequence 1 to 8
1. Atmospheric pressure measurement
Next sequence run if following condition set -
Atmospheric pressure change Less than 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g) in 1 second
2. First reference pressure measurement
ES
Next sequence run if all of following conditions set Condition 1, 2 and 3
1. EVAP pressure just after reference pressure measurement start -1 kPa-g (-7.5 mmHg-g) or less
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.057 kPa-g (-36.4 to -7.93 mmHg-g)
3. Reference pressure Saturated within 60 seconds
3. Vent valve stuck closed check
Next sequence run if following condition set -
EVAP pressure change after vent valve ON (closed) 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g) or more
4. Vacuum introduction
Next sequence run if following condition set -
EVAP pressure Saturated within 15 minutes
5. Purge VSV stuck closed check
Next sequence run if following condition set -
EVAP pressure change after purge VSV ON (open) 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g) or more
6. Second reference pressure measurement
Next sequence run if all of following conditions set Condition 1, 2, 3 and 4
1. EVAP pressure just after reference pressure -1 kPa-g (-7.5 mmHg-g) or less
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.057 kPa-g (-36.4 to -7.93 mmHg-g)
3. Reference pressure Saturated within 60 seconds
4. Reference pressure difference between first and second Less than 0.7 kPa-g (5.25 mmHg-g)
7. Leak check
Next sequence run if following condition set -
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction complete Second reference pressure or less
8. Atmospheric pressure measurement
EVAP monitor complete if following condition set -
Atmospheric pressure difference between sequence 1 and 8 Within 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g)
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
P0455: EVAP gross leak
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction complete Higher than reference pressure x 0.2
P0456: EVAP small leak
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction complete Between reference pressure and reference pressure x 0.2
