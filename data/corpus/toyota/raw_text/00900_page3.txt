ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
Intelligent Tester
1. CHECK FUEL PUMP OPERATION
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON. Do not start the engine.
(c) Select the following tester menus: DIAGNOSIS,
ENHANCED OBD II, ACTIVE TEST and FUEL
PUMP/SPD. Operate the fuel pump.
(d) Touch the fuel hose in the engine compartment to
check the fuel flow, and you will be able to hear the
sound of the fuel pump.
DLC3
(e) Stop the fuel pump.
If there is no fuel flow, the fuel pump may not
operate. Check the fuel pump circuit (see page FU-
CAN VIM
33).
B127989E01 2. CHECK FUEL PRESSURE
(a) Check that the battery positive voltage is above 12
V.
(b) Discharge the fuel system pressure (see page FU-
9).
FU
(c) Disconnect the cable from the negative (-) battery
terminal.
(d) Disconnect the fuel main tube (see page FU-10).
(e) Install SST (pressure gauge) as shown in the
illustration.
SST (Hose) SST 09268-31011 (95336-08070, 90467-13001,
09268-41500), 09268-45014 (09268-41200,
Fuel Tube 09268-41220, 09268-41250)
(f) Wipe off any gasoline.
(g) Reconnect the cable to the negative (-) battery
SST (T-joint)
terminal.
(h) Start the engine.
SST
(i) Measure the fuel pressure at idle.
SST (Hose) (Pressure Gauge)
Fuel pressure:
304 to 343 kPa (3.1 to 3.5 kgf/cm2, 44 to 50 psi)
If the pressure is not as specified, check the fuel
pump and injectors.
(j) After checking the fuel pressure, disconnect the
cable from the negative (-) battery terminal and
carefully remove SST and the fuel tube connector to
SST (Fuel Tube prevent fuel from spilling.
Connector) (k) Reconnect the fuel main tube (see page FU-14).
(l) Check for fuel leaks (see page FU-14).
