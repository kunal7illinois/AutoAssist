BE-52 BODY ELECTRICAL - AIR CONDITIONING
4. A/C Compressor
General
(cid:1) The A/C compressor is a continuously variable capacity type in which its capacity can be varied in
accordance with the cooling load of the air conditioning.
(cid:1) This compressor consists of the A/C pulley, shaft, lug plate, swash plate, piston, shoe, crank chamber,
cylinder, and solenoid valve.
(cid:1) The A/C pulley with built-in magnetic clutch and the lock sensor that detects whether the magnetic
clutch is locked are installed on models with the 2GR-FE engine.
(cid:1) The DL (Damper Limiter) type A/C pulley is installed on models with the 2AZ-FE engine.
(cid:1) A solenoid valve that adjusts the suction pressure so that the compressor capacity can be controlled as
desired is provided.
(cid:1) The internal valve is provided on models with 2AZ-FE engine to improve the A/C compressor durability
under the high speed and large thermal load conditions. The internal valve is integrated into the solenoid
valve.

Lock Sensor (Only for Models with 2GR-FE Engine)
The lock sensor sends A/C pulley speed signals to the A/C ECU. The A/C ECU determines whether the
magnetic clutch is locked or not by using those signals and engine speed signals.
