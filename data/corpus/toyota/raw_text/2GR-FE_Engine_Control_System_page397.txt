2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC U0101 Lost Communication with TCM
DESCRIPTION
The Transmission Control Module (TCM) and ECM perform 2-way communications with each other via
the Controller Area Network (CAN). The TCM sends signals to the ECM concerning required engine rpm,
required engine torques, warning indicators in the combination meter, DTCs and other data. The ECM
sends signals to the TCM concerning engine rpm, opening angles of the throttle valve, temperature of
intake air, temperature of engine coolant, engine torques and other data. If the TCM cannot communicate
with the ECM, the TCM will conclude that there is a malfunction in the CAN system, illuminate the MIL and
set a DTC.
