BC–158
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
Even after the trouble areas are repaired, the ABS warning
light will not go off unless the following operations are
performed:
• (*1):
(a)Drive the vehicle at 12 mph (20 km/h) for 30 seconds or
more and check that the ABS warning light goes off.
(b)Clear the DTC.
• (*2):
(a)Keep the vehicle stationary for 5 seconds or more and
depress the brake pedal lightly 2 or 3 times.
(b)Drive the vehicle at the vehicle speed of 31 mph (50
km/h) and keep depressing the brake pedal strongly for
approximately 3 seconds.
(c)Repeat the above operation 3 times or more and check
that the ABS warning light goes off.
(d)Clear the DTC.
HINT:
In some cases, the intelligent tester cannot be used when the
BC ABS warning light remains on.
