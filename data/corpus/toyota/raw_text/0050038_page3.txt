2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(b) P0456: EVAP very small leak
In operation C, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure (vacuum) in the EVAP system and the
EVAP system pressure is measured. If the stabilized system pressure is higher than the second reference
pressure, the ECM determines that the EVAP system has a small leakage, illuminates the MIL and sets
the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
