INTRODUCTION – REPAIR INSTRUCTION
(2) Never measure the resistance of the airbag
squib. This may cause the airbag to inflate,
which could cause serious injury.

(3) Grease or detergents of any kind should not be
applied to the horn button.
(4) Store the horn button assembly in an area where
the ambient temperature is below 93°C (200°F),
the humidity is not high and there is no electrical
noise.
(5) When using electric welding anywhere on the
vehicle, disconnect the airbag ECU connectors
(4 pins). These connectors contain shorting
springs. This feature reduces the possibility of
the airbag deploying due to current entering the
squib wiring.
(6) When disposing of the vehicle or the horn button
assembly by itself, the airbag should be
deployed using SST before disposal (See page
RS-352). Activate the airbag in a safe place
away from electrical noise.
(d) FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG ASSEMBLY
(1) Always place a removed or new front passenger
airbag assembly with the pad surface facing
upward as shown in the illustration. Placing the
airbag assembly with the airbag inflation
direction facing down could cause a serious
accident if the airbag inflates.
