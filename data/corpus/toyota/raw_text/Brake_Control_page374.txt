BC–363
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
Low Battery Positive Voltage or Abnormally
DTC C1241/41
High Battery Positive Voltage
DESCRIPTION
If a malfunction is detected in the power supply circuit of the brake actuator assembly (skid control ECU),
the skid control ECU (housed in the actuator assembly) stores this DTC and the fail-safe function prohibits
ABS operation.
This DTC is output when the IG1 terminal voltage deviates from the normal condition due to a malfunction
in the power supply or charging circuit such as the battery or alternator circuit.
This DTC is cancelled when the IG1 terminal voltage returns to normal (only when the voltage returns to
normal from a voltage lower than the specified value).
