• A voltage of 12 V or 5 V is output from each ECU and then input to the combination meter. The signal
is changed to a pulse signal at the transistor in the combination meter. Each ECU controls the
respective system based on the pulse signal.
• If a short occurs in an ECU, all systems in the diagram above will not operate normally.
