BE-54 BODY ELECTRICAL - AIR CONDITIONING
(cid:1) When the solenoid valve opens (solenoid coil is not energized), the difference in pressure disappears.
Then, the pressure that is applied to the left side of the piston becomes the same as the pressure that is
applied to the right side of the piston. Thus, the spring elongates and eliminates the tilt of the swash plate.
As a result, there is no piston stroke and the discharge capacity is reduced.

Internal Valve Operation (Only for Models with 2AZ-FE Engine)
The internal valve operates when the A/C compressor speed has increased rapidly, the A/C compressor
speed is high, or when thermal load has suddenly changed. As a result, the A/C compressor capacity is
reduced, increasing the durability of the A/C compressor.
