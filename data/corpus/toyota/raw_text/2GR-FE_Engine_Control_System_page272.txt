2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(b) EVAP VSV stuck closed
In operation D, the pressure sensor measures the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) system
pressure. The pressure measurement for EVAP VSV monitor is begun when the EVAP VSV is
turned ON (open) after the EVAP leak check. When the measured pressure indicates an
increase of 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) or more, the EVAP VSV is functioning normally. If the pressure
does not increase, the ECM interprets this as the EVAP VSV being stuck closed. The ECM
illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).

2. PURGE FLOW MONITOR
EVAP Pressure During Purge Flow Monitor: The purge flow monitor consists of the two step monitors.
The 1st monitor is conducted every time and the 2nd
monitor is activated if necessary.

OK pressure is then measured. If the variation in the
1st Monitor 2nd Monitor pressure is less than 0.5 kPa (3.75 mmHg), the ECM
interprets this as the EVAP VSV being stuck closed,
