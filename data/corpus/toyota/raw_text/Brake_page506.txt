booster assembly. (Depress the brake pedal
several times with the engine stopped.)
• The brake booster made by TMC does not need
adjustment.
HINT:
• Adjustment of the brake booster push rod is required
when the brake master cylinder sub-assembly is
replaced with a new one.
• Adjustment is not necessary when the removed brake
master cylinder sub-assembly is reused and the
brake booster assembly is replaced with a new one.

HINT:
An accessory tool is enclosed with a new brake
BR master cylinder sub-assembly.

push rod and accessory tool.

HINT:
Adjust the clearance in the following cases:
Accessory Tool
• If there is a clearance between the accessory
tool and the shell of the brake booster (floating
C132707E01
accessory tool), the push rod is protruding too
far.
• If the chalk does not stick on the tip of the brake
booster push rod, the push rod protrusion is
insufficient.
(d) If the clearance is not as specified, adjust the push
rod length by holding the rod using SST and turning
the tip of the rod using a socket driver (7 mm, 0.28
SST in.).
