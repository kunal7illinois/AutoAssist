CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE CH-41
(cid:4)TORQUE CONVERTER
(cid:3) A compact, lightweight and high-capacity torque converter is used.
(cid:3) In order to make the torque converter more compact and shorten its total length, the pump impeller and
turbine runner portions have been made narrower, and the structure of the one-way clutch has been
simplified.
(cid:3) This torque converter has optimally designed fluid passages and impeller configuration resulting in
substantially enhanced transmission efficiency to ensure better starting, acceleration and fuel economy.
(cid:3) Furthermore, a hydraulically operated lock-up mechanism, which enables the lock-up (flex lock-up)
operation at low to high vehicle speeds, is used to reduce the slip loss of the torque converter.
