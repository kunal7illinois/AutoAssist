ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-65
System Operation
1) Purge Flow Control
When the engine has reached predetermined parameters (closed loop, engine coolant temp. above 80(cid:4)C
(176(cid:4)F), etc), stored fuel vapors are purged from the canister whenever the purge VSV is opened by the
ECM.
The ECM will change the duty ratio cycle of the purge VSV, thus controlling purge flow volume. Purge
flow volume is determined by intake manifold pressure and the duty ratio cycle of the purge VSV.
Atmospheric pressure is allowed into the canister to ensure that purge flow is constantly maintained
whenever purge vacuum is applied to the canister.

2) ORVR (On-Board Refueling Vapor Recovery)
When the internal pressure of the fuel tank increases during refueling, this pressure causes the diaphragm
in the refueling valve to lift up, allowing the fuel vapors to enter the canister. The air that has had the fuel
vapors removed from it will be discharged through the fresh air line. The vent valve is used to open and
close the fresh air line, and it is always open (even when the engine is stopped) except when the vehicle
is in monitoring mode (the valve will be open as long as the vehicle is not in monitoring mode). If the
vehicle is refueled in system monitoring mode, the ECM will recognize the refueling by way of the
canister pressure sensor, which detects the sudden pressure increase in the fuel tank, and the ECM will
open the vent valve.
