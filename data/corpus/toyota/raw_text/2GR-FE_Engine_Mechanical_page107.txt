2GR-FE ENGINE MECHANICAL – ENGINE UNIT
(b) Using a cylinder gauge, measure the cylinder bore
diameter at positions A and B in the thrust and axial
directions.
Standard diameter:
94.000 to 94.012 mm (3.7008 to 3.7013 in.)
Maximum diameter:
94.200 mm (3.7087 in.)
If the average diameter of 4 positions is greater than
the maximum, replace the cylinder block.

34. INSPECT PISTON SUB-ASSEMBLY WITH PIN
(a) Using a micrometer, measure the piston diameter at
right angles to the piston center line where the
distance from the piston end is as specified.
Distance:
9.8 mm (0.3858 in.)
Standard diameter:
Distance 9.8 mm 93.960 to 93.980 mm (3.6992 to 3.7000 in.)
(0.3858 in.) Maximum diameter:
93.830 mm (3.6941 in.)

35. INSPECT PISTON OIL CLEARANCE
(a) Measure the cylinder bore diameter in the thrust
directions.
(b) Subtract the piston diameter measurement from the
cylinder bore diameter measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
0.020 to 0.052 mm (0.0008 to 0.0020 in.)
Maximum oil clearance:
0.060 mm (0.0024 in.)
If the oil clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace all the pistons. If necessary, replace the
cylinder block.
