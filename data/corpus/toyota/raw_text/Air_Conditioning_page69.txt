AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
DTC B1423/23 Pressure Sensor Circuit
DESCRIPTION
This DTC is output when refrigerant pressure is extremely low (0.19 MPa (2.0 kgf/cm2, 28 psi) or less) or
extremely high (3.14 MPa (32.0 kgf/cm2, 455 psi) or more). The pressure sensor, which is installed on the
pipe of the high pressure side to detect refrigerant pressure, outputs a refrigerant pressure signal to the A/
C amplifier. The A/C amplifier converts this signal to pressure according to the sensor characteristics to
control the compressor.
HINT:
Be sure to check the refrigerant volume first when this DTC is output because this DTC can also be output
if there is no refrigerant in the system.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
• Pressure sensor
• Harness or connector between pressure sensor
B1423/23 Open or short in pressure switch circuit and A/C amplifier
• Refrigerant pipe line
• A/C amplifier
