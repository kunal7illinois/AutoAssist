CA–84
CAN COMMUNICATION – CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
HINT:
• The connectors connected to the No. 1 CAN J/C
can be distinguished according to the color of the
communication bus wires and the shape of the
connectors.
• Reconnecting the connectors to non-specified
positions on the No. 1 CAN J/C does not affect
system operation. However, it is preferred to
reconnect the connectors to their specified
positions to avoid negative effects on the wiring
such as tension on the wiring harnesses, and to
make future maintenance easier.
