CHECK FOR INTERMITTENT
PROBLEMS
HINT:
Inspect the vehicle's ECM using check mode. Intermittent
problems are easier to detect with the intelligent tester when
the ECM is in check mode. In check mode, the ECM uses 1
trip detection logic, which is more sensitive to malfunctions
than normal mode (default), which uses 2 trip detection logic.
1. Clear the DTCs (see page ES-35).
2. Switch the ECM from normal mode to check mode using
the intelligent tester (see page ES-38).
3. Perform a simulation test.
