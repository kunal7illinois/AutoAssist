3) Operation
The knocking vibration is transmitted to the
steel weight and its inertia applies pressure to Steel Weight
the piezoelectric element. The action
generates electromotive force. Inertia

4) Open/Short Circuit Detection Resistor
During the ignition is ON, the open/short circuit detection resistor in the knock sensor and the resistor
in the ECM keep the voltage at the terminal KNK1 of engine constant.
An IC (Integrated Circuit) in the ECM is always monitoring the voltage of the terminal KNK1. If the
open/short circuit occurs between the knock sensor and the ECM, the voltage of the terminal KNK1 will
change and the ECM detects the open/short circuit and stores DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code).

Service Tip
(cid:1) In accordance with the adoption of open/short circuit detection resistor, the inspection method
for the sensor has been changed. For details, refer to 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No.
RM0250U).
(cid:1) To prevent the water accumulation in the connector, make sure to install the flat type knock
sensor in the position as shown in the following illustration.
