BC–281
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
(b) EBD (Electronic Brake force Distribution)
The EBD control utilizes ABS, which ensures proper
brake force distribution between the front and rear
wheels in accordance with driving conditions. In
addition, when braking while cornering, it also
controls the brake forces of the right and left wheels,
helping to maintain vehicle behavior.

(1) Operation description
The skid control ECU receives a speed signal
from each speed sensor, and uses these signals
to detect locking of the wheels. The ECU uses
this information in order to determine
appropriate control of the solenoid valves.
The solenoid valves control the hydraulic
pressure applied to the brake cylinder at each
wheel. In this way, the solenoid valves are used
to control the brake power split between the front
and rear, and left and right wheels. The BRAKE
warning light comes on if there is a malfunction
in the EBD system.
