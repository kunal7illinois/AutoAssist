before the shock can be felt. This is used for
checking the condition of the clutches and
brakes.

NOTICE:
• Perform the test at the normal operating
ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid)
temperature: 50 to 80°C (122 to 176°F).
• Be sure to allow 1 minute interval between
tests.
• Perform the test three times and measure
the time lags. Calculate the average value
of the three time lags.
(2) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(3) Fully apply the parking brake.
(4) Start and warm up the engine and check idle
speed.
Idle speed:
approx. 650 rpm (In N position and A/C

(5) Shift the lever from N to D position. Using a stop
watch, measure the time from when the lever is
shifted until the shock is felt.
Time lag:
N to D less than 1.2 seconds
(6) In the same way, measure the time lag for N to
R.
Time lag:
N to R less than 1.5 seconds
Evaluation (If N to D or N to R time lag is longer than the specified time):
Problem Possible cause
• Line pressure is too low
N to D time lag is longer • Clutch No.1 (C 1 ) is worn
• One-way clutch (F ) is not operating properly
1
• Line pressure is too low
N to R time lag is longer • Brake No. 2 (B 2 ) is worn
• Brake No. 3 (B ) is worn
