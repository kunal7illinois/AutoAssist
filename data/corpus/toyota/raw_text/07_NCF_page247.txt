CHASSIS - SUSPENSION AND AXLE CH-83
Shock Absorber
1) General
The two functions listed below are used for the shock absorber to realize both driving stability and riding
comfort.
(cid:3) A low-pressure (N ) gas sealed type construction is used to suppress cavitation.

(cid:3) A multi-leaf type linear control valve is used on SE grade models to attain linear damping force
characteristics.

2) Construction of Multi-Leaf type Linear Control Valve
The multi-leaf type linear control valve has a structure consisting of several layered leaf valves with
different diameters. Through us of the multi-leaf type linear control valve, changes in the damping force
are made constant at low piston speeds, thus realizing excellent riding comfort and controllability.
