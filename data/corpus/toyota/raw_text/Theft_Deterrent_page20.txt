(b) Measure the voltage and resistance of the wire
harness side connector.
Symbols (Terminal No.) Wiring Color Terminal Description Condition Specified Condition
+B (E58-1) - E (E58-17) W - W-B Battery power supply Always 10 to 14 V
E (E58-17) - Body ground W-B - Body ground Ground Always Below 1 Ω
HSW (E59-24) - Body Engine hood courtesy Engine hood OPEN (OFF) 10 kΩ or higher → Below
R - Body ground
ground switch → CLOSED (ON) 1 Ω
If the result is not as specified, there may be a
malfunction on the wire harness side.
(c) Reconnect the E58 and E59 ECU connectors.
(d) Measure the voltage of the connector.

Security indicator light up
(It lights up only in arming
preparation state or alarm
IND (E58-2) - Body ground Y - Body ground Security indicator output 3 to 6 V
sounding state. It flashes
when immobiliser is
operating.)
Security horn is sounding
SH (E59-20) - Body Pulse generation
P - Body ground Security horn drive (Theft deterrent system is
ground (0 V ← → 12 V)
in alarm sounding state)
If the result is not as specified, the ECU may have a
malfunction.
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
CG SG CANH SIL 1. CHECK DLC3
(a) The main body ECU uses ISO 15765-4 for
communication protocol. The terminal arrangement
of the DLC3 complies with SAE J1962 and matches
the ISO 15765-4 format.

SIL (7) - SG (5) Bus "+" line During transmission Pulse generation
CG (4) - Body ground Chassis ground Always Below 1 Ω
SG (5) - Body ground Signal ground Always Below 1 Ω
BAT (16) - Body ground Battery positive Always 10 to 14 V
CANH (6) - CANL (14) CAN bus line Engine switch off* 54 to 67 Ω
CANH (6) - CG (4) HIGH-level CAN bus line Engine switch off* 200 Ω or higher
CANL (14) - CG (4) LOW-level CAN bus line Engine switch off* 200 Ω or higher
CANH (6) - BAT (16) HIGH-level CAN bus line Engine switch off* 6 kΩ or higher

NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the engine switch, any other switches or
the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
