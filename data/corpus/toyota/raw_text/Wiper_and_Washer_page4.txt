WIPER AND WASHER – WIPER AND WASHER SYSTEM
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
1. WASHER LINKED OPERATION
(a) This system operates the front wipers at a low
speed immediately after a jet of washer fluid when
the front washer switch is turned on for
approximately 0.3 seconds or more. If the switch is
turned off within approximately 1.5 seconds, the
system stops the wipers when the switch is turned
off. If the switch is turned on for approximately 1.5
seconds or more, the system stops the wipers
approximately 2.2 seconds after the switch is turned
off.
2. INTERMITTENT OPERATION
(a) The system operates the front wipers once in
approximately 1.6 to 10.7 seconds when the front
wiper switch is turned to the INT position. The
intermittent time can be adjusted between 1.6 and
10.7 seconds.
(b) If the wiper control switch is turned to the INT
position, current flows from the already charged
capacitor C1 to Tr1 (transistor) through terminals
INT1 and INT2 of the wiper control switch. When
Tr1 turns on, current flows from terminal +S of the
wiper control switch to terminal +1 of the wiper
control switch, to terminal +1 of the wiper motor, to
the wiper motor and finally to the ground, causing
the wiper motor to operate. At the same time,
current flows from capacitor C1 to terminal INT1 of
the wiper control switch and then INT2. When the
current flow from capacitor C1 ends, Tr1 turns off to
stop the relay contact point and halt the wiper motor.
When the relay contact point turns off, capacitor C1
begins to charge again and Tr1 remains off until
charging has been completed. This period
corresponds to the intermittent time. When
capacitor C1 is fully charged, Tr1 turns on and then
the relay contact point activates, causing the motor
to operate. This cycle is the intermittent operation.
WW The intermittent time can be adjusted by using the
intermittent time adjust dial (variable resistor) to
change the charge time of capacitor C1.
