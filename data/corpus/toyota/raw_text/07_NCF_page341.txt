BODY ELECTRICAL - MULTIPLEX COMMUNICATION BE-7
2. Communication Wire
A twisted-pair wire is used for CAN and AVC-LAN communication. A single, AV (Automobile Vinyl) wire
is used for BEAN* communication.
*: The BEAN is used in the body electrical system of the ’06 Camry and some other TOYOTA models, but
is not used on the ’07 Camry.
Communication Wire Outline
Twisted-pair Wire for CAN This communication wire is a pair of twisted lines.
Communication is driven by applying 1.5 to 2.5 V and 2.5
to 3.5 V of voltage to the two lines in order to send a single
signal.
This system, which is called a “Differential Voltage Drive”,
241BE168 reduces noise.
Twisted-pair Wire for AVC-LAN This communication wire is a pair of twisted lines.
Communication is driven by applying positive (+) and
negative (-) voltages to the two lines in order to send a
single signal. This system, which is called a “Differential
241BE168 Voltage Drive”, reduces noise.
AV Single Wire This is a lightweight single communication wire that
consists of a single core line surrounded by insulation.
Voltage is applied to this line in order to drive
communication, and this system is called a “Single Wire
240BE09 Voltage Drive”.
