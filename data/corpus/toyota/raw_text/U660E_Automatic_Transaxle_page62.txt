MONITOR DESCRIPTION
These DTCs indicate an open or short in the automatic transmission fluid (ATF) temperature sensor (TFT
sensor) circuit. The automatic transmission fluid (ATF) temperature sensor converts ATF temperature into
an electrical resistance value. Based on the resistance, the TCM determines the ATF temperature, and
the TCM detects an open or short in the ATF temperature circuit. If the resistance value of the ATF
temperature is less than 79 Ω*1 or more than 156 kΩ*2, the TCM interprets this as a fault in the ATF
sensor or wiring. The TCM will turn on the MIL and store the DTC.
*1: 150°C (302°F) or more is indicated regardless of the actual ATF temperature.
*2: -40°C (-40°F) is indicated regardless of the actual ATF temperature.
HINT:
The ATF temperature can be checked on the intelligent tester display.
