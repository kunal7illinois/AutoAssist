2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
2. The ECM sends a target duty-cycle control signal to the OCV. This control signal regulates the oil
pressure supplied to the VVT controller. The VVT controller can advance or retard the intake camshaft.
If the difference between the target and actual intake valve timing is large, and changes in the actual
intake valve timing are small, the ECM interprets this as the VVT controller stuck malfunction and sets
a DTC.
Example:
A DTC will be set when the following conditions 1), 2) and 3) are met:
1) The difference between the target and actual intake valve timings is more than 5° CA
(Crankshaft Angle) and the condition continues for more than 4.5 seconds.
2) It takes 5 seconds or more to change the valve timing by 5° CA.
3) After above conditions 1) and 2) are met, the OCV is forcibly activated 63 times or more.
3. DTCs P0011 and P0021 (Advanced Cam Timing) are detected with 1 trip detection logic.
4. DTCs P0012 and P0022 (Retarded Cam Timing) are detected with 2 trip detection logic.
These DTCs indicate that the VVT controller cannot operate properly due to OCV malfunctions or the
presence of foreign objects in the OCV.

5. The monitor will not run unless the following conditions are met:
(a)The engine is warm (the engine coolant temperature is 75°C (167°F) or more).
(b)The vehicle has been driven at more than 40 mph (64 km/h) for 3 minutes.
(c)The engine has idled for 3 minutes.
