AC–126
AIR CONDITIONING – REFRIGERANT
• Approximately 100 g (3.53 oz.) of refrigerant
may need to be charged after bubbles
disappear.
The refrigerant amount should be checked by
quantity, not with the sight glass.
HINT:
Ensure that sufficient refrigerant is available to
recharge the system when using a refrigerant
recovery unit. Refrigerant recovery units are not
always able to recover 100 % of the refrigerant from
an A/C system.
3. WARM UP ENGINE
(a) Keep the A/C switch on for at least 2 minutes to
warm up the compressor.
NOTICE:
Be sure to warm up the compressor when
turning the A/C on after removing and installing
the cooler refrigerant lines (including the
compressor), to prevent damage to the
compressor.
4. CHECK FOR LEAKAGE OF REFRIGERANT
(a) After recharging with refrigerant gas, check for
leakage of refrigerant gas using a halogen leak
detector.
(b) Carry out the test under the following conditions:
• IG OFF
AC
• Secure good ventilation (the gas leak detector
may react to volatile gases which are not
refrigerant, such as evaporated gasoline and
exhaust gas).
• Repeat the test 2 or 3 times.
• Make sure that there is some refrigerant
remaining in the refrigeration system.
When the compressor is off: approx. 392 to 588
kPa (4 to 6 kgf/cm2, 57 to 85 psi)
(c) Using a gas leak detector, check for leakage from
