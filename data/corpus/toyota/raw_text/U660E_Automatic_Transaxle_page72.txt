DTC P0717 Input Speed Sensor Circuit No Signal
AX
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
This sensor detects the rotation speed of the turbine which shows the input revolution of transaxle. By
comparing the input turbine speed signal (NT) with the counter gear speed sensor signal (NC), the TCM
detects the shift timing of the gears and appropriately controls the engine torque and hydraulic pressure
according to various conditions, thus, providing smooth gear shift.

When the speed sensor input voltage is either more
P0715
than 1.9 V or less than 0.1 V for 4.5 seconds or more.
ECM detects conditions (a), (b) and (c) continuously for
• Transmission revolution sensor (speed sensor NT)
5 sec. or more: (1-trip detection logic)
• TCM
P0717 (a) Vehicle speed: 31 mph (50 km/h) or more
(b) Park/neutral position switch (STAR and R) is OFF
(c) Speed sensor (NT): less than 300 rpm
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The NT terminal of the TCM detects a revolution signal from the speed sensor (NT) (input RPM). The
TCM calculates a gearshift comparing the speed sensor (NT) with the speed sensor (NC).
While the vehicle is operating in 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th gear in the shift position of D, if the input shaft
revolution is less than 300 rpm *1although the output shaft revolution is more than 1,000 rpm *2, the TCM
interprets this as a fault, illuminates the MIL and stores the DTC.
*1: Pulse is not output or is irregularly output.
*2: The vehicle speed is 31 mph (50 km/h) or more.
