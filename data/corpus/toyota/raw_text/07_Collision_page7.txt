2. PREPARATION FOR INSTALLATION
(a) SPOT WELD POINTS
(1) When welding panels with a combined thickness of
Less than over 3 mm (0.12 in.), use a MIG (Metal Inert Gas)
3 mm
welder for plug welding.
HINT: Spot welding does not provide sufficient dura-
bility for panels with a combined thickness of over 3
mm (0.12 in.)
F10011A
(b) APPLICATION OF WELD-THROUGH PRIMER
(SPOT SEALER)
(1) Remove the paint from the portion of the new parts
and body to be welded, and apply weld-through prim-
er.
F33008
(c) MAKING HOLES FOR PLUG WELDING
(1) For areas where a spot welder cannot be used, use a
puncher or drill to make holes for plug welding.
REFERENCE: mm (in.)
Thickness of welded portion Size of plug hole
1.0 (0.04) under ø 5 (0.20) over
1.0 (0.04) − 1.6 (0.06) ø 6.5 (0.26) over
Puncher 1.7 (0.07) − 2.3 (0.09) ø 8 (0.31) over
F33009
2.4 (0.09) over ø 10 (0.39) over
(d) SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR ELECTRICAL
COMPONENTS
(1) When welding, there is a danger that electrical compo-
nents will be damaged by the electrical current flowing
through the body.
(2) Before starting work, disconnect the negative terminal
of the battery and ground the welder near the welding
location of the body.

(e) ROUGH CUTTING OF JOINTS
20 − 30 mm Overlap
Air Saw (1) For joint areas, rough cut the new parts, leaving 20 −
30 mm (0.79 − 1.18 in.) of overlap.
