BRAKE CONTROL – ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM
Open or Short Circuit in ABS Motor Relay Cir-
DTC C0273/13
cuit
DESCRIPTION
The ABS motor relay supplies power to the ABS pump motor. While the ABS is activated, the ECU turns
the motor relay on and operates the ABS pump motor.
If the voltage supplied to the motor relay (+BM) is below the DTCs detection threshold due to low voltage
from the battery or alternator, the DTC may be stored.
DTC No. DTC Detecting Condition Trouble Area
When any of the following is detected:
• When the motor relay is actuated, voltage is not
supplied to the pump motor within 0.1 second.
• When the motor relay is changed from ON to OFF,
• ABS No. 1 fuse (Fusible link)
the remaining high voltage is more than 2 V for 1
C0273/13 • Wire harness (+BM circuit)
second.
• Brake actuator assembly (motor relay)
• For 30 to 125 msec. after the motor relay is turned
from ON to OFF, the remaining high voltage is out
of range. The voltage is still out of range when the
motor relay is turned from ON to OFF 3 times. BC
