BC–345
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
DTC C0365/28 Malfunction in Deceleration Sensor
DTC C1234/34 Yaw Rate Sensor Malfunction
DESCRIPTION
The deceleration sensor is combined with the yaw rate and acceleration sensor.
The brake actuator receives signals from the yaw rate and acceleration sensor via the CAN
communication system.
If there is trouble in the CAN communication system, DTCs U0073/94 and U0123/62 are output.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When any of the following is detected:
• Lateral acceleration difference between sensor • Yaw rate and acceleration sensor
signal and reference value is large. • Yaw rate and acceleration sensor circuit
C0365/28
• Offset value of sensor signal is higher than the • Sensor installation
standard value. • Brake actuator assembly (skid control ECU)
• Sensor signal is out of range (2.25 m/s2).
Sensor malfunction signal is received from the yaw rate • Yaw rate and acceleration sensor
C1234/34
sensor. • Yaw rate and acceleration sensor circuit BC
