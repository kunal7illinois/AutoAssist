FAIL-SAFE
When any of DTCs P2120, P2121, P2122, P2123, P2125, P2127, P2128 and P2138 are set, the ECM
enters fail-safe mode. If either of the 2 sensor circuits malfunctions, the ECM uses the remaining circuit to
calculate the accelerator pedal position to allow the vehicle to continue driving. If both of the circuits
malfunction, the ECM regards the accelerator pedal as being released. As a result, the throttle valve is
closed and the engine idles.
Fail-safe mode continues until a pass condition is detected, and the engine switch is then turned off.
