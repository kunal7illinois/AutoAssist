ES–312
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0617 Starter Relay Circuit High
DESCRIPTION
While the engine is being cranked, the positive battery voltage is applied to terminal STA of the ECM.
If the ECM detects the Starter Control (STA) signal while the vehicle is being driven, it determines that
there is a malfunction in the STA circuit. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
This monitor runs when the vehicle is driven at 12.4 mph (20 km/h) for over 20 seconds.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
