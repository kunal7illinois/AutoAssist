INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• The following conditions may also cause DTC P0505 to be set:
(a)The floor carpet overlapping onto the accelerator pedal, causing the accelerator pedal to be slightly
depressed and therefore the throttle valve position to be slightly open.
(b)The accelerator pedal being not fully released.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0505)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Enter the following the menus: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read the DTCs.
