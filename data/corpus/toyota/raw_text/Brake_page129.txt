(6) Turn the ignition switch off.
NOTICE:
If the ignition switch is turned on (IG) for
more than 15 seconds with the shift lever in
the P position (A/T) or the parking brake
applied (M/T) after zero point of the yaw rate
and acceleration sensor has been cleared,
only the zero point of the yaw rate sensor will
be stored. If the vehicle is driven under these
conditions, the skid control ECU will store
the zero point calibration for the acceleration
sensor as not being completed. The skid
control ECU will then also indicate this as a
malfunction of the VSC system using the
indicator lights (models without multi
information display) or multi information
display (models with multi information
display).
(b) Perform zero point calibration of the yaw rate and BC
acceleration sensor.
(1) Turn the ignition switch off.
