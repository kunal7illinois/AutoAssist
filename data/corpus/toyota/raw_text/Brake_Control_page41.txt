7 CHECK HARNESS AND CONNECTOR (FRONT SPEED SENSOR TO SKID CONTROL ECU)
(a) Disconnect the skid control ECU connector.
Skid Control ECU (Wire Harness Side) (b) Measure the resistance according to the value(s) in the
Connector Front View: table below.
Standard resistance:
FL+ FL- FR- FR+ A25 LH
Tester Connection Specified Condition
A25-5 (FL+) - A14-1 (FL+) Below 1 Ω
A25-6 (FL-) - A14-2 (FL-) Below 1 Ω
A14-1 (FL+) - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
Front Speed Sensor (Wire Harness Side) A14-2 (FL-) - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
Connector Front View:
RH
Tester Connection Specified Condition
A14 A35
A25-10 (FR+) - A35-1 (FR+) Below 1 Ω
BC
A25-9 (FR-) - A35-2 (FR-) Below 1 Ω
A35-1 (FR+) - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
A35-2 (FR-) - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
FL- FL+ FR- FR+
(c) Connect the connectors.

8 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL WAVEFORM
(a) Lift up the vehicle.
Front Speed Sensor (Wire Harness Side) (b) Perform the inspection using an oscilloscope.
Connector Front View: (1) Disconnect the front speed sensor connector.
(2) Connect the oscilloscope to terminals 1 and 2 of the
front speed sensor.

(3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
OK:
The same waveforms is output from front
FL- FL+ FR- FR+
wheels and there is no noise or interference in
Normal Signal Waveform:
the waveform.
HINT:
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
GND and the output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign
1 V/Division, 2 ms./Division matter attached to the speed sensor.
(4) Connect the connector.
