(a) Vehicle position tracking methods
It is essential that the navigation system correctly
tracks the current vehicle position and displays it on
the map. There are 2 methods to track the current
vehicle position: autonomous (dead reckoning) and
GPS* (satellite) navigation. Both navigation
methods are used in conjunction with each other.
