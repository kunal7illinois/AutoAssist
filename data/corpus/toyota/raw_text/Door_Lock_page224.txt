DOOR LOCK – KEY REMINDER WARNING SYSTEM
Unlock Warning Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The unlock warning switch detects if the key is in the ignition key cylinder.
The unlock warning switch turns on when the key is inserted into the ignition key cylinder and turns off
when the key is removed from the cylinder.
The main body ECU is connected to the unlock warning switch via terminal KSW and key detection status
signals are input to the main body ECU.
The main body ECU applies voltage to the unlock warning switch via terminal KSW. When the unlock
warning switch is on (there is continuity between the switch terminals), a signal indicating that the key is in
the ignition key cylinder is input to the main body ECU. When the switch is off (there is no continuity
between the switch terminals), a signal indicating that the key is not in the cylinder is input.
