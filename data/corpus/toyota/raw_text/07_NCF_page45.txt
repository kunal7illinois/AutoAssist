*: Similar high quality ethylene glycol based non-silicate, non-amine, non-nitrite, and non-borate coolant
with long-life hybrid organic acid technology. (Coolant with hybrid organic acid technology consists of
the combination of low phosphates and organic acids.)
(cid:3) SLLC is pre-mixed (50 % coolant and 50 % deionized water for U.S.A. or 55 % coolant and 45 % deionized
water for Canada), so no dilution is needed when adding or replacing SLLC in the vehicle.
(cid:3) You can also apply the new maintenance interval (every 50,000 miles/80,000 km) to vehicles initially
filled with LLC (red-colored), if you use SLLC (pink-colored) for the engine coolant change.
