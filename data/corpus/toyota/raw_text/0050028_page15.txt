(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine and turn the tester ON.
(c) Warm up the engine.
(d) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST / INJ VOL.
(e) Change the fuel injection volume using the tester,
monitoring the voltage output of Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) and
HO2 sensors displayed on the tester.
HINT:
• Change the fuel injection volume within the range of -12 %
and +12 %. The injection volume can be changed in 1 %
graduations within the range.
• The A/F sensor is displayed as AFS B1 S1, and the HO2
sensor is displayed as O2S B1 S2, on the intelligent tester.

Remains at less than 3.3 V NG
HINT:
A normal HO2 sensor voltage (O2S B1 S2) reacts in
accordance with increases and decreases in fuel injection
volumes. When the A/F sensor voltage remains at either
less or more than 3.3 V despite the HO2 sensor indicating
a normal reaction, the A/F sensor is malfunctioning.
