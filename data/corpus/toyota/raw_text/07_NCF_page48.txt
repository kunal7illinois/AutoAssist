4. Intake Manifold
(cid:1) The intake manifold is made of plastic to reduce the weight and the amount of heat transferred from the
cylinder head. As a result, it has become possible to reduce the intake air temperature and improve the
intake volumetric efficiency.
(cid:1) A resonator is installed inside the air intake chamber which makes use of the intake pulse to improve torque
in the mid-speed range.
(cid:1) The intake manifold cover is used on the intake manifold to reduce intake air noise.

5. Intake Manifold Runner Valve Assembly (California Package Model)
(cid:1) The intake manifold runner valve assembly is used in the intake manifold on the models for California
package.
This valve is actuated by the intake manifold runner valve control, which aims at improving the
combustion efficiency while a cold engine is idling.
(cid:1) The intake manifold runner valve assembly consists primarily of an intake manifold runner valve, valve
body, and an intake manifold runner valve motor assembly.
