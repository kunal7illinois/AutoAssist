DESCRIPTION
The speed sensors detect wheel speed and transmit the signals to the skid control ECU. These signals
are used for control of the ABS control system. Each of the front and rear rotors has 48 serrations.
When the rotors rotate, the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet in the speed sensor
induces AC voltage. Since the frequency of this AC voltage changes in direct proportion to the speed of
the rotor, the frequency is used by the ECU to detect the speed of each wheel.
DTCs C1271/71 to C1276/76 can be deleted when the speed sensor sends a wheel speed signal or the
test mode ends. DTCs C1271/71 to C1276/76 are output only in the test mode.
