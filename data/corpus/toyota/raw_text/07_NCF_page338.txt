BE-4 BODY ELECTRICAL - MULTIPLEX COMMUNICATION
BODY ELECTRICAL
MULTIPLEX COMMUNICATION
(cid:4)DESCRIPTION
(cid:3) The multiplex communication system of the ’07 Camry uses the 2 communication protocols described
below in order to achieve a streamlined wiring harness configuration.
- CAN (Controller Area Network): Classified into two types according to communication speed, the HS
(High Speed)-CAN is used for the power train, chassis and body electrical systems, and the MS
(Medium Speed)-CAN is used for the body electrical system.
- AVC-LAN (Audio Visual Communication - Local Area Network): Used for communication only
between the audio-visual systems.
(cid:3) The HS-CAN consists of the CAN No.1 bus and the MS-CAN consists of the MS bus. The main body ECU
with gateway function is used to transmit data between the buses.
(cid:3) Due to the introduction of the CAN system for the power train, chassis and body electrical systems, the
BEAN (Body Electronics Area Network) that is used for the body electrical system on some conventional
models is not used on this model.
(cid:3) A customized body electronics system is used, enabling the control functions of the ECUs to be set using
a hand-held tester. For details, see page BE-13.
