CH-30 CHASSIS - U250E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
7. Shifting Control in Uphill/Downhill Traveling
General
This control helps minimize the shifting of gears when the driver operates the accelerator pedal while
driving on a winding road with ups and downs, in order to ensure a smooth drive.
Shift Control in Uphill Traveling
(cid:3) When the ECM determines uphill travel, it prohibits the transaxle from shifting up into 5th after the
transaxle has shifted down below 4th.
(cid:3) When the ECM determines uphill travel with a steeper grade, it prohibits the transaxle from shifting up
into 4th after the transaxle has shifted down below 3rd.
Shift Control in Downhill Traveling
(cid:3) When the ECM determines downhill travel, it shifts down the transaxle from 5th to 4th in accordance
with the brake operation signal that is input when the driver operates the brake pedal.
(cid:3) When the ECM determines downhill travel with a steeper grade, and a brake operation signal is input
again, the ECM shifts the transaxle down from 4th to 3rd.

Uphill/Downhill Judgment
The actual acceleration calculated from the speed sensor signal is compared with the reference acceleration
stored in the ECM to judge uphill or downhill traveling.
