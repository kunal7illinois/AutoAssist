EG-56 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
Construction
1) Intake Manifold Runner Valve Assembly
(cid:3) The intake manifold runner valve assembly consists primarily of an intake manifold runner valve,
valve shaft, valve body, and an intake manifold runner valve motor assembly.
(cid:3) Each cylinder contains 1 intake manifold runner valve, which is mounted on the valve shaft axis.
(cid:3) The intake manifold runner valve motor assembly consists primarily of a DC motor that rotates the
runner valve (valve shaft), a position sensor (Hall IC) that detects the rotating position, and a gear
portion that transmits the rotation of the DC motor to the valve shaft.

2) Valve Position Sensor
(cid:3) The valve position sensor, which is a non-contact type that uses a Hall IC and a magnet, is mounted
on the valve shaft axis.
(cid:3) The valve position sensor, which is located in the intake manifold runner valve motor assembly,
detects the opening position of the runner valve. This sensor gives the ECM feedback on the opening
position of the runner valve, which is used for SFI control, as well as for detecting the failure of the
runner valve, such as if the runner valve is stuck.
(cid:3) The ECM detects a “low sensor output failure” (DTC P2016) when the output voltage of the valve
position sensor is 0.2V or less, and a “high sensor output failure” (DTC P2017) when the output
voltage is 4.8V or more.
