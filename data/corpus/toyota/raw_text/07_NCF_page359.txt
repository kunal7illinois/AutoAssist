(cid:3) An optitron display type combination meter is used on XLE and LE grade models. The optitron display
type meter realizes excellent visibility through the use of smoke acrylic in the protective panel, and bright
LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) that have high contrast to illuminate the indicator and the dial.
(cid:3) A multi-information display is provided on the speedometer on XLE grade models.
(cid:3) A meter ECU and buzzer are enclosed in the combination meter. This ECU maintains communication with
other ECUs through the CAN (Controller Area Network).
(cid:3) Illumination control, which turns on the combination meter illumination at different time intervals when
the power source* is switched to IG-ON, has been provided.
(cid:3) A step-motor type movement is used to actuate the indicators of the speedometer, the fuel gauge, the
engine coolant temperature gauge and the tachometer.
*: The power source condition can be changed by operating the engine switch on models with the smart key
system, and the ignition switch on models without the smart key system.
