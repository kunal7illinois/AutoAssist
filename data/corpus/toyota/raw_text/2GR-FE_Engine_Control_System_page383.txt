Both of the following conditions 1 and 2 are set before
-
key-off
1. Duration that vehicle has been driven 5 minutes or more
2. EVAP purge operation Performed
ECT 4.4 to 35°C (40 to 95°F)

measurement start
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.057 kPa (-36.384 to -7.929 mmHg)
3. Reference pressure Saturated
3. EVAP canister vent valve close stuck check
Next sequence is run if the following condition is met -

4. Vacuum introduction
Next sequence is run if the following condition is met -
EVAP pressure Saturated within 15 minutes
5. EVAP canister purge valve close stuck check
Next sequence is run if the following condition is met -
EVAP pressure change after purge valve is open 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) or more
