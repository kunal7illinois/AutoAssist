BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
8 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL WAVEFORM
(a) Lift up the vehicle.
(b) Perform the inspection using an oscilloscope.
A14 :LH A35 :RH
(1) Disconnect the front speed sensor connector.
(2) Connect the oscilloscope to terminals 1 and 2 of the
front speed sensor.
(3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
OK:
FL+ FL- FR+ FR- The same waveform is output from all the 4
wheels and there is no noise or interference in
Normal Signal Waveform: the waveform.
HINT:
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
and the output voltage becomes greater.
BC
GND
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to the speed sensor.
1 V/Division, 2 ms./Division
(4) Connect the connector.
C136488E02 NG Go to step 11
OK
9 READ VALUE OF INTELLIGENT TESTER (FRONT SPEED SENSOR)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Select "DATA LIST" and read the value displayed on the
intelligent tester (See page BC-307).
DATA LIST: ABS/TRAC/VSC
Measurement Item /
Item Normal Condition
Range (Display)
Wheel speed sensor (FR) reading / min.: 0 MPH (0
FR WHEEL SPD Actual wheel speed
km/h), max.: 202 MPH (326 km/h)
Wheel speed sensor (FL) reading / min.: 0 MPH (0
FL WHEEL SPD Actual wheel speed
km/h), max.: 202 MPH (326 km/h)
(d) Check that there is no difference between the speed
value output from the speed sensor displayed on the
intelligent tester and the speed value displayed on the
speedometer when driving the vehicle.
OK:
The speed value output from the speed sensor
displayed on the intelligent tester is the same as
the actual vehicle speed.
HINT:
If troubleshooting has been carried out according to the
"PROBLEM SYMPTOMS TABLE", refer back to the table
and proceed to the next step before replacing the part
(See page BC-295).
