BODY ELECTRICAL - REAR VIEW MIRROR BE-167
(cid:2)COMPASS DISPLAY
A sensor that detects the earth’s magnetic field is built inside the inside rear view mirror. This sensor is
influenced less by the magnetization of the vehicle.
(cid:1) The compass indicates north as 0(cid:3) and the forward direction of the vehicle using 8 azimuths. (N, NE, E,
SE, S, SW, W, and NW)
(cid:1) Press the Mirror switch for 3 to 6 seconds to indicate the compass.

Service Tip
To ensure an accurate compass reading, it is necessary to perform a magnetic variation (declination)
adjustment in order to set the number that identifies the region that the vehicle will be used in. The
numbers that identify the regions are shown in the illustration below.
01YBE132TE
As the compass system needs to memorize the vehicle’s marked magnetic field, it is necessary to
perform calibration for each vehicle. Once calibration has been completed, it is not necessary to
perform calibration unless a sudden magnetic field change occurs. In case of occurrence of a sudden
magnetic field change, “C” will be displayed in the compass display and it will be necessary to
perform calibration again.
