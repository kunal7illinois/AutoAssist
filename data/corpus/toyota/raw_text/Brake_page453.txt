with a new one:
• The surface of the front speed sensor is cracked,
dented, or chipped off.
• The connector or wire harness is scratched,
cracked, or damaged.
• The front speed sensor has been dropped.
(b) Measure the resistance according to the value(s) in
the table below.
Standard resistance:
2 1 LH
Tester Connection Specified Condition
0.92 to 1.22 kΩ at 20
1 (FL+) - 2 (FL-) BC
°C (68°F)
