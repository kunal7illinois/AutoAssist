AV–7
AUDIO / VISUAL – AUDIO AND VISUAL SYSTEM
(f) File names
(1) Only files with an extension of ".mp3" or ".wma"
can be recognized and played as MP3 or WMA
files.
(2) Save MP3 or WMA files with an extension of
".mp3" or ".wma".
NOTICE:
If saving non-MP3 or non-WMA files with an
extension of ".mp3" or ".wma", those files

damage to the speaker may result.
3. AVC-LAN DESCRIPTION
(a) What is AVC-LAN?
Example:
Radio Receiver AVC-LAN
Stereo Component Amplifier
(Resistor 60 to 80 Ω)
I100319E09
AVC-LAN, an abbreviation for "Audio Visual
Communication Local Area Network", is a united
standard developed by the manufacturers in
affiliation with Toyota Motor Corporation. This
standard pertains to audio and visual signals as well
as switch and communication signals.
(b) Purpose:
Recently, car audio systems have rapidly developed
and the functions have vastly changed. The
conventional car audio system is being integrated
with multi-media interfaces similar to those in
navigation systems. At the same time, customers
are demanding higher quality from their audio
systems. This is merely an overview of the
standardization background. The specific purposes
are as follows:
(1) To solve sound problems, etc. caused by using
components of different manufacturers through
signal standardization.
(2) To allow each manufacturer to concentrate on AV
developing products they do best. From this,
reasonably priced products can be produced.
HINT:
• If a short to +B or short to ground is detected
in the AVC-LAN circuit, communication is
interrupted and the audio system will stop
functioning.
