2GR-FE COOLING – COOLING FAN ECU
(e) Inspect the input signal and output current.
NOTICE:
Waveform 1 Be sure to perform the inspection with the
radiator coolant temperature less than 95°C (203
1 V/DIV °F).
(1) Connect the 400 A probe of the ammeter to
20 ms/DIV
terminal M+ of the cooling fan motor.
(2) Set the intelligent tester to the oscilloscope
function.
(3) Using the intelligent tester, check the waveform
GND
between terminals RFC and E1 of the ECM.

HINT:
• If the input signal is abnormal, there is a

malfunction in the ECM or cooling fan ECU.
• If the output current is abnormal even when
1 V/DIV
the input signal is normal, there is a
20 ms/DIV malfunction in the cooling fan ECU (RFC) or
motor.
