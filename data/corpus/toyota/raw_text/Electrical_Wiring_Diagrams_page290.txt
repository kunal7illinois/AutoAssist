System Outline
The cruise control system is a constant vehicle speed controller which controls the opening angle of the engine throttle valve
by the SW, and allows driving at a constant speed without depressing the accelerator pedal.
Set Operation
When the ON–OFF SW is turned on, the systems starts preparations for cruise control and turns on the indicator light in the
combination meter.
Set Speed Control
When the – SET SW is operated with the ON–OFF SW turned on during driving, the speed is controlled at a constant speed.
Coast Control
When the – SET SW is kept turned on during cruise control driving, the engine control module controls the throttle valve to
decelerate the vehicle speed.
Every time the – SET SW is turned on instantaneously, the vehicle speed is decelerated by approx. 1.6 km/h.
Accel Control
When the + RES SW is kept turned on during cruise control driving, the engine control module controls the throttle valve to
accelerate the vehicle speed.
Every time the + RES SW is turned on instantaneously, the vehicle speed is accelerated by approx. 1.6 km/h.
Resume Control
If the vehicle speed is within the low speed limit (Approx. 40 km/h, 25 mph) when canceling the cruise control, operation of
the + RES SW accelerates the vehicle speed and resumes the level before canceling the cruise control.
Manual Cancel Mechanism
If any one of the following signals is input during cruise control driving, the cruise control is canceled.
∗ The stop light SW is on
∗ The CANCEL SW is turned on
∗ The ON–OFF SW is turned off
∗ When switching from ON to OFF of ”D” position circuit in neutral start switch.
When the transmission is shifted from ”D” to ”N”.
When the transmission is shifted from 5, 4 to 3, 2, 1 in S mode.
Auto Cancel Function
If any of the following conditions are detected, the cruise control is canceled:
∗ Failure in the stop light SW wiring
∗ Abnormality in the vehicle speed signal
∗ Malfunction in the electronically controlled throttle parts
∗ When the vehicle speed gets slower than the low speed limit.
∗ When the vehicle speed falls to 16 km/h less than the set speed.
Overdrive Function
The overdrive may be canceled if the vehicle travels on a upward slope during cruise control driving. When the throttle
opening information indicates the hill climbing is finished after the overdrive is canceled, the vehicle returns to overdrive
mode again as the overdrive return timer is completed.
