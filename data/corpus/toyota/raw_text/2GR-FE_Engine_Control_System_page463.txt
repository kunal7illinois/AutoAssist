2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Cranking Holding Function Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The cranking holding control system provides current to the starter when the ECM detects the engine
switch's start signal (STSW). When the ECM performs a firing judgment, the system cuts current to the
starter. When an ECM receives the STSW signal, it turns on the ST CUT relay, which prevents flickering
of the combination meter, clock, audio system, etc. Also, the ECM sends a signal to the ECM's STAR
terminal. Then the STAR output signal travels through the park/neutral position (PNP) switch to the
STARTER relay, causing the starter to activate.
When the engine is cranking, the starter operation signal is sent to the ECM's STA terminal.
Keeps cranking until the firing
