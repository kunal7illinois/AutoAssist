CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-131
3) Rear Wheel Skid Restraining Control (Turn to the Right)
In rear wheel skid restraining control, the brake of the front wheel of the outer circle of the turn is applied.
Also, depending on whether the brake is ON or OFF and the condition of the vehicle, there are circumstances
in which the brake might not be applied to the wheels even if those wheels are targeted for braking.
(cid:3) The diagram below shows the hydraulic circuit in the pressure increase mode, as it controls the rear
wheel skid condition while the vehicle make a right turn.
(cid:3) In other operating modes, the pressure holding valve and the pressure reduction valve are turned
ON/OFF according to the ABS with EBD operating pattern.
(cid:3) The rear wheel skid restraining control system is activated, each solenoid operates as shown in the
