CH-150 CHASSIS - STEERING
2. Energy Absorbing Mechanism
Construction
(cid:3) The steering column has three energy absorbing mechanisms.
(cid:3) The intermediate shaft and the main shaft are joined by a serrated engagement of fine vertical teeth.
Energy is absorbed by the contraction of the engagement.
(cid:3) The breakaway bracket is bolted to the instrument panel reinforcement via a capsule. The breakaway
bracket and the capsule are held with the washer. When, due to the column tube contraction, the
breakaway bracket separates from the capsule, energy is absorbed by the friction resistance generated.
(cid:3) The contraction mechanism of the steering column tube absorbs energy by the frictional resistance
caused by the aluminum housing and the column tube.
Operation
When the steering gear box moves during a (primary) collision, the intermediate shaft contracts, thus
reducing the chance that the steering column and the steering wheel protrude further into the cabin.
When an impact is transmitted to the steering wheel in a (secondary) collision, the steering wheel and the
driver’s airbag help absorb the impact. In addition, the breakaway bracket separates, and the column tube
contracts. This sequential energy absorbing mechanism helps absorb the impact of the secondary collision.
