ES–246
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
P050A:
Accumulated air flow amount (A/T) Varies with ECT (Example: Less than 1.44 g)
P050B:
Accumulated time when ignition timing retard value insufficient 5 seconds or more
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
ES moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P050A AND/OR P050B)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
(c) Turn the tester ON.
(d) Select the following the menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read the DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC Output) Proceed To
P050A and/or P050B A
P050A and/or P050B and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs other than P050A and P050B are output,
troubleshoot those DTCs first.
B GO TO DTC CHART
A
2 READ VALUE USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (FUEL TRIM)
HINT:
Calculate the total fuel trim values to check the characteristic
deviation of the mass air flow meter.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
(c) Turn the tester ON.
(d) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / SHORT
FT #1 and LONG FT #1.
(e) Read the values displayed on the tester.
(f) Add together the SHORT FT #1 and LONG FT #1 values
to obtain the total FUEL TRIM.
OK:
Total of SHORT FT #1 and LONG FT #1 values is
between -20 % and 20 %.
