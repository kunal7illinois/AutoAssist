ES–364
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
• The ECM stops fuel injection (fuel cut) during engine
deceleration. This causes a lean condition and results in a
momentary increase in the A/F sensor output voltage.
• The ECM must establish a closed throttle valve position
learning value to perform fuel cut. If the battery terminal
has been reconnected, the vehicle must be driven over 10
mph (16 km/h) to allow the ECM terminal to be
reconnected, the vehicle must be driven at over 10 mph
(16 km/h) to allow the ECM to learn the closed throttle
valve position.
• When the vehicle is driven:
The output voltage of the A/F sensor may be below 2.8 V
during fuel enrichment. For the vehicle, this translates to a
sudden increase in speed with the accelerator pedal fully
depressed when trying to overtake another vehicle. The A/
ES
F sensor is functioning normally.
• The A/F sensor is a current output element; therefore, the
current is converted into a voltage inside the ECM.
Measuring the voltage at the connectors of the A/F sensor
or ECM will show a constant voltage result.

5 CHECK WHETHER DTC OUTPUT RECURS (DTC P2195, P2196, P2197 OR P2198)
(a) Read the DTCs using the intelligent tester.
(b) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED
OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
