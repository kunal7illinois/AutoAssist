AV–103
AUDIO / VISUAL – AUDIO AND VISUAL SYSTEM
Speaker Circuit
DESCRIPTION
• When the vehicle has a built-in type amplifier, a sound signal is sent from the radio receiver to the
speakers via the "Standard Model" circuit.
• When the vehicle has a separate type amplifier, a sound signal from the radio receiver is amplified by
the stereo component amplifier and then transmitted to the speaker via the "Premium Model" circuit.
If there is a short in this circuit, the stereo component amplifier detects it and stops output to the speakers.
Thus sound cannot be heard from the speakers even if there is no malfunction in the stereo component
amplifier or speakers.
