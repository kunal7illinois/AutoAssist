ES–23
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Monitor ID Test ID Scaling Unit Description
Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) misfire for
cylinder 1:
$A2 $0B Multiply by 1 Time EWMA = Total misfire counts for last driving cycle * 0.1 + Last
EWMA * 0.9
Misfire counts for last 10 driving cycles - Total
Ignition switch ON: Total misfire counts for last driving cycle
$A2 $0C Multiply by 1 Time Engine running: Total misfire counts for current driving cycle
Misfire counts for last or current driving cycle - cylinder 1
Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) misfire for
cylinder 2:
$A3 $0B Multiply by 1 Time EWMA = Total misfire counts for last driving cycle * 0.1 + Last
EWMA * 0.9
Misfire counts for last 10 driving cycles - Total
Ignition switch ON: Total misfire counts for last driving cycle
ES
$A3 $0C Multiply by 1 Time Engine running: Total misfire counts for current driving cycle
Misfire counts for last or current driving cycle - cylinder 2
Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) misfire for
cylinder 3:
$A4 $0B Multiply by 1 Time EWMA = Total misfire counts for last driving cycle * 0.1 + Last
EWMA * 0.9
