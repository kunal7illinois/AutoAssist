2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• If no problem is found by this diagnostic troubleshooting procedure, troubleshoot the engine
mechanical system.
• Check the engine speed. The engine speed can be checked by using the intelligent tester. To check,
follow the procedure below:
(a)Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b)Start the engine.
(c)Turn the tester on.
(d)Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / ENGINE
SPD.
The engine speed may be indicated as zero despite the engine revolving normally. This is caused
by a lack of NE signals from the crankshaft position (CKP) sensor. Alternatively, the engine speed
may be indicated as lower than the actual engine speed, if the CKP sensor output voltage is
insufficient. ES
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 INSPECT CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR
(a) Disconnect the C50 crankshaft position (CKP) sensor
connector.
CKP Sensor
(b) Measure the resistance according to the value(s) in the
table below.
Standard resistance

Terms "cold" and "hot" refer to the temperature of the
coils. "Cold" means approximately -10 to 50°C (14 to
122°F). "Hot" means approximately 50 to 100°C (122 to
212°F).
(c) Reconnect the CKP sensor connector.
