2GR-FE STARTING – SMART KEY SYSTEM
DTC B2283 Vehicle Speed Sensor Malfunction
DESCRIPTION
The skid control ECU converts these signals into 4-pulse signals and sends them to the combination
meter. After this signal is converted into a more precise rectangular waveform by the waveform shaping
circuit inside the combination meter, it is then transmitted to the main body ECU. The main body ECU
determines the vehicle speed based on the frequency of these pulse signals.
HINT:
When the main body ECU is replaced with a new one and the negative (-) battery terminal is connected,
the power source mode becomes the IG-ON mode. When the battery is removed and reinstalled, the
power source mode that was selected when the battery was removed is restored.
After the main body ECU is replaced, perform the registration procedures for the engine immobiliser
system (See page EI-8).
