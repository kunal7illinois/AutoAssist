DESCRIPTION
The intake camshaft's Variable Valve Timing (VVT) sensor (G signal) consists of a magnet and MRE
(Magneto Resistance Element).
The VVT camshaft drive gear has a sensor plate with 3 teeth on its outer circumference. When the gear
rotates, changes occur in the air gaps between the sensor plate and MRE, which affects the magnetic
field. As a result, the resistance of the MRE material fluctuates. The VVT sensor converts the gear
rotation data to pulse signals, uses the pulse signals to determine the camshaft angle, and sends it to the
ECM.
The crankshaft angle sensor plate has 34 teeth. The pickup coil generates 34 signals for each engine
revolution. Based on combination of the G signal and NE signal, the ECM detects the crankshaft angle.
Then the ECM uses this data to control fuel injection time and injection timing. Also, based on the NE
signal, the ECM detects the engine speed.
