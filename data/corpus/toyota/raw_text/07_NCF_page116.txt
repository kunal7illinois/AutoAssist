4. Timing Chain Cover
The timing chain cover has an integrated construction consisting of the cooling system (water pump and
water passage) and the lubrication system (oil pump and oil passage). Thus, the number of parts has been
reduced to reduce weight.

5. Hydraulic Lash Adjuster
(cid:1) The hydraulic lash adjuster, which is located at the fulcrum of the roller rocker arm, consists primarily of
a plunger, plunger spring, check ball, and check ball spring.
(cid:1) The engine oil that is supplied by the cylinder head and the built-in spring actuate the hydraulic lash
adjuster. The oil pressure and the spring force that act on the plunger push the roller rocker arm against
the cam, in order to adjust the valve clearance that is created during the opening and closing of the valve.
As a result, engine noise is reduced.
