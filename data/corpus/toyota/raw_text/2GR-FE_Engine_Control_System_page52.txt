FREEZE FRAME DATA
1. DESCRIPTION
The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is
stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can be
helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or
stopped, whether the engine was warmed up or not,
whether the air/fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as
other data recorded at the time of a malfunction.
HINT:
If it is impossible to duplicate the problem even though a
DTC is detected, confirm the freeze frame data.
The ECM records engine conditions as freeze frame
data every 0.5 seconds. Using the intelligent tester, five
ES DTC was set.
separate sets of freeze frame data, including the data
values at the time when the DTC was set, can be
checked.
0.5 seconds0.5 seconds0.5 seconds
– 3 data set before the DTC was set.
– 1 data set when the DTC was set.
– 1 data set after the DTC was set.
These data sets can be used to simulate the condition
of the vehicle around the time of the occurrence of the
malfunction. The data may assist in identifying of the
cause of the malfunction, and in judging whether it
Freeze frame data which can be read was temporary or not.
