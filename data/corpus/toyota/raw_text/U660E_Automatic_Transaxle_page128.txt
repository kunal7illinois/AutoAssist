INSPECTION PROCEDURE
1 CHECK OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P2714)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) and turn the intelligent
tester on.
(c) Enter the following items: "DIAGNOSIS / OBD/MOBD /
ECT / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES".
(d) Read the DTCs using the intelligent tester.
