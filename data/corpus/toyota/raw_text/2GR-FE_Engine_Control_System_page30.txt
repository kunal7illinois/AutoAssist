ES–30
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
2. ACCESS MONITOR RESULT
(a) Select the following menus on the intelligent tester:
DIAGNOSIS, ENHANCED OBDII, MONITOR INFO
and MONITOR RESULT. The monitor status
appears after the component name.
• INCMP: The component has not been monitored
yet.
• PASS: The component is functioning normally.
• FAIL: The component is malfunctioning.
(b) Confirm that the component is either PASS or FAIL.
(c) Select the component and press ENTER. The
accuracy test value appears if the monitor status is
either PASS or FAIL.
HINT:
The monitor result might be PASS on rare
ES
occasions even if the Malfunction Indicator Lamp
(MIL) is illuminated. This indicates that the system
was malfunctioning in the previous driving cycle.
This might be caused by an intermittent problem.
3. CHECK COMPONENT STATUS
(a) Compare the test value with the minimum test limit
(MIN LIMIT) and maximum test limit (MAX LIMIT).
(b) If the test value is between the minimum test limit
and maximum test limit, the component is
functioning normally. If not, the component is
malfunctioning. The test value is usually significantly
higher or lower than the test limit. If the test value is
on the borderline of the test limit, the component will
malfunction in the near future.
HINT:
The monitor result might be PASS on rare occasions even if
the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) is illuminated. This
indicates that the system was malfunctioning in the previous
driving cycle. This might be caused by an intermittent
problem.
4. MONITOR RESULT INFORMATION
If you use a generic scan tool, multiply the test value by
the scaling value listed below.
