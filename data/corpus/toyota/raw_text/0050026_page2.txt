Refer to DTC P0115 (see page ES-106).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• If any of DTCs P0115, P0116, P0117 or P0118 are set simultaneously with DTC P0125, the Engine
Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor may have an open or a short circuit. Troubleshoot those DTCs first.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
