BC–351
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
1 RECONFIRM DTC
HINT:
These codes are detected when a problem is identified in the
brake actuator assembly.
The solenoid circuits are located in the brake actuator
assembly.
Therefore, solenoid circuit inspection and solenoid unit
inspection cannot be performed. Be sure to check if the DTC
is output before replacing the brake actuator assembly.
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-302).
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Drive the vehicle at a speed of 12 mph (20 km/h) or more
for 30 seconds or more.
(d) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-302).
Result BC
Condition Proceed to
DTC is not output A
DTC is output B
HINT:
• If the normal system code is output (the trouble code
is not output), slightly jiggle the connectors, wire
harness, and fuses of the brake actuator assembly
(skid control ECU). Make sure that no DTCs are
output.
• If any DTCs are output while jiggling a connector or
wire harness of the brake actuator (skid control ECU),
inspect and repair the connector or wire harness.
• It is suspected that the DTCs were output due to a
bad connection of the connector terminal.
