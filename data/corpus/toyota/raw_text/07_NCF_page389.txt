BODY ELECTRICAL - AIR CONDITIONING BE-55
DL type A/C Pulley (Only for Models with 2AZ-FE Engine)
This pulley contains a damper to absorb the torque fluctuations of the engine and a limiter mechanism to
protect the drive belt in case the compressor locks. In the event that the compressor locks, the limiter
mechanism causes the spoke portion of the pulley to break, thus separating the pulley from the compressor.
