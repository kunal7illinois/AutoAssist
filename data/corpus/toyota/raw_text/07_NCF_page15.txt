position on the map that is displayed on the screen. Additionally, it provides voice instructions to guide
the driver along the route to reach the destination that has been selected.

Spanish.
(cid:3) The navigation system employs a voice recognition function with a voice recognition microphone
installed in the overhead console. The voice recognition function can be turned on and off using the switch
on the steering wheel.
(cid:3) The display, which consists of a wide 7.0-inch LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen with a pressure
sensitive touch panel, is easier to use.
