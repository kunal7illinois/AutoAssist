(b) Using vernier calipers, measure the valve head
margin thickness.
Standard margin thickness:
1.0 mm (0.03937 in.)
Minimum margin thickness:
0.5 mm (0.0197 in.)
Margin Thickness If the margin thickness is less than the minimum,
replace the intake valve.
A121379E01
(c) Using vernier calipers, measure the valve's overall
length.
Standard overall length:
105.85 mm (4.1673 in.)
Minimum overall length:
Overall Length 105.35 mm (4.1476 in.)
If the overall length is less than the minimum,
EM replace the intake valve.

20. INSPECT EXHAUST VALVE
(a) Using a micrometer, measure the diameter of the
valve stem.
Valve stem diameter:
5.465 to 5.480 mm (0.2151 to 0.2157 in.)
If the valve stem is not as specified, check the oil
clearance.

(b) Using vernier calipers, measure the valve head
margin thickness.
Standard margin thickness:
1.0 mm (0.0397 in.)
Minimum margin thickness:
0.5 mm (0.0197 in.)
Margin Thickness If the margin thickness is less than the minimum,
replace the exhaust valve.
A121382E01
(c) Using vernier calipers, measure the valve's overall
length.
Standard overall length:
110.40 mm (4.3464 in.)
Minimum overall length:
Overall Length 109.90 mm (4.3268 in.)
If the overall length is less than the minimum,
replace the exhaust valve.
21. INSPECT INTAKE VALVE SEAT
A121383E01 (a) Apply a light coat of Prussian blue to the valve face.
