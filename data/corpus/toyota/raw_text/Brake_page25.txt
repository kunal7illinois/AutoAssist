4. SYMPTOM SIMULATION
HINT:
The most difficult case in troubleshooting is when no
symptoms occur. In such cases, a thorough customer
problem analysis must be carried out. Then the same or
similar conditions and environment in which the problem
occurred in the customer's vehicle should be
reproduced. No matter how experienced or skilled a
technician may be, if he proceeds to troubleshoot without
confirming the problem symptoms, he will likely overlook
something important and make a wrong guess at some
points in the repair operation. This leads to a standstill in
troubleshooting.
(a) Vibration method: When vibration seems to be the
Vibrate Slightly
major cause.
HINT:
Perform the simulation method only during the
primary check period (for approximately 6 seconds
BC
after the ignition switch is turned on (IG)).
(1) Slightly vibrate the part of the sensor considered
to be the problem cause with your fingers and
check whether the malfunction occurs.
(2) Slightly shake the connector vertically and
horizontally.
HINT:
Shaking the relays too strongly may result in

open relays.
(3) Slightly shake the wire harness vertically and
horizontally. The connector joint and fulcrum of
the vibration are the major areas to be checked
thoroughly.
