2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Knock Sensor 1 Circuit Low Input (Bank 1 or
DTC P0327
Single Sensor)
Knock Sensor 1 Circuit High Input (Bank 1 or
DTC P0328
Single Sensor)
DESCRIPTION
Flat type knock sensors (non-resonant type) have structures that can detect vibrations over a wide band
of frequencies: between approximately 6 kHz and 15 kHz.
A knock sensor is fitted onto the engine block to detect engine knocking.
The knock sensor contains a piezoelectric element which generates a voltage when it becomes deformed.
ES
The voltage is generated when the engine block vibrates due to knocking. Any occurrence of engine
knocking can be suppressed by delaying the ignition timing.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
• Short in knock sensor circuit
Output voltage of knock sensor less than 0.5 V
P0327 • Knock sensor
(1 trip detection logic)
• ECM
• Open in knock sensor circuit
Output voltage of knock sensor more than 4.5 V
P0328 • Knock sensor
(1 trip detection logic)
• ECM
HINT:
When any of DTCs P0327 and P0328 are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe mode, the
ignition timing is delayed to its maximum retardation. Fail-safe mode continues until the ignition switch is
turned OFF.
