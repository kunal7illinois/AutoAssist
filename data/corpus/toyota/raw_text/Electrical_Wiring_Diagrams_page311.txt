ECT and A/T Indicator for 2GR–FE
System Outline
1. Line Pressure Optimal Control
Through the use of the solenoid valve SLT, the line pressure is optimally controlled in accordance with the engine torque
information, as well as with the internal operating conditions of the torque converter and the transaxle. Accordingly, the line
pressure can be controlled minutely in accordance with the engine output, traveling condition, and the ATF temperature, thus
realizing smooth shift characteristics and optimizing the workload in the oil pump.
2. Clutch Pressure Optimal Control
The engine control module monitors the signals from various types of sensor such as the input turbine speed sensor,
allowing shift solenoid valves SL1, SL2 and SL3 to minutely control the clutch pressure in accordance with engine output
and driving conditions. As a result, smooth shift characteristics have been realized.
3. Shifting Control in Uphill/Downhill Traveling
This control minimizes the shifting of gears when the driver operates the accelerator pedal while driving on a winding road
with ups and downs, in order to ensure a smooth drive.
4. Flex Lock–Up Clutch Control
The flex lock–up clutch control operates during acceleration, in the 4th and 5th gear in the D range, and during deceleration,
in the 4th and 5th gear in the D range and in the 4th gear in the 4 range.
5. Multi Mode Automatic Transmission
Multi mode automatic transmission have [S]–position is beside of [D]–position. If moving the selector lever ”S” side, you can
select shift range just link manual shifting.
