to the oil path, then turn the camshaft timing gear to
the advance direction (counterclockwise) by hand.

Cover the paths with a shop rag to avoid oil
splashes.

Depending on the air pressure, the camshaft timing
gear will turn to the advance angle side without
applying force by hand. Also, under the condition
