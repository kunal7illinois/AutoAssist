2 CHECK FOR SHORT TO GND IN CAN BUS WIRE (NO. 1 CAN J/C SIDE)
(a) Disconnect the CAN main bus wire white connector
No. 1 CAN J/C “A” Side (with Earth (E42) from the No. 1 CAN J/C "A" side (with earth
Terminal): terminal).

(b) Measure the resistance between terminals 6 (CANH) CA
DLC3: E10 and 4 (CG), and between terminals 14 (CANL) and 4
CANH
(CG) of the DLC3 each time a connector is
disconnected.

HINT:
Disconnect the ECU and sensor connectors other than
the DLC3 branch wires and CAN main bus lines between
the No. 1 CAN J/C.
(b) Measure the resistance between terminals 6 (CANH)
and 4 (CG), and between terminals 14 (CANL) and 4
(CG) of the DLC3 each time a connector is
CG CANL
disconnected.
