BODY ELECTRICAL - SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM BE-151
4. System Operation
General
This system makes the following judgments: unoccupied judgment, child seat judgment, child judgment,
and adult judgment. In addition, it performs an initial check to check the circuit of the AIRBAG ON/OFF
indicator lights when the ignition*1/engine*2 switch is ON.
(cid:1) The occupant classification ECU constantly monitors the weight of the front passenger seat, and makes
a judgment in accordance with the signals from the occupant classification sensor and the state of the seat
belt buckle switch, regardless of the position of the ignition*1/engine*2 switch.
(cid:1) The occupant classification ECU contains criteria value A to judge whether the seat is being occupied
by a child or a child seat in accordance with the signals from the four occupant classification sensors and
seat belt buckle switch, and criteria value B to judge whether the occupant is an adult or child (with child
seat).
(cid:1) The occupant classification ECU makes an occupied or unoccupied judgment in accordance with the
signals from the seat belt buckle switch.
Unoccupied Judgment
(cid:1) The occupant classification ECU makes an unoccupied judgment when the judgment value is lower than
criteria value A and the seat belt buckle switch is OFF.
(cid:1) If the ignition*1/engine*2 switch is turned ON in this state, the system performs an initial check, and does
not illuminate the AIRBAG ON/OFF indicator lights. Then, the system prohibits the deployment of the
front passenger airbag, front passenger side airbag, and the front passenger seat belt pretensioner, and
does not blink the seat belt reminder light.
