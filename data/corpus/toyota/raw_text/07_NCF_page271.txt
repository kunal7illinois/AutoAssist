CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-107
5. Outline of TRAC Function
(cid:3) If the driver presses the accelerator pedal aggressively when initially acceleration or when accelerating
on a slippery surface, the drive wheels could slip due to the excessive amount of torque that is generated.
By applying hydraulic brake control to the drive wheels and regulating the throttle to control the engine
output, the TRAC helps minimize the slippage of the drive wheels, thus generating the drive force that
is appropriate for the road surface conditions.
(cid:3) For example, a comparison may be made between two vehicles, one with the TRAC function and the
other without. If the driver of each vehicle operates the accelerator pedal in a rough manner while driving
over a surface with different surface friction characteristics, the drive wheel on the slippery surface could
slip as illustrated. As a result, the vehicle could become unstable.
However, when the vehicle is equipped with the TRAC function, the skid control ECU instantly
determines the state of the vehicle and operates the brake actuator in order to apply the brake of the
slipping drive wheel. Furthermore, the ECM receives the signals from the skid control ECU and regulates
the throttle in order to control the engine output. Thus, this function can constantly maintain a stable
vehicle posture.
