MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The sensing position of the Heated Oxygen (HO2) sensor has a zirconia element which is used to detect
the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas. If the zirconia element is at the appropriate temperature,
and the difference between the oxygen concentrations surrounding the inside and outside surfaces of the
sensor is large, the zirconia element generates voltage signals. In order to increase the oxygen
ES
concentration detecting capacity of the zirconia element, the ECM supplements the heat from the exhaust
with heat from a heating element inside the sensor.
Heated oxygen sensor heater range check (P0037,P0038, P0057 and P0058):
The ECM monitors the current applied to the O2 sensor heater to check the heater for malfunctions. If the
current is below the threshold value, the ECM will determine that there is an open circuit in the heater. If
the current is above the threshold value, the ECM will determine that there is a short circuit in the heater.
Example:
The ECM sets DTC P0038 or P0058 when the current in the HO2 sensor heater is more than 2 A.
Conversely, when the heater current is less than 0.3 A, DTC P0037 or P0057 is set.
Heated oxygen sensor heater performance (P0141 and P0161):
After the accumulated heater ON time exceeds 100 seconds, the ECM calculates the heater resistance
using the battery voltage and the current applied to the heater. If the resistance is above the threshold
value, the ECM will determine that there is a malfunction in the HO2S heater and set DTC P0141 and
P0161.
