The vent valve turns ON (closes) and the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) system pressure is then
measured by the ECM, using the pressure sensor, to conduct an EVAP leak check. If the pressure does
not increase when the vent valve is open, the ECM interprets this as the vent valve being stuck open. The
ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
