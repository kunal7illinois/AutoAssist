SHORT FT #1 Short-term fuel trim maintain air-fuel ratio at stoichiometric air-fuel
ratio
Overall fuel compensation carried out in long-
LONG FT #1 Long-term fuel trim term to compensate a continual deviation of
short-term fuel trim from central valve
• OL (Open Loop): Has not yet satisfied
conditions to go closed loop
• CL (Closed Loop): Using A/F sensor as
feedback for fuel control
• OL DRIVE: Open loop due to driving
FUEL SYS #1 Fuel system status
conditions (fuel enrichment)
• OL FAULT: Open loop due to detected
system fault
• CL FAULT: Closed loop but A/F sensor,
which used for fuel control malfunctioning
