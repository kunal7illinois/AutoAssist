2. INSPECT SPARK PLUG
NOTICE:
• Never use a wire brush for cleaning.
• Never attempt to adjust the electrode gap on a
used spark plug.
(a) Check the electrode.
(1) Using a megohmmeter, measure the insulation
resistance.
Standard insulation resistance:
10 MΩ or higher
HINT:
• If the result is 10 MΩ or less, clean the plug
and measure the resistance again.
• If a megohmmeter is not available, perform
Ground
the following simple inspection instead.
I039522E10
(b) Alternative inspection method:
(1) Quickly accelerate the engine to 4,000 rpm 5
times.
(2) Remove the spark plugs.
(3) Visually check the spark plug.
If the electrode is dry, the spark plug is
IG
functioning properly. If the electrode is damp,
proceed to the next step.
(c) Check the spark plug for any damage to its threads
and insulator. If there is damage, replace the spark
plug.
