ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT INSPECTION
PROCEDURE
1. BASIC INSPECTION
(a) WHEN MEASURING RESISTANCE OF
ELECTRONIC PARTS
IN
(1) Unless otherwise stated, all resistance
measurements should be made at an ambient
temperature of 20°C (68°F). Resistance
measurements may be inaccurate if measured
at high temperatures, i.e. immediately after the
vehicle has been running. Measurements should
be made after the engine has cooled down.
(b) HANDLING CONNECTORS
(1) When disconnecting a connector, first squeeze
the mating connector housing halves tightly
together to release the lock, and then press the
lock claw and separate the connector.
(2) When disconnecting a connector, do not pull on
the harnesses. Grasp the connector directly and
separate it.
(3) Before connecting a connector, check that there
are no deformations, damage, looseness or
missing terminals.
INCORRECT
(4) When connecting a connector, press firmly until
it locks with a "click" sound.
INCORRECT (5) If checking a connector with a TOYOTA
electrical tester, check the connector from the
backside (harness side) using a mini test lead.
NOTICE:
• As a waterproof connector cannot be
CORRECT
checked from the backside, check it by
connecting a sub-harness.
• Do not damage the terminals by moving

the inserted tester needle.
(c) CHECKING CONNECTORS
Looseness of Core Wire (1) Checking when a connector is disconnected:
Crimping
Squeeze the connector together to confirm that
they are fully connected and locked.
(2) Checking when a connector is disconnected:
Check by pulling the wire harness lightly from
Terminal the backside of the connector. Look for
Deformation unlatched terminals, missing terminals, loose
Pull Lightly crimps or broken conductor wires. Check
visually for corrosion, metallic or foreign matter

and water, and bent, rusted, overheated,
contaminated, or deformed terminals.
