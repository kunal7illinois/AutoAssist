Oxygen (A/F) Sensor Heater Control Circuit
DTC P0032
High (Bank 1 Sensor 1)
HINT:
• Although the DTC titles say oxygen sensor, these DTCs relate to the Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor.
• Sensor 1 refers to the sensor mounted in front of the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) and
located near the engine assembly.

DESCRIPTION
Refer to DTC P2195 (see page ES-292).
HINT:
• When either of these DTCs is set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. The ECM turns off the A/F sensor
heater in fail-safe mode. Fail-safe mode continues until the ignition switch is turned OFF.
• The ECM provides a pulse width modulated control circuit to adjust the current through the heater. The
A/F sensor heater circuit uses a relay on the B+ side of the circuit.
