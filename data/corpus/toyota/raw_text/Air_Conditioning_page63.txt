(a) Remove the solar sensor with its connector still
Solar Sensor Connector Front View: connected.
(b) Connect the positive (+) lead from the battery to terminal AC
6 (CLTB), and the negative (-) lead to terminal 3 (CLTE)
of the solar sensor.

(c) Measure the voltage according to the value(s) in the
table below.

CLTB E11-2 (TSR) - E11-3 Sensor is subjected to
0.8 to 4.3 V

Below 0.8 V
(CLTE) a cloth
NOTICE:
• The connection procedure for using a digital
E109215E12
tester such as a TOYOTA electrical tester is
shown above. When using an analog tester,
connect the negative (-) lead to terminal 6, and the
positive (+) lead to terminal 3 of the solar sensor.
• While using the battery during inspection, do not
bring the positive and negative tester probes too
close to each other as a short circuit may occur.
HINT:
• Use an incandescent light for inspection. Bring it
within about 30 cm (11.8 in.) of the solar sensor.
• As the inspection light is moved away from the
sensor, the voltage increases.
