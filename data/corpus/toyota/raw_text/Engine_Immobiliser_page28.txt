ENGINE IMMOBILISER – ENGINE IMMOBILISER SYSTEM (w/ Smart Key System)
DATA LIST / ACTIVE TEST
1. READ DATA LIST
HINT:
Using the intelligent tester to read the DATA LIST allows
the values or states of switches, sensors, actuators and
other items to be read without removing any parts. This
non-intrusive inspection can be very useful as
intermittent conditions or signals may be discovered
before parts or wiring is disturbed. Reading the DATA
LIST information early in troubleshooting is one way to
save diagnostic time.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester (with CAN VIM) to the
DLC3.
(b) Turn the engine switch on (IG).
(c) Read the DATA LIST.

2. PERFORM ACTIVE TEST
HINT:
Performing the intelligent tester's ACTIVE TEST allows
relay, VSV, actuator and other items to be operated
without removing any parts. Performing the ACTIVE
TEST early in troubleshooting is one way to save time.
The DATA LIST can be displayed during the ACTIVE
TEST.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester (with CAN VIM) to the
DLC3.
(b) Turn the engine switch on (IG).
(c) Perform the ACTIVE TEST by following the
directions on the tester screen.
