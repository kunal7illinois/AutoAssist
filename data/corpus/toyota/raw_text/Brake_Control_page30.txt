actuator systems, the skid control ECU will prohibit
power supply to the brake actuator and terminate ABS

ABS control will be prohibited, but EBD control continues
as much as possible. If EBD control is impossible, the
brake warning light will come on to warn the driver (See
page BC-19).
Malfunction Area Control Method
