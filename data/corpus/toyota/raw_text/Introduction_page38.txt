(Procedure "A")
The seat belt buzzer ON/OFF setting, which is a
setting of the buzzer function of the combination
meter, can disable the driver and front passenger
side seat belt buzzers.
NOTICE:
• These buzzers should be on for safe driving.
Perform these procedures only if it is
necessary to set the buzzer off (disabled).
• When either the battery cable or the
combination meter connector is
disconnected, these buzzers are set on
(enabled).
• Odometer returns to 0 after starting this
procedure, although it is not displayed.
HINT:
"b-oFF" indicates that the buzzer is OFF. "b-on"
indicates that the buzzer is ON. The seat belt
buzzer ON/OFF setting will be finished (the
odometer will display "ODO") if the ODO/TRIP
switch is not operated for 10 seconds or more. In
this case, perform step 11 to check that the buzzer
ON/OFF setting is complete. If it is not complete,
start from step 1 again.
