2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Insufficient Coolant Temperature for Closed
DTC P0125
Loop Fuel Control
DESCRIPTION
Refer to DTC P0115 (see page ES-105).
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) does not reach closed-
• ECT sensor
loop enabling temperature for 20 minutes (this period varies
P0125 • Cooling system
with engine start ECT)
• Thermostat
(2 trip detection logic)
ES MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The resistance of the ECT sensor varies in proportion to the actual ECT. The ECT supplies a constant
voltage to the sensor and monitors the signal output voltage of the sensor. The signal voltage output
varies according to the changing resistance of the sensor. After the engine is started, the ECT is
monitored through this signal. If the ECT sensor indicates that the engine is not yet warm enough for
closed-loop fuel control, despite a specified period of time having elapsed since the engine was started,
the ECM interprets this as a malfunction in the sensor or cooling system and sets the DTC.
Example:
The ECT is 0°C (32°F) at engine start. After about 1 minute running time, the ECT sensor still indicates
that the engine is not warm enough to begin closed-loop fuel (air-fuel ratio feedback) control. The ECM
interprets this as a malfunction in the sensor or cooling system and sets the DTC.
