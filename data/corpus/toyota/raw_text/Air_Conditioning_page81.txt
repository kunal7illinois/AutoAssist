AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
DTC B1442/42 Air Inlet Damper Control Servo Motor Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The damper servo (air inlet control) sends pulse signals to inform the air conditioning amplifier of the
damper position. The air conditioning amplifier activates the motor (normal, reverse) based on the signals
to move the air inlet damper to any position, which controls the intake air settings (FRESH, FRESH/
RECIRCULATION, and RECIRCULATION).
HINT:
Confirm that no mechanical problem is present because this diagnostic code can be output when either a
damper link or damper is mechanically locked.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
