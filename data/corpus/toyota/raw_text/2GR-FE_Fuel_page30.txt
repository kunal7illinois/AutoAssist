INSPECTION
Component Side:
Fuel Pump
1. INSPECT FUEL PUMP
(a) Inspect fuel pump resistance.
(1) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
between the terminals.
Resistance:
0.2 to 3.0 Ω at 20°C (68°F)
If the result is not as specified, replace the fuel
pump assembly.

(b) Inspect fuel pump operation.
(1) Apply battery voltage to both the terminals.
Check that the pump operates.
NOTICE:
• These tests must be done quickly (within
10 seconds) to prevent damage to the
pump.
• Keep the fuel pump as far away from the
battery as possible.
• Always switch the voltage on and off on
the battery side, not on the fuel pump
side.
