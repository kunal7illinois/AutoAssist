DOOR LOCK – SMART KEY SYSTEM
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
CAUTION:
If using a pacemaker, be sure to read the manual of the
pacemaker before using the electrical key because the
radio waves of the electrical key may affect the
pacemaker.
1. SMART KEY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
(a) In addition to conventional mechanical key and
wireless door lock control functions, the smart key
system enables door locking/unlocking, steering
lock releasing, engine starting, and luggage
compartment door opening without operating the
electrical key. The only requirement is that the
electrical key is in the user's possession.
• This system is controlled by the certification
ECU. When the certification ECU detects the
presence of an electrical key in one of the
detection areas, it identifies and checks the ID
code, and outputs operation signals to the
related ECU in accordance with their functions.
• The detection areas are formed by 6 oscillators
(2 door oscillators, 2 luggage compartment
oscillators, and 2 cabin oscillators).
