NOTICE:
The A/F sensor has an output delay of a few seconds and the HO2 sensor has a maximum output
delay of approximately 20 seconds.

Following the A/F CONTROL procedure enables technicians to check and graph the voltage outputs of
both the A/F and HO2 sensors.
To display the graph, select the following menu items on the tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II /
ACTIVE TEST / A/F CONTROL / USER DATA / AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2; and press the YES button
and then the ENTER button followed by the F4 button.
HINT:
• DTC P2A00 may be set when the air-fuel ratio is stuck rich or lean.
• A low A/F sensor voltage could be caused by a rich air-fuel mixture. Check for conditions that would
cause the engine to run rich.
• A high A/F sensor voltage could be caused by a lean air-fuel mixture. Check for conditions that would
cause the engine to run lean.
