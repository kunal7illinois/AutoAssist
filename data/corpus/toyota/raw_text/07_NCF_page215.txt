4. Centrifugal Fluid Pressure Canceling Mechanism
There are two reasons for improving the conventional clutch mechanism:
(cid:1) To prevent the generation of pressure by the centrifugal force that is applied to the fluid in piston fluid
pressure chamber (hereafter referred to as “chamber A”) when the clutch is released, a check ball is
provided to discharge the fluid. Therefore, before the clutch could be subsequently applied, it took time
for the fluid to fill the chamber A.
(cid:1) During shifting, in addition to the original clutch pressure that is controlled by the valve body, the pressure
that acts on the fluid in chamber A also exerts influence, which is dependent upon revolution fluctuations.
To address these two needs for improvement, a canceling fluid pressure chamber (hereafter referred to as
“chamber B”) has been provided opposite chamber A.

By utilizing lubrication fluid such as that of the shaft, an equal centrifugal force is applied, thus canceling
the centrifugal force that is applied to the piston itself. Accordingly, it is not necessary to discharge the fluid
through the use of a check ball, and a highly responsive and smooth shifting characteristic has been achieved.
