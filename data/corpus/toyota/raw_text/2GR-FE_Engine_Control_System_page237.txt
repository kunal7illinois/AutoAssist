Conditions Cranking or idling
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
If no signal is transmitted by the VVT sensor despite the engine revolving, or the rotations of the camshaft
and the crankshaft are not synchronized, the ECM interprets this as a malfunction of the sensor.
MONITOR STRATEGY
P0340: VVT sensor (Bank 1) open/short
P0340: VVT position/Crankshaft position misalignment (Bank 1)
P0342: VVT position sensor (Bank 1) range check (low voltage)
P0343: VVT position sensor (Bank 1) range check (high voltage)
Related DTCs
P0345: VVT sensor (Bank 2) open/short
P0345: VVT position/Crankshaft position misalignment (Bank 2)
P0347: VVT position sensor (Bank 2) range check (low voltage)
P0348: VVT position sensor (Bank 2) range check (high voltage)
