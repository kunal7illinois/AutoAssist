Circuit High Input
DESCRIPTION
The ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) temperature sensor converts the fluid temperature into a
resistance value for use by the TCM.
Resistance
Acceptable range
Temperature
G031389E14
The TCM applies a voltage to the temperature sensor through terminal OIL of the TCM.
The sensor resistance changes with the transmission fluid temperature. As the temperature becomes
higher, the sensor resistance decreases.
One terminal of the sensor is grounded so that the sensor resistance decreases and the voltage goes
down as the temperature becomes higher.
The TCM calculates the fluid temperature based on the voltage signal.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
