HINT:
• When any of these DTCs are set, check the throttle valve opening angle by selecting the following
menu items the intelligent tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / ETCS / THROTTLE
POS #1 AND THROTTLE POS #2.
• THROTTLE POS #1 denotes the VTA1 signal, and THROTTLE POS #2 denotes the VTA2 signal.
Reference (Normal Condition)
Tester Display Accelerator Pedal Fully Released Accelerator Pedal Fully Depressed
THROTTLE POS #1 0.5 to 1.1 V 3.3 to 4.9 V
THROTTLE POS #2 2.1 to 3.1 V 4.6 to 5.0 V
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM uses the Throttle Position (TP) sensor to monitor the throttle valve opening angle. There are
several checks that the ECM performs to confirm the proper operation of the TP sensor.
• A specific voltage difference is expected between the sensor terminals, VTA1 and VTA2, for each
throttle valve opening angle. If the difference between VTA1 and VTA2 is incorrect, the ECM interprets
this as a malfunction in the sensor, and sets a DTC.
• VTA1 and VTA2 each have a specific voltage range. If VTA1 or VTA2 is outside the normal operating
range, the ECM interprets this as a malfunction in the sensor, and sets a DTC.
• VTA1 and VTA2 should never be close to the same voltage level. If VTA1 is within 0.02 V of VTA2, the
ECM determines that there is a short circuit in the sensor, and sets a DTC.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 10 seconds after the engine is next started.
