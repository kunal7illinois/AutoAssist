INSPECTION
1. INSPECT TIRE
(a) Check the tires for wear and proper inflation
pressure.
Cold tire inflation pressure
Tire size Front kPa (kgf*cm2, psi) Rear kPa (kgf*cm2, psi)
P215/60R16 94V 210 (2.1, 31) 210 (2.1, 31)
P215/55R17 93V 220 (2.2, 32) 220 (2.2, 32)
When driving under the above vehicle conditions at
sustained high speeds above 160 km/h (100 mph),
in countries where such speeds are permitted by-
law, inflate the front and rear tires to 240 kPa (2.4
kgf*cm2, 35 psi) provided that it does not exceed the
maximum cold tire inflation pressure molded on the
TW tire sidewall.
(b) Using a dial indicator, check the runout of the tires.
Tire runout:
1.4 mm (0.055 in.) or less
