HINT:
Make a note of the pressures checked in steps "A" and "B"
below.
(a) Check the EVAP pressure 4 seconds after the leak
detection pump is activated* (Step "A").
*: The leak detection pump begins to operate as step 1/5
finishes and step 2/5 starts.
(b) Check the EVAP pressure again when it has stabilized.
This pressure is the reference pressure (Step "B").
