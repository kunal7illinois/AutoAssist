1. CHECK AIR FUEL RATIO COMPENSATION SYSTEM
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
(c) Select the following menu items: Data List / A/FS B1
S1 and O2S B1 S2.
(d) Warm up the A/F sensor with the engine speed at
2,500 rpm for approximately 2 minutes.
(e) Keep the engine speed at 2,500 rpm and confirm
DLC3 that the display of "A/FS B1 S1" is as shown in the
illustration.
HINT:
• The illustration may slightly differ from the display

of the A/F sensor.
(f) Confirm that the display of "O2S B1 S2" changes
between 0 to 1 V with the engine speed at 2,500
rpm.

The voltage output oscillates more than 8
Lean times in 10 seconds.
