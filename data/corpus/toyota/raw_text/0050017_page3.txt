2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Accumulated heater ON time 100 seconds or more
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
P0037:
Heater current Less than 0.3 A

ES
COMPONENT OPERATING RANGE
0.4 to 1 A (when engine idles, HO2 sensor warmed up and battery
Heated Oxygen (HO2) sensor heater current
voltage 11 to 14 V)
WIRING DIAGRAM
Refer to DTC P0136 (see page ES-136).
CONFIRMATION DRIVING PATTERN
These DTCs are detected when the engine idles for 110 seconds or more.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Sensor 2 refers to the sensor mounted behind the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) and located far
from the engine assembly.
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 INSPECT HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR (HEATER RESISTANCE)
(a) Disconnect the B19 Heated Oxygen (HO2) sensor
Component Side : connector.
(b) Measure the resistance of the HO2 sensor connector.
