4. Cylinder Block
(cid:3) Lightweight aluminum alloy is used for the cylinder block.
(cid:3) By producing the thin cast-iron liners and cylinder block as a unit, compaction is realized.
(cid:3) Air passage holes are provided in the crankshaft bearing area of the cylinder block. As a result, the air at
the bottom of the cylinder flows smoother, and pumping loss (back pressure at the bottom of the piston
generated by the piston’s reciprocal movement) is reduced to improve the engine’s output.
(cid:3) The oil filter and the air conditioning compressor brackets are integrated into the crankcase. Also, the
water pump swirl chamber and thermostat housing are integrated into the cylinder block.

NOTICE
Never attempt to machine the cylinder because it has a thin liner thickness.
