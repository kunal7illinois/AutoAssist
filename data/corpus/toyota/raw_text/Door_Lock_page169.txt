DOOR LOCK – SMART KEY SYSTEM
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. DESCRIPTION
(a) Smart key system data and the Diagnostic Trouble
Codes (DTCs) can be read from the Data Link
Connector 3 (DLC3) of the vehicle. When the
system seems to be malfunctioning, use the
intelligent tester to check for malfunctions and
perform repairs.
2. CHECK DLC3
The ECU uses ISO 15765-4 for communication. The
CG SG CANH SIL
terminal arrangement of the DLC3 complies with SAE
J1962 and matches the ISO 15765-4 format.

Symbols (Terminal No.) Terminal Description Condition Specified Condition
SIL (7) - SG (5) Bus "+" line During transmission Pulse generation
CG (4) - Body ground Chassis ground Always Below 1 Ω
SG (5) - Body ground Signal ground Always Below 1 Ω
BAT (16) - Body ground Battery positive Always 11 to 14 V
CANH (6) - CANL (14) CAN bus line Engine switch OFF* 54 to 69 Ω
CANH (6) - Battery positive (+) HIGH-level CAN bus line Engine switch OFF* 6 kΩ or higher
CANH (6) - CG (4) HIGH-level CAN bus line Engine switch OFF* 200 Ω or higher
CANL (14) - Battery positive (+) LOW-level CAN bus line Engine switch OFF* 6 kΩ or higher
CANL (14) - CG (4) LOW-level CAN bus line Engine switch OFF* 200 Ω or higher
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the vehicle for
at least 1 minute and do not operate the engine switch,
any switches or doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have a
malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester (with CAN
VIM) to the DLC3, turn the engine switch on (IG) and
attempt to use the tester. If the display indicates that a
DL
communication error has occurred, there is a problem
either with the vehicle or with the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3 of the
original vehicle.
• If communication is still not possible when the tester
is connected to another vehicle, the problem may be
in the tester itself. Consult the Service Department
listed in the tester's instruction manual.
