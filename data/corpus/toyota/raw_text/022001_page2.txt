2AZ-FE STARTING – STARTER
2. INSPECT MAGNETIC SWITCH ASSEMBLY
(a) Check the plunger.
(1) Push in the plunger and check that it returns
quickly to its original position.
If necessary, replace the magnetic switch
assembly.
A058586
(b) Check if the pull-in coil has an open circuit.
(1) Measure the resistance between terminals 50
Terminal C
and C.
Standard resistance:
Below 1 Ω
If the result is not as specified, replace the
magnetic switch assembly.
Terminal 50 Below 1 (cid:481)
A079725E01
(c) Check if the hold-in coil has an open circuit.
Body
(1) Measure the resistance between terminal 50
Below 2 (cid:481) and the switch body.
Standard resistance:
Below 2 Ω
If the result is not as specified, replace the
magnetic switch assembly.
Terminal 50

3. INSPECT STARTER ARMATURE ASSEMBLY
Below 1 (cid:481)
(a) Check if the commutator has an open circuit.
(1) Measure the resistance between the segments
of the commutator.
Standard resistance:
Below 1 Ω
Segment
If the result is not as specified, replace the
armature assembly.
ST A058372E01
(b) Check if the commutator is grounded.
10 k(cid:481) or Higher
(1) Measure the resistance between the
commutator and armature coil core.
Standard resistance:
10 kΩ or higher
If the result is not as specified, replace the
Commutator
armature assembly.
Coil Core (c) Check the commutator for contamination and burns
on its surface.
If the surface is dirty or burnt, correct it with
A058373E01
sandpaper (No. 400) or a lathe.
