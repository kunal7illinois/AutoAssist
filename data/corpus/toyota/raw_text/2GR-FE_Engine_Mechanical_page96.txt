11. INSPECT IDLE GEAR SHAFT OIL CLEARANCE
(a) Using a micrometer, measure the idle gear shaft
diameter.
Idle gear shaft diameter:
22.987 to 23.000 mm (0.9050 to 0.9055 in.)
A109648
(b) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inside diameter
of the idle gear.
Idle gear inside diameter:
23.020 to 23.030 mm (0.9063 to 0.9067 in.)
(c) Subtract the idle gear shaft diameter measurement
from the idle gear inside diameter measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
0.020 to 0.043 mm (0.0008 to 0.0017 in.) EM
Maximum oil clearance:
0.093 mm (0.0037 in.)
A120673
If the thrust oil clearance is greater than the
maximum, replace the idle gear shaft and idle gear.
12. INSPECT NO. 1 CHAIN TENSIONER ASSEMBLY
(a) Move the stopper plate upward to release the lock.
Push the plunger and check that it moves smoothly.
Plunger
If necessary, replace the chain tensioner assembly.

13. INSPECT NO. 2 CHAIN TENSIONER ASSEMBLY
(a) Check that the plunger moves smoothly.
(b) Measure the worn depth of the chain tensioner.
Maximum depth:
Depth
0.9 mm (0.035 in.)
If the depth is greater than the maximum, replace
the chain tensioner assembly.
