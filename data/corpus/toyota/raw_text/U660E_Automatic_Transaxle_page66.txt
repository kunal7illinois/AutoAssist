AX–66
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
Transmission Fluid Temperature Sensor "A"
DTC P0711
Performance
DESCRIPTION
The ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) temperature sensor converts the fluid temperature into a
AX
resistance value for use by the TCM.
Resistance
Acceptabele range
Temperature
G031389E15
The TCM applies a voltage to the temperature sensor through terminal OIL of the TCM.
The sensor resistance changes with the transmission fluid temperature. As the temperature becomes
higher, the sensor resistance decreases.
One terminal of the sensor is grounded so that the sensor resistance decreases and the voltage goes
down as the temperature becomes higher.
The TCM calculates the fluid temperature based on the voltage signal.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
Both (a) and (b) are detected: (2-trip detection logic)
(a) Intake air and engine coolant temps. are more
than -10°C (14°F) at engine start.
P0711 Transmission wire (ATF temperature sensor)
(b) After normal driving for over 16 min. and 40 sec.
and 5 mile (8 km) or more, ATF temp. is less than
20°C (68°F)
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
This DTC indicates that there is a problem with output signals from the automatic transmission fluid (ATF)
temperature sensor (TFT sensor) and that the sensor itself is defective. The ATF temperature sensor
converts the ATF temperature into an electrical resistance value. Based on the resistance, the TCM
determines the ATF temperature and detects an open or short in the ATF temperature circuit or a fault of
the ATF temperature sensor.
After running the vehicle for a certain period, the ATF temperature should increase. If the ATF
temperature is below 20°C (68°F) after running the vehicle for a certain period, the TCM interprets this as
a fault, and turns on the MIL.
