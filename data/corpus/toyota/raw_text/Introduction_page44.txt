SHORT (a) If the wire harness is ground shorted (Fig. 5), locate
the section by conducting a resistance check with

HINT:
Measure the resistance while lightly shaking the
wire harness vertically and horizontally. If your
results match the examples above, an open
circuit exists between terminal 1 of connector A
and terminal 1 of connector C.
(2) Disconnect connector B and measure the

4. CHECK AND REPLACE ECU
NOTICE:
• The connector should not be disconnected from
the ECU. Perform the inspection from the
backside of the connector on the wire harness
side.
• When no measuring condition is specified,
perform the inspection with the engine stopped
and the ignition switch on.
• Check that the connectors are fully seated. Check
for loose, corroded or broken wires.
