2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
Under closed-loop fuel control, fuel injection volumes that deviate from those estimated by the ECM
cause changes in the long-term fuel trim compensation value. The long-term fuel trim is adjusted when
there are persistent deviations in the short-term fuel trim values. Deviations from the ECM's estimated fuel
injection volumes also affect the average fuel trim learning value, which is a combination of the average
short-term fuel trim (fuel feedback compensation value) and the average long-term fuel trim (learning
value of the air-fuel ratio). If the average fuel trim learning value exceeds the malfunction threshold, the
ECM interprets this as a fault in the fuel system and sets a DTC.
Example:
The average fuel trim learning value is +35 % or more or -35 % or less, the ECM interprets this as a fuel
system malfunction.
