POWER STEERING – VANE PUMP (for 2AZ-FE)
3. INSPECT FLOW CONTROL VALVE ASSEMBLY
(a) Coat the flow control valve assembly with power
steering fluid and check that it falls smoothly into the
flow control valve due to its own weight.
If the control valve does not fall into the hole
smoothly, replace the vane pump assembly.
C132030
(b) Check the flow control valve assembly for leakage.
Compressed Air
Close one of the holes and apply compressed air,
392 to 490 kPa (4 to 5 kgf/cm2, 57 to 71 psi), into
the opposite side hole, and confirm that air does not
come out from the end holes.
If air leaks, replace the vane pump assembly.
C132031E01
4. INSPECT FLOW CONTROL VALVE COMPRESSION
SPRING
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the free length of
the flow control valve compression spring. PS
Minimum free length:
29.2 mm (1.150 in.)
If the length is less than the minimum, replace the
Vernier Caliper
vane pump assembly.
5. INSPECT PRESSURE PORT UNION
C132032E01 If the union seat in the pressure port union is severely
damaged, replace the vane pump assembly.
6. INSPECT TOTAL PRELOAD
(a) Check that the pump rotates smoothly without
abnormal noise.
(b) Temporarily install the service bolt.
Recommended service bolt:
Thread diameter:
10 mm (0.39 in.)
Service Bolt Thread pitch:
1.25 mm (0.0492 in.)
Bolt length:
C053369E10
50 mm (1.97 in.)
(c) Using a torque wrench, check the pump rotating
torque.
Rotating torque:
0.27 N*m (2.8 kgf*cm, 2.4 in.*lbf) or less
If the rotating torque is not as specified, check the
vane pump housing oil seal.
