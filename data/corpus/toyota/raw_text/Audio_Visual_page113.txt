AUDIO / VISUAL – AUDIO AND VISUAL SYSTEM
Sound Signal Circuit between Radio Receiver and Stereo Jack Adapter
DESCRIPTION
The stereo jack adapter sends an external device sound signal to the radio receiver through this circuit.
The sound signal that has been sent is amplified by the stereo component amplifier or radio receiver, and
then is sent to the speakers.
If there is an open or short in the circuit, sound cannot be heard from the speakers even if there is no
malfunction in the stereo component amplifier, radio receiver, or speakers.
