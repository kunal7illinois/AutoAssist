2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
2. The ECM sends a target duty-cycle control signal to the OCV. This control signal regulates the oil
pressure supplied to the VVT controller. The VVT controller can advance or retard the exhaust
camshaft.
If the difference between the target and actual exhaust valve timings is large, and changes in actual
exhaust valve timing are small, the ECM interprets this as the VVT controller stuck malfunction and
sets a DTC.
Example:
A DTC is set when the following conditions A, B and C are met:
(1)The difference between the target and actual exhaust valve timings is more than 5°CA
(Crankshaft Angle) and the condition continues for more than 4.5 seconds (Procedure "A").
(2)It takes 5 seconds or more to change the valve timing by 5°CA (Procedure "B").
(3)After above procedures "A" and "B" are met, the OCV is forcibly activated 63 times or more
(Procedure "C").
3. DTCs P0014 and P0024 (Advanced Cam Timing) are detected with 1 trip detection logic.
4. DTCs P0015 and P0025 (Retarded Cam Timing) are detected with 2 trip detection logic.

These DTCs indicate that the VVT controller cannot operate properly due to OCV malfunctions or the
presence of foreign objects in the OCV.
5. The monitor will not run unless the following conditions are met:
(a)The engine is warm (the engine coolant temperature is 75°C [167°F] or more).
(b)The vehicle has been driven at more than 40 mph (64 km/h) for 3 minutes.
(c)The engine has idled for 3 minutes.
