Bank 1 P0011 P0012
Bank 2 P0021 P0022

• Bank 1 refers to the bank that includes cylinder No. 1.

• Read freeze frame data using an intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
