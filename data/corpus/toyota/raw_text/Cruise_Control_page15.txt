CRUISE CONTROL – CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. DESCRIPTION
The ECU controls the cruise control system of the
vehicle. The data and DTCs relating to the cruise control
system can be read from the DLC3 of the vehicle. If
either DTC or CRUISE OK is not displayed on the multi-
information display on the combination meter when
checking for DTCs, there may be a problem with either
the combination meter or the CAN communication and
multiplex communication systems. Use the intelligent
tester to check and solve the problem.
2. CHECK DLC3
(a) The ECU uses the ISO 15765-4 for communication
CG SG CANH SIL
protocol. The terminal arrangement of the DLC3
complies with SAE J1962 and matches the ISO
15765-4 format.

NOTICE:
CC
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
(b) Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the
DLC3, turn the ignition switch on (IG), and attempt
to use the tester. If the display indicates that a
communication error has occurred, there is a
problem with either the vehicle or the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
of the original vehicle.
