NAVIGATION – NAVIGATION SYSTEM
Operation Description
The radio and navigation assembly calculates the current vehicle
position (direction and current position) using the direction deviation
Vehicle Position Calculation
signal from the gyro sensor and the running distance signal from the
vehicle speed sensor and creates the driving route.
The radio and navigation assembly displays the vehicle track on the
Map Display Processing map by processing the vehicle position data, vehicle running track,
and map data from the map disc.
The map data from the map disc is compared to the vehicle position
Map Matching and running track data. Then, the vehicle position is matched with the
nearest road.
The vehicle position is matched to the position measured by GPS.
Then, the measurement position data from the GPS unit is compared
GPS Correction
with the vehicle position and running track data. If the position is
widely different, the GPS measurement position is used.
The running distance signal from the vehicle speed sensor includes
the error caused by tire wear and slippage between the tires and road
surface. Distance correction is performed to account for this. The
Distance Correction
radio and navigation assembly automatically offsets the running
distance signal to make up for the difference between it and the
distance data of the map. The offset is automatically updated.
Navigation is performed even where the GPS
radio wave does not reach.
