INSPECTION
1. INSPECT BRAKE CYLINDER AND PISTON
(a) Inspect the cylinder bore and the piston for rust or
scoring. If necessary, replace the rear disc brake
cylinder assembly and piston.
2. INSPECT PAD LINING THICKNESS
(a) Using a ruler, measure the pad lining thickness.
Standard thickness:
11.0 mm (0.433 in.)
Minimum thickness:
1.0 mm (0.039 in.)
If the pad lining thickness is less than the minimum,
replace the brake pads.
HINT:
Be sure to check wear of the front disc after
C132815
replacing the brake pad with a new one.
3. INSPECT NO. 1 REAR DISC BRAKE PAD SUPPORT

PLATE
HINT:
Inspect the No. 2 rear disc brake pad support plate using
the same procedure with the No. 1 rear disc brake pad
support plate.
5. INSPECT DISC THICKNESS
(a) Using a micrometer, measure the disc thickness.
Standard thickness:
10.0 mm (0.390 in.)
Micrometer Minimum thickness:
8.5 mm (0.334 in.)
If the disc thickness is less than the minimum,
replace the rear disc.
6. INSPECT DISC RUNOUT
C132819E01 (a) Install the rear disc.
(b) Temporarily fasten the rear disc with the 3 hub nuts.
Torque:103 N*m (1,050 kgf*cm, 76 ft.*lbf)
(c) Using a dial indicator, measure the disc runout 10
Dial Indicator mm (0.39 in.) away from the outer edge of the rear
disc.
Maximum disc runout:
0.15 mm (0.0059 in.)
