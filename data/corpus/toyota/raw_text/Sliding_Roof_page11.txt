SLIDING ROOF – SLIDING ROOF SYSTEM
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. DESCRIPTION
(a) Sliding roof system data and Diagnostic Trouble
Codes (DTCs) can be read through the vehicle's
Data Link Connector 3 (DLC3). When the system
seems to be malfunctioning, use the intelligent
tester to check for malfunctions and perform repairs.
2. CHECK DLC3
HINT:
CG SG CANH SIL The ECU uses ISO 15765-4 for communication. The
terminal arrangement of the DLC3 complies with SAE
J1962 and matches the ISO 15765-4 format. If the result
is not as specified, the DLC3 may have a malfunction.
Repair or replace the harness and connector.

NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the vehicle
as is for at least 1 minute and do not operate the
ignition switch, any other switches or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have a
malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the DLC3,
turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to use the
tester. If the display indicates that a communication error
has occurred, there is a problem either with the vehicle
or with the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3 of the
original vehicle.
• If communication is still not possible when the tester
is connected to another vehicle, the problem may be
in the tester itself. Consult the Service Department
listed in the tester's instruction manual.
