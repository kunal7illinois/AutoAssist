ES–145
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Malfunctioning areas can be identified by performing the A/F CONTROL function provided in the ACTIVE
TEST. The A/F CONTROL function can help to determine whether the Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor, Heated
Oxygen (HO2) sensor and other potential trouble areas are malfunctioning.
The following instructions describe how to conduct the A/F CONTROL operation using the intelligent
tester.
(a)Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b)Start the engine and turn the tester ON.
(c)Warm up the engine at an engine speed of 2,500 rpm for approximately 90 seconds.
(d)On the tester, select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST / A/
F CONTROL.
(e)Perform the A/F CONTROL operation with the engine idling (press the RIGHT or LEFT button to
change the fuel injection volume).
(f) Monitor the voltage outputs of the A/F and HO2 sensors (AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2) displayed on the
ES
tester.
HINT:
• The A/F CONTROL operation lowers the fuel injection volume by 12.5 % or increases the injection
volume by 25 %.
• The sensors react in accordance with increases and decreases in the fuel injection volume.

NOTICE:
The A/F sensor has an output delay of a few seconds and the HO2 sensor has a maximum output
delay of approximately 20 seconds.
