If a DTC was displayed in the initial DTC check, the
problem may have occurred in a wire harness or
connector in that circuit in the past. Check the wire
harness and connectors.

The problem still occurs in a place other than the diagnostic
circuit (the DTC displayed first is either for a past problem or
a secondary problem).
4. SYMPTOM SIMULATION
HINT:
The most difficult case in troubleshooting is when no
problem symptoms occur. In such a case, a thorough
problem analysis must be carried out. A simulation of the
same or similar conditions and environment in which the
problem occurred in the customer's vehicle should be
carried out. No matter how much skill or experience a
technician has, troubleshooting without confirming the
problem symptoms will lead to important repairs being
overlooked and mistakes or delays.
For example:
With a problem that only occurs when the engine is
cold or as a result of vibration caused by the road
during driving, the problem can never be
determined if the symptoms are being checked on
a stationary vehicle or a vehicle with a warmed-up
engine. Vibration, heat or water penetration
(moisture) are difficult to reproduce. The symptom
simulation tests below are effective substitutes for
the conditions and can be applied to a stationary
vehicle. Important points in the symptom
