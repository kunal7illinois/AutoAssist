2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
3. 2 TRIP DETECTION LOGIC
When a malfunction is first detected, the malfunction is
temporarily stored in the ECM memory (1st trip). If the
same malfunction is detected during the next
subsequent drive cycle, the MIL is illuminated (2nd trip).
4. FREEZE FRAME DATA
Freeze frame data records the engine conditions (fuel
system, calculated engine load, engine coolant
temperature, fuel trim, engine speed, vehicle speed,
etc.) when malfunctions are detected. When
troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if
the vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was
warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich,
ES
and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.

CAUTION:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the vehicle
as is for at least 1 minute and do not operate the
ignition switch, any other switches or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have a
malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
The DLC3 is the interface prepared for reading various
data from the vehicle's ECM. After connecting the cable
of the intelligent tester to the CAN VIM, turn the ignition
switch ON and turn the tester ON. If a communication
failure message is displayed on the tester screen (on the
tester: UNABLE TO CONNECT TO VEHICLE), a
problem exists in either the vehicle or tester. In order to
identify the location of the problem, connect the tester to
another vehicle.
