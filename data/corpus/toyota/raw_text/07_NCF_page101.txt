EG-74 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
Fail-safe of Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor
The accelerator pedal position sensor comprises two (Main, Sub) sensor circuits.
(cid:3) If a malfunction occurs in either of the sensor circuits, the ECM detects the abnormal signal voltage
difference between these two sensor circuits and switches into the limp mode. In the limp mode, the
remaining circuit is used to calculate the accelerator pedal opening, in order to operate the vehicle under
limp mode control.

(cid:3) If both circuits malfunction, the ECM detects the abnormal signal voltage from these two sensor circuits
and discontinues the throttle control. At this time, the vehicle can be driven within its idling range.
