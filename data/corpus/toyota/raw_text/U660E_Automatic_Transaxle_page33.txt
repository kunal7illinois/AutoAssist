U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
PROBLEM SYMPTOMS TABLE
HINT:
If a normal code is displayed during the diagnostic trouble
code check although the problem or symptom still occurs,
check the electrical circuits for each symptom in the order
given in the charts on the following pages. Proceed to the AX
page given in the chart and perform troubleshooting.
The Matrix Chart is divided into 2 chapters.
Chapter 1:
Refer to the table below when the trouble cause is considered
to be electrical.
If the instruction "Proceed to next circuit inspection shown on
matrix chart" is given in the flow chart of each circuit, proceed
to the circuit with the next highest number in the table to
continue the check.
If the trouble still occurs even though there are no
abnormalities in any of the other circuits, check and replace
the TCM.
Chapter 2:
Chapter 2 covers on and off vehicle repair of the transaxle.
Contents specified in the table below may not match while
fail-safe control is operating.
