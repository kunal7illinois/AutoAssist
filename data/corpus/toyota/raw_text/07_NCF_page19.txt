
Bluetooth Hands-free System
(cid:3) Bluetooth  is a high-speed wireless data communication system that uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band
prescribed by the Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group), with a communication speed of 1 Mbps. By
simply bringing a cellular phone that has been pre-registered on the audio head unit or the multi display
into the vehicle, the user can talk hands-free. Thus, it is no longer necessary to connect the telephone to
a hands-free connection device as in the past.
(cid:3) A Bluetooth  hands-free system, which enables the user to make and receive calls and talk hands-free by
operating the switches on the steering pad or the screen display, is provided on the audio head unit.
(cid:3) A Bluetooth  hands-free system consists of an audio head unit, a microphone in the overhead console,
and the switches on the steering pad.
