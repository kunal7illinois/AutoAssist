BE-142 BODY ELECTRICAL - SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM
(cid:3)AIRBAG FOR FRONTAL COLLISION
1. General
(cid:1) In conjunction with their impact absorbing structure for frontal collisions, the driver and front passenger
dual-stage SRS airbags and the driver knee airbag deploy simultaneously, and are supplements to the seat
belts. The driver and front passenger dual-stage SRS airbags have been designed to help reduce injuries
to the head and chest in the event of a frontal collision. The driver knee airbag restrict the lower parts of
the occupant’s body, thus enhancing the excellent passenger protection provided by the seat belt and front
airbag.
(cid:1) The deceleration sensor is enclosed in the front airbag sensor. Due to the deceleration of the vehicle during
a front collision, a distortion is created in the sensor and converted into an electrical signal. Accordingly,
the extent of the initial collision can be detected in detail.
