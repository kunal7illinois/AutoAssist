MIRROR – INNER REAR VIEW MIRROR
CALIBRATION
1. SELECT COMPASS DISPLAY MODE
(a) The COMP switch allows you to select the Display
or Non-display mode of the compass.
2. SET ZONE
(a) Deviation between the "magnetic north" and "actual
north" differs depending on the location. Therefore,
MI
adjustment of the magnetism is required. Since the
magnetic condition differs depending on the area
where the vehicle is used, it is necessary for each
user to set the zone (Refer to Compass Zone Map).
The zone setting can be changed using the COMP
switch of the inner mirror.
3. PERFORM CALIBRATION
(a) Because each vehicle has its own magnetic field,
calibration should be performed for each vehicle.
This compass function is used when storing the
record of the vehicle's magnetic field.
4. WHEN COMPASS IS MAGNETIZED
(a) A compass could be magnetized during shipping by
vessels or freight cars. Therefore, make sure to
perform calibration and ensure that calibration is
performed properly before delivery. If it cannot be
done (cannot be completed in spite of driving
around several times), it may be caused by
magnetization. Demagnetize the vehicle using a
demagnetizer and perform calibration again.
