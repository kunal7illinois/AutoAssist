2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(a) EVAP VSV stuck open
In operation C, the vacuum pump creates negative pressure (vacuum) in the EVAP (Evaporative
Emission) system. The EVAP system pressure is then measured by the ECM using the pressure
sensor. If the stabilized system pressure is higher than [second 0.02 inch leak pressure standard
x 0.2], the ECM interprets this as the EVAP VSV (Vacuum Switching Valve) being stuck open.
The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
