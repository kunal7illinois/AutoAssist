2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
COMPONENT OPERATING RANGE
VTA1 voltage 0.69 to 4.05 V
VTA2 voltage 2.25 to 4.8 V
FAIL-SAFE
When any of these DTCs, as well as other DTCs relating to ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System)
malfunctions, are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe mode, the ECM cuts the current to
the throttle actuator off, and the throttle valve is returned to a 6° throttle angle by the return spring. The
ECM then adjusts the engine output by controlling the fuel injection (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition
timing, in accordance with the accelerator pedal opening angle, to allow the vehicle to continue at a
minimal speed. If the accelerator pedal is depressed gently, the vehicle can be driven slowly.

INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data
can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine was
warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the time of
a malfunction (See page ES-45).

#2)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) and turn the intelligent
tester on.
