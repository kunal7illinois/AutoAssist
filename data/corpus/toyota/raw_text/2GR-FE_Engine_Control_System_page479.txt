DESCRIPTION
The MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) is used to indicate vehicle malfunctions detected by the ECM.
When the ignition switch is turned on (IG), power is supplied to the MIL circuit, and the ECM provides the
circuit ground which illuminates the MIL.
The MIL operation can be checked visually: When the ignition switch is first turned on (IG), the MIL should
be illuminated and should then turn off. If the MIL remains illuminated or is not illuminated, conduct the
following troubleshooting procedure using the intelligent tester.
