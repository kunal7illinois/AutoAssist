1. Clearing zero point calibration data.
Front wheel alignment adjustment
2. Yaw rate and acceleration sensor zero point calibration.
2. OBTAIN ZERO POINT OF YAW RATE AND
ACCELERATION SENSOR (INTELLIGENT TESTER)
NOTICE:
• While obtaining the zero point, keep the vehicle
stationary and do not vibrate, tilt, move, or shake
BC
it. (Do not start the engine.)
• Be sure to perform this procedure on a level
surface (with an inclination of less than 1 degree).
(a) Clear the zero point calibration data.
(1) Turn the ignition switch off.
(2) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(3) Check that the steering wheel is centered and
move the shift lever to the P position (A/T) or
apply the parking brake (M/T).
