EG-70 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
e. Purge VSV Monitor
1)After completing an EVAP leak check, the ECM turns ON (open) the purge VSV with the leak
detection pump actuated, and introduces the atmospheric pressure from the intake manifold to the
canister.
2)If the pressure change at this time is within the normal range, the ECM determines the condition to
be normal.
3)If the pressure is out of the normal range, the ECM will stop the purge VSV monitor and store DTC
P0441 in its memory.
