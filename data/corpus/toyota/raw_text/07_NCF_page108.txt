ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-81
3. Cylinder Head
(cid:1) The cylinder head structure has been simplified by separating the cam journal portion (camshaft housing)
from the cylinder head.
(cid:1) The cylinder head, which is made of aluminum, contains a pentroof-type combustion chamber. The spark
plug is located in the center of the combustion chamber in order to improve the engine’s anti-knocking
performance.
(cid:1) The intake ports are on the inside and the exhaust ports on the outside of the left and right banks
respectively.
(cid:1) Upright intake ports are used to improve the intake efficiency.
(cid:1) A taper squish combustion chamber is used to improve anti-knocking performance and intake efficiency.
In addition, engine performance and fuel economy have been improved.
(cid:1) The siamese type intake port is used to reduce the overall surface area of the intake port walls. This
prevents the fuel from adhering onto the intake port walls, thus reducing HC exhaust emissions.
