SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM – AIRBAG SYSTEM
DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE CHART
If a trouble code is displayed during the DTC check, check
the circuit listed for the code in the table below (refer to the
appropriate page).
HINT:
• When the SRS warning light remains on and the DTC
output is the normal system code, a voltage source drop is
likely to occur. This malfunction is not stored in the
memory by the center airbag sensor assembly. If the
power source voltage returns to normal, the SRS warning
light will automatically go off.
• When 2 or more codes are indicated, the code with the
lower number appears first.
• If a code is not listed on the display chart, the center airbag
sensor assembly may have failed.
• In the case of any malfunction concerning an open circuit,
short to ground, or short to B+ due to a squib, other trouble
codes may not be detected. In this case, repair the
malfunction currently indicated and then perform
malfunction diagnosis again.
• Mark in the check mode column:
*1: DTC is not corresponding to the check mode.
*2: DTC is corresponding to the check mode.
