This brake booster consists of the conventional type brake booster to which a brake assist mechanism has
been added. During a normal brake operation, the function of the brake booster is the same as that of the
conventional type. The major difference in construction between this booster and the conventional type one
is that the slide valve and the slide valve hook are added in the air valve in this booster.
