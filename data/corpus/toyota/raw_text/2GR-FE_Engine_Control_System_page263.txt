P043E 0.02 inch orifice clogged P043E, P043F, P2401, P2402, P2419
are present when one of the following
P043F 0.02 inch orifice high-flow
conditions is met during key-off EVAP
P2401 Vacuum pump stuck OFF monitor • Pump module
P2402 Vacuum pump stuck ON • Reference orifice clogged • Connector/wire While
• Reference orifice high-flow harness (Pump ignition 2 trip
• Leak detection pump OFF module - ECM) switch OFF
Vent valve stuck open malfunction • ECM
P2419 (vent) • Leak detection pump ON
malfunction
• Vent valve ON (close) malfunction
HINT:
The 0.02 inch orifice is located inside the pump module.
DESCRIPTION
The circuit description can be found in the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) System (See page ES-400).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
Refer to the EVAP System (See page ES-400).
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
5 hours*1 after the ignition switch is turned off, the electric vacuum pump creates negative pressure
(vacuum) in the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) system. The ECM monitors for leaks and actuator
malfunctions based on the EVAP pressure.
HINT:
*1: If the engine coolant temperature is not below 35°C (95°F) 5 hours after the ignition switch is turned off,
the monitor check starts 2 hours later. If it is still not below 35°C (95°F) 7 hours after the ignition switch is
turned off, the monitor check starts 2.5 hours later.
Sequence Operations Descriptions Duration
Activated by soak timer, 5 hours (7 or 9.5 hours) after ignition switch
- ECM activation -
turned off.
