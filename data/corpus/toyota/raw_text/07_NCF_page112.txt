ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-85
8. Crankshaft Bearing and Crankshaft Bearing Cap
(cid:1) The crankshaft bearing is made of aluminum alloy.
(cid:1) Similar to the connecting rod bearings, the lining surface of the crankshaft bearings is micro-grooved to
realize an optimal amount of oil clearance. As a result, cold-engine cranking performance is improved and
engine vibration is reduced.
(cid:1) The upper main bearing has an oil groove around its inside circumference.
(cid:1) The crankshaft bearing caps are tightened using 4 plastic-region tightening bolts for each journal. In
addition, each cap is tightened laterally to improve its reliability.
