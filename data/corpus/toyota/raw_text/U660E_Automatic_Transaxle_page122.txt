DTC P0990
AX
cuit High
DESCRIPTION
ATF pressure switch No. 3 is installed in the lock-up solenoid ATF output passage and is used to detect a
malfunction in the lock-up solenoid.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
Transmission fluid pressure switch No. 3 is OFF when
P0989 lock-up occurs in response to a lock-up request (2 trip
detection logic).
• ATF temperature sensor assembly (ATF pressure
When both of the following are detected (2 trip
switch No. 3)
detection logic):
• Transmission wire
• Transmission fluid pressure switch No. 3 is ON
P0990 • TCM
when lock-up does not occur.
• Lock-up does not occur when shift solenoid valve
(SLU) is requested to turn off in the lock-up range.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The TCM illuminates the MIL and stores the DTC when the TCM detects that the ATF pressure switch is
OFF with the lock-up solenoid ON or when the TCM detects that the ATF pressure switch is ON with the
lock-up solenoid OFF.
