PRECAUTIONS FOR REPAIRING BODY
STRUCTURE PANELS
1. HEAT REPAIR FOR BODY STRUCTURE
PANELS
Toyota prohibits the use of the heat repair method on body
structure panels when repairing a vehicle damaged in a col-
lision.
Panels that have high strength and rigidity, as well as a long
life span for the automobile body are in high demand.
At Toyota, in order to fulfill these requirements, we use high
tensile strength steel sheets and rust preventive steel
sheets on the body. High tensile steel sheets are made with
F33014
alloy additives and a special heat treatment in order to im-
prove their strength.
To prevent the occurrence of rust for a long period of time,
the surface of the steel is coated with a zinc alloy.
If body structure parts are heat repaired with an acetylene
torch or other heating source, the crystalline organization of
the steel sheet will change and their strength of the steel
sheet will be reduced. The ability of the body to resist rust is
significantly lowered as well since the rust resistant zinc
coating is destroyed by heat and the steel sheet surface is
oxidized.
2. STRUCTURE PANEL KINKS
A sharp deformation angle on a panel that cannot be re-
turned to its original shape by pulling or hammering is
called a kink.
Structural parts are designed to perform in their original
shape. If parts are deformed in an accident, or if the de-
formed parts are repaired and reused, the parts may be un-
able to perform as intended.
It is necessary to replace the part where the kink has oc-
curred.
