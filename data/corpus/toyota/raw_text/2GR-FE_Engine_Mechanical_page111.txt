2GR-FE ENGINE MECHANICAL – ENGINE UNIT
(b) Inspect the main journals.
(1) Using a micrometer, measure the diameter of
each main journal.
Standard journal diameter:
60.988 to 61.000 mm (2.4011 to 2.4016 in.)
If the diameter is not as specified, check the oil
clearance. If necessary, replace the crankshaft.
(2) Check each main journal for taper and out-of-
round as shown in the illustration.
Maximum taper and out-of-round:
A109694
0.02 mm (0.0008 in.)
If the taper and out-of-round is greater than the
maximum, replace the crankshaft.
(c) Inspect the crank pin.
(1) Using a micrometer, measure the diameter of
each crank pin.
Crankshaft pin diameter:
52.992 to 53.000 mm (2.0863 to 2.0866 in.)

If the diameter is not as specified, check the oil
clearance. If necessary, replace the crankshaft.
(2) Check each crank pin for taper and out-of-
round as shown in the illustration.
Maximum taper and out-of-round:
A109695
0.02 mm (0.0008 in.)
If the taper and out-of-round is greater than the
maximum, replace the crankshaft.
42. INSPECT CRANKSHAFT OIL CLEARANCE
(a) Check the crank journal and bearing for pitting and
scratches.
(b) Install the crankshaft bearing (See page EM-113).
(c) Place the crankshaft on the cylinder block.
(d) Lay a strip of Plastigage across each journal.
Plastigage
(e) Examine the front marks and numbers and install
the bearing caps on the cylinder block.
HINT:
A number is marked on each main bearing cap to
indicate the installation position.
(f) Install the main bearing cap (See page EM-113).
NOTICE:
Do not turn the crankshaft.
(g) Remove the main bearing caps (See page EM-64).
A122109E01
(h) Measure the Plastigage at its widest point.
Standard oil clearance:
Plastigage
0.026 to 0.047 mm (0.0010 to 0.0019 in.)
Maximum oil clearance:
0.050 mm (0.0020 in.)
If the oil clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the bearings. If necessary, replace the
crankshaft.
NOTICE:
Completely remove the Plastigage after the
A131830E01
measurement.
