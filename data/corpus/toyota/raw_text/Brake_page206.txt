(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) again and check that no
CAN communication system DTC is output.
(e) Check if DTCs for zero point calibration of the yaw rate
sensor undone (C1210/36) or for zero point calibration of
the acceleration sensor undone (C1336/39) are output.

2 CHECK YAW RATE AND ACCELERATION SENSOR INSTALLATION
(a) Turn the ignition switch off.
(b) Check that the yaw rate and acceleration sensor has
been installed properly (See page BC-448).
OK:
The sensor is tightened to the specified torque.
The sensor is not tilted.
NG INSTALL YAW RATE AND ACCELERATION
