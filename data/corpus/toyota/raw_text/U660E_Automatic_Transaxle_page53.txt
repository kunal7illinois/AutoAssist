AX–53
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE CHART
If a DTC is displayed during the DTC check, check the parts
listed in the table below and proceed to the page given.
HINT:
• *1: MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) comes on
• *2: "DTC stored" mark means TCM memorizes the trouble AX
code if the TCM detects that the DTC detection condition
is satisfied.
• A DTC may be output when the clutch, brake and gear
components, etc. inside the automatic transaxle are
damaged.
