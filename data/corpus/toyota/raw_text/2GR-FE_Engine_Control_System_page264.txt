ES–264
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Sequence Operations Descriptions Duration
Vent valve turned OFF (vent) and EVAP system pressure measured
Atmospheric pressure by ECM in order to register atmospheric pressure.
A 10 seconds
measurement If pressure in EVAP system is not between 70 kPa and 110 kPa (525
mmHg and 825 mmHg), ECM cancels EVAP system monitor.
In order to determine 0.02 inch leak pressure standard, vacuum pump
First 0.02 inch leak pressure
B creates negative pressure (vacuum) through 0.02 inch orifice and then 60 seconds
measurement
ECM checks if vacuum pump and vent valve operate normally.
Vent valve turned ON (closed) to shut EVAP system.
Negative pressure (vacuum) is created in EVAP system, and EVAP
EVAP system pressure system pressure then measured. Write down measured value as it will
C 15 minutes*2
measurement be used in leak check.
If EVAP pressure does not stabilize within 15 minutes, ECM cancels
EVAP system monitor.
Purge VSV is opened and then EVAP system pressure is measured
D Purge VSV monitor by ECM. 10 seconds
Large increase indicates normal.
ES
After second 0.02 inch leak pressure measurement, leak check is
performed by comparing first and second 0.02 inch leak pressure
Second 0.02 inch leak pressure
E standards. 60 seconds
measurement
If stabilized system pressure is higher than second 0.02 inch leak
pressure standard, ECM determines that EVAP system leaking.
Atmospheric pressure is measured and then monitoring result is
F Final check -
recorded by ECM.
*2: If there is only a small amount of fuel in the fuel tank, stabilizing the EVAP pressure takes longer than
usual.
