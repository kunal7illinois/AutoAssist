AX–59
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
DTC P0560 System Voltage
DESCRIPTION
The battery supplies electricity to the TCM even when the ignition switch is off. This power allows the TCM
to store data such as DTC history, freeze frame data and fuel trim values. If the battery voltage falls below
AX
a minimum level, these memories are cleared and the TCM determines that there is a malfunction in the
power supply circuit. When the engine is next started, the TCM will illuminate the MIL and set the DTC.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
