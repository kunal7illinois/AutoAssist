DEFINITION OF TERMS
Terms Definition
Monitor Description Description of what ECM monitors and how to detect malfunctions (monitoring purpose and
its details).
Related DTCs A group of diagnostic trouble codes that are output by ECM based on the same
malfunction detection logic.
Typical Enabling Condition Preconditions that allow ECM to detect malfunctions.
With all preconditions satisfied, ECM sets DTC when monitored value(s) exceeds
malfunction threshold(s).
Sequence of Operation Order of monitor priority, applied if multiple sensors and components are involved in single
malfunction detection process.
Each sensor and component monitored in turn and not monitored until previous detection
operation is completed.
Required Sensor/Components Sensors and components used by ECM to detect each malfunction.
Frequency of Operation Number of times ECM checks for each malfunction during each driving cycle.
ES
"Once per driving cycle" means that ECM checks for malfunctions only once in single
driving cycle.
"Continuous" means that ECM checks for malfunctions whenever enabling conditions are
met.
Duration Minimum time for which ECM must detect continuous deviation in monitored value(s) in
order to set DTC. Timing begins when Typical Enabling Conditions are met.
Malfunction Thresholds Value, beyond which, ECM determines malfunctions exist and sets DTCs.
MIL Operation Timing of MIL illumination after a malfunction is detected.
"Immediate" means that ECM illuminates MIL as soon as a malfunction is detected.
"2 driving cycle" means that ECM illuminates MIL if the same malfunction is detected twice
during next sequential driving cycle.
