2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(d) Warm up the Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor at an engine
speed of 2,500 rpm for 90 seconds.
(e) On the tester, enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / SNAPSHOT / MANUAL
SNAPSHOT / USER DATA / AFS B1 S1 or AFS B2 S1
and ENGINE SPD.
(f) Check the A/F sensor voltage three times, when the
engine is in each of the following conditions:
(1) While idling (check for at least 30 seconds)
(2) At an engine speed of approximately 2,500 rpm
(without any sudden changes in engine speed)
(3) Raise the engine speed to 4,000 rpm and then
quickly release the accelerator pedal so that the
throttle valve is fully closed.

• If the output voltage of the A/F sensor remains at
approximately 3.3 V (see Malfunction Condition diagram)
under any conditions, including those above, the A/F
sensor may have an open circuit. (this will also happen if
the A/F sensor heater has an open circuit.)
• If the output voltage of the A/F sensor remains at either
approximately 3.8 V or more, or 2.8 V or less (see
Malfunction Condition diagram) under any conditions,
including those above, the A/F sensor may have a short
circuit.
