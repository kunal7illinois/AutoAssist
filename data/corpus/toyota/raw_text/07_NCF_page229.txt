CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE CH-65
5. Clutch to Clutch Pressure Control
(cid:3) Clutch to clutch pressure control is used for shift control. As a result, shift control in the 2nd gear or above
is possible without using the one-way clutch, and the automatic transaxle has been made lightweight and
compact.
(cid:3) Using the fluid pressure circuit, which enables the clutches and brakes (C1, C2, B1 and B3) to be controlled
independently, and the high flow SL1, SL2, SL3 and SL4 linear solenoid valves, which directly control
the line pressure, the ECT ECU controls each clutch and brake accordingly with the optimum fluid
pressures and timings in accordance with the information transmitted by the sensors, and then shifts the
gears. As a result, highly responsive and excellent shift characteristics have been realized.
