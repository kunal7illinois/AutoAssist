NOTICE:
Do not reconnect the disconnected connectors until
this inspection is complete because there may be a
short to B+ in 2 or more CAN bus wires.
Result
Symptom Proceed to
The resistance between terminals 6 (CANH) and 16 (BAT), or the resistance between 14
(CANL) and 16 (BAT) is still below 6 kΩ when all the specified connectors are disconnected
OK
from the No. 1 CAN J/C. (There is a short to B+ in the CAN main bus wires between the No. 1
CAN J/C and No. 2 CAN J/C.)
The resistance between terminals 6 (CANH) and 16 (BAT), or the resistance between 14
(CANL) and 16 (BAT) becomes normal (6 kΩ or more) when a connector is disconnected
NG
from the No. 1 CAN J/C. (There is a short to B+ in one of the areas that relate to one or more
of the disconnected bus wires.)
(c) When there is a short to B+ in one or more of the bus
wires that connect to an ECU (or sensor):
