2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold
DTC P0420
(Bank 1)
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM uses sensors mounted in front of and behind the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) to
monitor its efficiency.
The first sensor, the Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor, sends pre-catalyst information to the ECM. The second
sensor, the Heated Oxygen (HO2) sensor, sends post-catalyst information to the ECM.
In order to detect any deterioration in the TWC, the ECM calculates the Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC)
of the TWC. This calculation is based on the voltage output of the HO2 sensor while performing active air-
fuel ratio control, rather than the conventional detecting method, which uses the locus ratio.
The OSC value is an indication of the oxygen storage capacity of the TWC. When the vehicle is being
ES
driven with a warm engine, active air-fuel ratio control is performed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds.
When it is performed, the ECM deliberately sets the air-fuel ratio to lean or rich levels. If the rich-lean
cycle of the HO2 sensor is long, the OSC becomes greater. There is a direct correlation between the
OSCs of the HO2 sensor and the TWC.
The ECM uses the OSC value to determine the state of the TWC. If any deterioration has occurred, it
illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
• Front exhaust pipe (with TWC)
OSC value smaller than standard value under active air-fuel • Gas leakage from exhaust system
