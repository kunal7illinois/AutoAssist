DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
Condition (a) or (b) continues for 2.0 seconds or more
• Short between VPA and VPA2 circuits
(1 trip detection logic):
P2138 • APP sensor
(a) Difference between VPA and VPA2 is 0.02 V or less
• ECM
(b) VPA is 0.4 V or less and VPA2 1.2 V or less
HINT:
When any of these DTCs are set, check the APP sensor voltage by entering the following menus on the
intelligent tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / ACCEL POS #1 and
ACCEL POS #2.

HINT:
• Accelerator pedal positions are expressed as voltages.
• AP denotes Accelerator Pedal.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
When either of the output voltages of VPA or VPA2 deviates from the standard range, or the difference
between the output voltages of the 2 sensor circuits is less than the threshold, the ECM determines that
there is a malfunction in the APP sensor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets a DTC.
Example:
When the output voltage of VPA drops below 0.4 V for more than 0.5 seconds when the accelerator
pedal is fully depressed, DTC P2122 is set.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 2 seconds after the engine is next
started.
MONITOR STRATEGY
P2120: Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor 1 range check
(fluctuating)
P2122: APP sensor 1 range check (low voltage)
P2123: APP sensor 1 range check (high voltage)

P2125: APP sensor 2 range check (fluctuating)
P2127: APP sensor 2 range check (low voltage)
P2128: APP sensor 2 range check (high voltage)
P2138: APP sensor range check (correlation)
