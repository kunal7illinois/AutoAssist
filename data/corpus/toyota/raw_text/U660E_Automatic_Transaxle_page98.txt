AX–98
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
Pressure Control Solenoid "B" Electrical (Shift
DTC P0778
Solenoid Valve SL2)
DESCRIPTION
Shifting from 1st to 6th is performed in combination with "ON" and "OFF" operation of the shift solenoid
AX
valves SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4 and SL which is controlled by the TCM. If an open or short circuit occurs in any
of the shift solenoid valves, the TCM controls the remaining normal shift solenoid valve to allow the
vehicle to be operated smoothly (See page AX-39).
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
The TCM checks for an open or short in the shift
solenoid valve SL2 circuit while driving and shifting
• Open or short in shift solenoid valve SL2 circuit
gears. (1-trip detection logic)
P0778 • Shift solenoid valve SL2
• Output signal duty equals to 100%.
• TCM
(NOTE: SL2 output signal duty is less than 100%
under normal condition.)
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
This DTC indicates an open or short in the shift solenoid valve SL2 circuit. The TCM commands gear
shifts by turning the shift solenoid valves on or off. When there is an open or short circuit in any of the shift
solenoid valve circuits, the TCM detects the problem and illuminates the MIL and stores the DTC. The
TCM also performs the fail-safe function and turns the other normal shift solenoid valves on or off. (In
case of an open or short circuit, the TCM stops sending current to the circuit.)
While driving and shifting gears, if the TCM detects an open or short in the shift solenoid valve SL2 circuit,
the TCM determines there is a malfunction (See page AX-39).
