NAVIGATION – NAVIGATION SYSTEM
(c) GPS navigation (Satellite navigation)
This method detects the absolute vehicle position
using radio waves from a GPS satellite.
* GPS satellites were launched by the U.S.
Department of Defence for military purposes.
Current longitude/latitude/altitude is determined using the radio wave arrival time from four satellites.

Number of satellites Measurement Description
Vehicle position cannot be obtained because
2 or less Measurement impossible
the number of satellites is not enough.
Vehicle position is obtained based on the
3 2-dimensional measurement is possible current longitude and latitude. (This is less
precise than 3-dimensional measurement.)
Vehicle position is obtained based on the
4 3-dimensional measurement is possible
current longitude, latitude and altitude.
