BE-100 BODY ELECTRICAL - SMART KEY SYSTEM
Step System Operation
After checking that the steering is in the unlocked condition, the main body ECU transmits a
o)
starter request (STSW) signal to the ECM.
The ECM receives this signal, outputs an ST relay (STAR) signal, and actuates the starter. (For
p)
details see the cranking hold function on page EG-132.)
The ECM and main body ECU both output the starter relay signal in order to actuate the starter.
q) Both the ECM and main body ECU output the signal in order to prevent situations where the
starter may fail to operate, such as when the battery voltage supplied to the ECM is low.
When the ECM judges from the engine speed that engine start is completed, it stops the starter
r)
relay (STAR) signal, and stops the starter.
The main body ECU receives this signal, checks that engine start is completed, and turns OFF
s)
the indicator light of the engine switch.
