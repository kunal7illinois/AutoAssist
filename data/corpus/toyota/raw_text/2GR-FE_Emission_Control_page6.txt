2GR-FE EMISSION CONTROL – EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM
ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. INSPECT FUEL CUT-OFF RPM
(a) Increase the engine speed to at least 3,500 rpm.
(b) Use a sound scope to check for injector operating
sounds.
(c) Check that when the throttle lever is released,
injector operating sounds stop momentarily (at
2,500 rpm) and then resume (at 1,400 rpm).
Standard
Item Specified Condition
Fuel cut off rpm 2,500 rpm
Fuel return rpm 1,400 rpm
2. CHECK AIR TIGHTNESS IN FUEL TANK AND FILLER
PIPE
(a) Disconnect the vent line hose from the fuel tank.
(b) Connect the pressure gauge to the fuel tank.
(c) Apply pressure to the fuel tank to create an internal
pressure of 4 kPa (41 gf/cm2, 0.58 psi).
(d) Check that the internal pressure of the fuel tank is
maintained for 1 minute.
(e) Check the connected portions of each hose and
pipe.
(f) Check the installed parts on the fuel tank.
EC If any malfunctions, damage or other problems are
found, replace the fuel tank and filler pipe.
(g) Reconnect the vent line hose to the fuel tank.

3. INSPECT FUEL CUT OFF VALVE AND FUEL CHECK
VALVE
(a) Disconnect the vent line hose from the fuel tank.
(b) Connect the pressure gauge to the fuel tank.
(c) Fill the fuel tank with fuel.
(d) Apply pressure of 4 kPa (41 gf/cm2, 0.58 psi) to the
vent port of the fuel tank.
HINT:
Check the amount of fuel in the fuel tank. When the
fuel tank is full, the float valve of the fill check valve
is closed and no air can pass through.
(e) Remove the fuel tank cap, and check that the
pressure drops.
If the pressure does not drop, replace the fuel tank
Fuel Tank Cap assembly.
(f) Reconnect the vent line hose to the fuel tank.
