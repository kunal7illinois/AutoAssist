• If DTC P0014 or P0015 is displayed, check the exhaust camshaft circuit for the bank 1 VVT system.
• Bank 1 refers to the bank that includes cylinder No. 1.
• If DTC P0024 or P0025 is displayed, check for exhaust camshaft circuit for the bank 2 VVT system.
• Bank 2 refers to the bank that does not include cylinder No. 1.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
