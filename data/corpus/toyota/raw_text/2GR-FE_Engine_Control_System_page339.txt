SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The Electronic Throttle Control System (ETCS) is composed of the throttle actuator, Throttle Position (TP)
sensor, Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor, and ECM. The ECM operates the throttle actuator to
regulate the throttle valve in response to driver inputs. The TP sensor detects the opening angle of the
throttle valve, and provides the ECM with feedback so that the throttle valve can be appropriately
controlled by the ECM.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
Throttle valve opening angle continues to vary greatly • ETCS
P2119
from target opening angle (1 trip detection logic) • ECM
ES
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM determines the actual opening angle of the throttle valve from the TP sensor signal. The actual
opening angle is compared to the target opening angle commanded by the ECM. If the difference
between these two values is outside the standard range, the ECM interprets this as a malfunction in the
ETCS. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, the DTC is set when the accelerator pedal is quickly
released (to close the throttle valve) after the engine speed reaches 5,000 rpm by fully depressing the
accelerator pedal (fully open the throttle valve).
