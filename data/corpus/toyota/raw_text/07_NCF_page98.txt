f. Repeat 0.02 in. Leak Pressure Measurement
1)While the ECM operates the leak detection pump, the purge VSV and vent valve turns off and a repeat
0.02 in. leak pressure measurement is performed.
2)The ECM compares the measured pressure with the pressure during EVAP leak check.
3)If the pressure during the EVAP leak check is below the measured value, the ECM determines that
there is no leakage.
4)If the pressure during the EVAP leak check is above the measured value, the ECM determines that
there is a small leak and stores DTC P0456 in its memory.
