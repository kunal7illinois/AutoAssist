DESCRIPTION
HINT:
If DTC P0014, P0015, P0024 or P0025 is present, check the VVT (Variable Valve Timing) system.
The Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system includes the ECM, OCV and VVT controller. The ECM sends a
target duty-cycle control signal to the OCV. This control signal regulates the oil pressure supplied to the
VVT controller. Camshaft timing control is performed according to engine operating conditions such as the
intake air volume, throttle valve position and engine coolant temperature. The ECM controls the OCV,
based on the signals transmitted by several sensors. The VVT controller regulates the exhaust camshaft
angle using oil pressure through the OCV. As a result, the relative positions of the camshaft and
crankshaft are optimized, the engine torque and fuel economy improve, and the exhaust emissions
decrease under overall driving conditions. The ECM detects the actual exhaust valve timing using signals
from the camshaft and crankshaft position sensors, and performs feedback control. This is how the target
intake valve timing is verified by the ECM.
