5. PLASMACLUSTER ION GENERATOR CONTROL
(a) General:
(1) A Plasmacluster ion generator is provided inside
the air duct of the side register on the driver seat
side to improve the air quality and comfort in the
cabin.
(2) This generator is controlled by the A/C amplifier
and operates in conjunction with the blower
motor.
NOTICE:
• The Plasmacluster ion generator uses a
high voltage, which is hazardous.
Therefore, if the Plasmacluster ion
generator requires repairs, be sure to
have them done at a TOYOTA dealer.
