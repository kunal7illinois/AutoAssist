ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-97
4. Intake Air Chamber
(cid:1) The intake air chamber is made of plastic to realize lightweight.
(cid:1) The air intake chamber consists of upper and lower section and contains an intake air control valve. This
valve is activated by ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System) and is used to alter the intake pipe length
to improve the engine performance in all speed range. For details, see page EG-127.
(cid:1) The ACIS actuator has used an electric actuator and is laser-welded onto the intake air chamber. Many of
the components are made of plastic for weight reduction.

Laser-Welding:
In laser-welding, a laser-absorbing material (for the intake air chamber) is joined to a laser-transmitting
material (for the ACIS actuator). Laser beams are then irradiated from the laser-transmitting side. The
beams penetrate the laser-transmitting material to heat and melt the surface of the laser-absorbing material.
Then, the heat of the laser-absorbing material melts the laser-transmitting material and causes both
materials to become welded.
5. Intake Manifold
(cid:1) Light weight aluminum alloy is used for the intake manifold.
(cid:1) The intake manifold gaskets has rubber coating applied onto surface, and provide superior durability.
