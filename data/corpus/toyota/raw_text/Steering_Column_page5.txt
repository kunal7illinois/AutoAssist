(6) Measure the distance between the 2 lines on
the masking tape on the steering wheel.

(7) Convert the measured distance to steering
angle.
HINT:
Steering Wheel • Measured distance 1 mm (0.04 in.) =
Steering angle of approximately 1 degree.
• Make a note of the steering angle.

(b) Adjust steering angle.
(1) Draw a line on the RH and LH tie rod ends and
rack ends respectively where it can be easily
seen.
(2) Using a paper gauge, measure the distance
from the RH and LH tie rod ends to the rack
end screws.
Marked Line SR
HINT:
• Measure both the RH and LH sides.
• Make a note of the measured values.

(3) Remove the RH and LH boot clips from the
rack boots.
(4) Loosen the RH and LH lock nuts.
(5) Turn the RH and LH rack ends by the same
amount (but in different directions) according to
the steering angle.
HINT:
One 360 degree turn of the rack end (1.5 mm
(0.059 in.) horizontal movement) equals to 12
degrees of steering angle.

(6) Tighten the RH and LH lock nuts to the
specified torque.
Torque:74 N*m (755 kgf*cm, 55 ft.*lbf)
NOTICE:
Make sure that the difference in length
between the RH and LH tie rod ends and
rack end screws is within 1.5 mm (0.059 in.).
(7) Install the RH and LH boot clips.
