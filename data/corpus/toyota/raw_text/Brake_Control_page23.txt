BC–23
BRAKE CONTROL – ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
(a) Inspect the battery voltage.
Standard voltage:
11 to 14 V
If the voltage is below 11 V, recharge the battery
before proceeding.
(b) The vehicle's ECU uses the ISO 15765-4 for
communication protocol. The terminal arrangement
CG SG CANH of the DLC3 complies with SAE J1962 and matches
the ISO 15765-4 format.
HINT:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the
DLC3, turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to
910111213141516 use the intelligent tester. If the screen displays a
communication error message, a problem exists on
CANL BAT either the vehicle side or the tester side.

If the communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3 on
the original vehicle.
If the communication is still impossible when the
tester is connected to another vehicle, the problem
is probably in the tester itself. Consult the Service
Department listed in the tester's instruction manual.

NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
