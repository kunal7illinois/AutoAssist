2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Engine Coolant Temperature Circuit Range /
DTC P0116
Performance Problem
DESCRIPTION
A thermistor is built into the Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor, of which the resistance value
varies according to the ECT.
The structure of the sensor and its connection to the ECM are the same as those of the Intake Air
Temperature (IAT) sensor.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
ECTs as listed below are nearly same (2 trip detection
logic):
– ECT when engine is started at lower than 60°C
(140°F) of ECT
– ECT when engine is warmed up
• Thermostat ES
P0116 ECTs as listed below are nearly same when engine is • ECT sensor
started at higher than 60°C (140°F) of ECT (2 trip
detection logic)
– ECT when engine is stopped after driving
– ECT when engine is started at lower than 60°C
(140°F) of ECT
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECT sensor is used to monitor the ECT. The ECT sensor has a built-in thermistor with a resistance
that varies according to the temperature of the engine coolant. When the ECT drops, the resistance of the
thermistor increases. When the temperature rises, the resistance drops. These variations in the
resistance are reflected in the output voltage from the ECT sensor.
The ECM monitors the sensor voltage and uses this value to calculate the ECT. If the sensor output
voltage deviates from the normal operating range, the ECM interprets this deviation as a malfunction in
the ECT sensor and sets the DTC.
Examples:
(1)Upon starting the engine, the ECT is between 35°C and 60°C (95°F and 140°F). If, after driving for
250 seconds, the ECT remains within 3°C (5.4°F) of the starting temperature, the DTC is set (2 trip
detection logic).
(2)Upon starting the engine, the ECT is over 60°C (140°F). If, after driving for 250 seconds, the ECM
remains within 1°C (1.8°F) of the starting temperature, the DTC is set (6 trip detection logic).
