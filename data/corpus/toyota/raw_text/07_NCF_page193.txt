CHASSIS - U250E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE CH-29
6. Line Pressure Optimal Control
The line pressure is controlled by using solenoid valve SLT. Through the use of solenoid valve SLT, the line
pressure is optimally controlled in accordance with the engine torque information, as well as with the internal
operating conditions of the torque converter and the transaxle. Accordingly, the line pressure can be
accurately controlled in accordance with the engine output, traveling condition, and the ATF temperature,
thus realizing smooth shift characteristics and optimizing the workload of the oil pump.
