INSPECTION
1. INSPECT CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR
(a) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
between the terminals.
Resistance:
1,630 to 2,740 Ω at cold
2,065 to 3,225 Ω at hot
NOTICE:
The terms "cold" and "hot" refer to the
A094922
temperature of the coils. "Cold" means
approximately -10 to 50°C (14 to 122°F). "Hot"
means approximately 50 to 100°C (122 to 212°F).
If the resistance is not as specified, replace the
sensor.
