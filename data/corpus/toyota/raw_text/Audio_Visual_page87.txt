AUDIO / VISUAL – AUDIO AND VISUAL SYSTEM
Vehicle Speed Signal Circuit between Radio Receiver and Combination
Meter
DESCRIPTION
This circuit is necessary for the ASL (Auto Sound Leveliser) built into the radio receiver.
Speed signals are received from the combination meter and used for the ASL.
The ASL function automatically adjusts the sound data in order to enable hearing the clear audio sound
even when vehicle noise increases (as vehicle noise increases, the volume is turned up etc.).
HINT:
• A voltage of 12 V or 5 V is output from each ECU and then input to the combination meter. The signal
is changed to a pulse signal at the transistor in the combination meter. Each ECU controls the
respective system based on the pulse signal.
• If a short occurs in an ECU, all systems in the diagram below will not operate normally.
