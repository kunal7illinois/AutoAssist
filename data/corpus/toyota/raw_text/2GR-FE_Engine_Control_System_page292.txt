ES–292
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0504 Brake Switch "A" / "B" Correlation
DTC P0724 Brake Switch "B" Circuit High
DESCRIPTION
The stop light switch is a duplex system that transmits two signals: STP and ST1-. These two signals are
used by the ECM to monitor whether or not the brake system is working properly. If the signals, which
indicate the brake pedal is being depressed and released, are detected simultaneously, the ECM
interprets this as a malfunction in the stop light switch and sets the DTC.
HINT:
The normal conditions are as shown in the table below. The signals can be read using an intelligent tester.

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
This DTC indicates that the stop light switch remains on. When the stop light switch remains ON during
"stop and go" driving, the ECM interprets this as a fault in the stop light switch and the MIL comes on and
the ECM stores the DTC. The vehicle must stop (less than 2 mph (3 km/h)) and go (19 mph (30 km/h) or
more) 5 times in two driving cycles in order to detect a malfunction.
