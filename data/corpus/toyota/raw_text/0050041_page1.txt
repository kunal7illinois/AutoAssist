2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P050A Cold Start Idle Air Control System Performance
DTC P050B Cold Start Ignition Timing Performance
DESCRIPTION
The Electronic Throttle Control System (ETCS) controls the engine idling speed. The ETCS operates the
throttle actuator to open and close the throttle valve, and adjusts the intake air amount to achieve the
target idling speed.
In addition, the ECM retards the ignition timing and the ETCS increases the intake air amount to quickly
increase the catalyst temperature at cold start to reduce emissions.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
