ES–274
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
• The throttle actuator current (THROTTLE MOT) and the throttle actuator duty ratio (THROTL OPN
DUTY / THROTL CLS DUTY) can be read using the intelligent tester. However, the ECM shuts off the
throttle actuator current when the ETCS malfunctions.
1 INSPECT THROTTLE BODY (RESISTANCE OF THROTTLE ACTUATOR)
ES (a) Disconnect the B3 throttle body connector.
Component Side:
(b) Measure the resistance of the throttle actuator.
Throttle Body Standard resistance
Tester Connections Specified Conditions
0.3 to 100 Ω
2 (M+) - 1 (M-)
at 20°C (68°F)
(c) Reconnect the throttle body connector.

2 CHECK HARNESS AND CONNECTOR (THROTTLE ACTUATOR - ECM)
(a) Disconnect the B3 throttle body connector.
Wire Harness Side:
(b) Disconnect the B30 ECM connector.
(c) Measure the resistance.
Standard resistance (Check for open)
