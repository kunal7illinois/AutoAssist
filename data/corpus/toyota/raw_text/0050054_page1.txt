2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Throttle / Pedal Position Sensor / Switch "D"
DTC P2121
Circuit Range / Performance
DESCRIPTION
HINT:
Refer to DTC P2120 (see page ES-282).
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
Difference between VPA and VPA2 less than 0.4 V, or more • Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor
P2121
than 1.2 V for 0.5 seconds (1 trip detection logic) • ECM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
ES
When the difference between the output voltages of VPA and VPA2 deviates from the standard, the ECM
determines that the Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) sensor is malfunctioning. The ECM turns on the MIL
and the DTC is set.
MONITOR STRATEGY

Either of following conditions 1 or 2 met: -
1. Ignition switch ON
2. Throttle actuator power ON
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
Difference between VPA voltage (learned value) and VPA2 voltage
Less than 0.4 V, or more than 1.2 V
(learned value)
FAIL-SAFE
The APP sensor has two (main and sub) sensor circuits. If a malfunction occurs in either of the sensor
circuits, the ECM detects the abnormal signal voltage difference between the two sensor circuits and
switches to limp mode. In limp mode, the functioning circuit is used to calculate the accelerator pedal
opening angle to allow the vehicle to continue driving. If both circuits malfunction, the ECM regards the
opening angle of the accelerator pedal as being fully closed. In this case, the throttle valve remains closed
as if the engine is idling.
If a pass condition is detected and then the ignition switch is turned OFF, the fail-safe operation stops and
the system returns to a normal condition.
