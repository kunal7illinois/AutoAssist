2GR-FE STARTING – SMART KEY SYSTEM
Engine does not Start
DESCRIPTION
1. ENGINE START SYSTEM FUNCTION
(a) If the engine switch is pressed with the shift lever in the P or N position and the brake pedal
depressed, the main body ECU determines that it is an engine start request.
(b) The certification ECU and other ECUs perform key verification via the LIN communication line.
(c) The main body ECU activates the ACC relay.
(d) The main body ECU activates the IG1 and IG2 relays.
(e) The certification ECU outputs a steering UNLOCK signal. The signal is sent to the main body
ECU via the steering lock ECU.
(f) The main body ECU sends an engine start request signal to the ECM.
(g) The ECM sends an ACC cut request signal to the main body ECU.
(h) The ECM and main body ECU activate the ST relay.
(i) The main body ECU deactivates the ACC relay until the ECU detects an engine start.
(j) When engine revolution speed reaches 200 rpm, the main body ECU determines that the engine
has been started.
The ECU reactivates the ACC relay and turns off the engine switch indicator light.
