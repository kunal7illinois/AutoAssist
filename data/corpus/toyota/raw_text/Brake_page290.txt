BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
1. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
HINT:
• The skid control ECU is located within the brake
actuator assembly.
• The yaw rate sensor and acceleration sensor are
combined in a single unit. This unit communicates
with the skid control ECU through the CAN
communication system.
(a) ABS operation
(1) Based on the signals received from the 4 wheel
speed sensors, the skid control ECU calculates
the deceleration and speed of each wheel, while
monitoring for wheel lock. If wheel lock is
occurring, the ECU controls the solenoid valves
in the brake actuator in order to adjust the
hydraulic pressure applied to the brakes at each
wheel. BC
