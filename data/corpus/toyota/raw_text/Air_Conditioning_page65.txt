DTC B1422/22 Compressor Lock Sensor Circuit
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The ECM sends a signal to the A/C amplifier via CAN communication.
The A/C amplifier reads the difference between compressor speed and engine speed. When the
difference becomes too large, the A/C amplifier determines that the compressor locks, and turns the
magnetic clutch off.
