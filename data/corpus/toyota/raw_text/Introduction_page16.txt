INTRODUCTION – REPAIR INSTRUCTION
(2) Never measure the resistance of the airbag
squib. This may cause the airbag to inflate,
which could cause serious injury.

(3) Grease or detergents of any kind should not be
applied to the front passenger airbag assembly.
(4) Store the airbag assembly in an area where the
ambient temperature is below 93°C (200°F), the
humidity is not high and there is no electrical
noise.
(5) When using electric welding anywhere on the
vehicle, disconnect the airbag ECU connectors
(4 pins). These connectors contain shorting
springs. This feature reduces the possibility of
the airbag deploying due to current entering the
squib wiring.
(6) When disposing of the vehicle or the airbag
assembly unit by itself, the airbag should be
deployed using SST before disposal (See page
RS-399). Activate the airbag in a safe place
away from electrical noise.
(e) DRIVER SIDE KNEE AIRBAG ASSEMBLY
(1) Always place a removed or new knee airbag
assembly with the airbag inflation direction
facing upward. Placing the airbag assembly with
the airbag inflation direction facing downward
could cause a serious accident if the airbag
inflates.
