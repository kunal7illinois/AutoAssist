2 PERFORM ACTIVE TEST USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (A/F CONTROL)
ES
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine and turn the tester ON.
(c) Warm up the engine at an engine speed of 2,500 rpm for
approximately 90 seconds.
(d) On the tester, select the following menu items:
DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST / A/F
CONTROL.
(e) Perform the A/F CONTROL operation with the engine in
an idling condition (press the RIGHT or LEFT button to
change the fuel injection volume).
(f) Monitor the voltage outputs of the A/F and HO2 sensors
(AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2) displayed on the tester.
Result:
A/F sensor reacts in accordance with increases
and decreases in fuel injection volume:
+25 % = Rich output:
Less than 3.0 V
-12.5 % = Lean output:
More than 3.35 V
NOTICE:
The A/F sensor has an output delay of a few seconds and
the HO2 sensor has a maximum output delay of
approximately 20 seconds.
