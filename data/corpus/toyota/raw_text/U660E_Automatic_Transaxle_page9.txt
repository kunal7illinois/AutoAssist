U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
1. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
(a) The ECT (Electronic controlled automatic transaxle)
is an automatic transaxle that has its shift timing
electronically controlled by the Transmission Control
Module (TCM). The TCM detects electrical signals AX
that indicate engine and driving conditions, and
controls the shift point, based on driver's habits and
road conditions. As a result, fuel efficiency and
transaxle performance are improved.
Shift shock has been reduced by controlling the
engine and transaxle simultaneously.
In addition, the ECT has features such as:
• Diagnostic function.
• Fail-safe function for use when a malfunction
occurs.
