AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
• Do not apply any type of spray (such as a
cleaning solvent or hair spray) or stick
any foreign matter into the Plasmacluster
ion outlet, as this could cause improper
operation or a malfunction.
• After use, dust may accumulate around
the side register on the driver seat side. If
this occurs, press the OFF switch on the
heater control panel to stop the blower
motor before cleaning the area.
• It is normal for the Plasmacluster ion
generator to emit a slight sound during
operation. This sound is created when
electrons collide with the electrode while
Plasmacluster ions are being generated.
HINT:
PlasmaclusterTM, plasmacluster, and
plasmacluster ions are a trademark of the
SHARP Corporation.
(b) Operation:
(1) The Plasmacluster ion generator produces
positive and negative ions from the water
molecules (H2O) and oxygen molecules (O2) in
the air, and emits them into the air. These ions
reduce airborne germs.
6. BLOWER MOTOR
The blower motor has a built-in blower controller, and is AC
controlled with duty control from the A/C amplifier.
