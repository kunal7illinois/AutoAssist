2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0505 Idle Control System Malfunction
DESCRIPTION
The idling speed is controlled by the ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System). The ETCS is comprised
of: 1) the one valve type throttle body; 2) the throttle actuator, which operates the throttle valve; 3) the
Throttle Position (TP) sensor, which detects the opening angle of the throttle valve; 4) the Accelerator
Pedal Position (APP) sensor, which detects the accelerator pedal position; and 5) the ECM, which
controls the ETCS. Based on the target idling speed, the ECM controls the throttle actuator to provide the
proper throttle valve opening angle.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
• ETCS
Idling speed continues to vary greatly from target idling speed • Air induction system
ES P0505
(2 trip detection logic) • PCV hose connections
• ECM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM monitors the idling speed and idling air flow volume to conduct Idle Speed Control (ISC). The
ECM determines that the ISC system is malfunctioning if the following conditions apply:
• The learned idling air flow volume remains at the maximum or minimum volume 5 times or more during
a drive cycle.
• After driving at 10 km/h (6.25 mph) or more, the actual engine idling speed varies from the target idling
speed by between 100 rpm and 200 rpm, 5 times or more during a drive cycle.
Example:
If the actual idling speed varies from the target idling speed by more than 200 rpm* 5 times during a drive
cycle, the ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
HINT:
*: Threshold idling speed varies with engine load.
