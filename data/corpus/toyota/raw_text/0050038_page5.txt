2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0500 Vehicle Speed Sensor "A"
DESCRIPTION
The speed sensor detects the wheel speed and sends the appropriate signals to the skid control ECU.
The skid control ECU converts these wheel speed signals into a 4-pulse signal and outputs it to the ECM
via the combination meter. The ECM determines the vehicle speed based on the frequency of these pulse
signals.

DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
• Open or short in speed signal circuit
While vehicle being driven, no vehicle speed sensor signal • Vehicle speed sensor
P0500 transmitted to ECM • Combination meter
(1 trip detection logic) • ECM
• Skid control ECU
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM assumes that the vehicle is being driven, when the indicated engine speed is more than 2,300
rpm and 30 seconds have elapsed since the Park/Neutral Position (PNP) switch was turned OFF. If there
is no speed signal from the combination meter, despite these conditions being met, the ECM interprets
this as a malfunction in the speed signal circuit. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
