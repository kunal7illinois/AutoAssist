DOOR LOCK – POWER DOOR LOCK CONTROL SYSTEM
Driver Side Door Key Lock and Unlock Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The driver's door key lock and unlock switch is built into the driver's door lock assembly.
When the driver's door key cylinder is turned to lock all the doors by key, there is continuity between
terminals L and E of the key lock and unlock switch. When the cylinder is turned to unlock the door(s),
there is continuity between terminals UL and E.
Terminals L2 and UL3 of the main body ECU are connected to the door lock assembly, and door lock/
unlock request signals (by key) are input to the main body ECU.
The main body ECU constantly applies voltage to terminal L of the driver's door lock assembly via
terminal L2. When the driver's door key cylinder is turned to lock all the doors by key, current flows from
terminal L2 to terminal L.
The main body ECU also applies constant voltage to terminal UL of the door lock assembly via terminal
UL3. When the door key cylinder is turned in the direction to unlock the door(s) by key, current flows from
terminal UL3 to terminal UL.
