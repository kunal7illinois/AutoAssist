(a) GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
(1) In the occupant classification system, the
occupant classification ECU calculates the
weight of the occupant based on a signal from
the occupant classification sensors. This system
recognizes the occupant as a child if it detects a
weight of less than 36 kg (79.37 lb), and
disables the front passenger airbag and front
passenger side-side airbag.
(2) This system is mainly comprised of 4 occupant
classification sensors that detect the load on the
front passenger seat. The occupant
classification ECU controls the system, and the
passenger airbag ON/OFF indicator indicates
the ON/OFF condition of the front passenger
airbag and front passenger side-side airbag.
