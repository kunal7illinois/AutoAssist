ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-27
(cid:3)IGNITION SYSTEM
1. General
A DIS (Direct Ignition System) is used. The DIS improves the ignition timing accuracy, reduces high-voltage
loss, and enhances the overall reliability of the ignition system by eliminating the distributor. The DIS in this
engine is an independent ignition system, which has one ignition coil (with igniter) for each cylinder.

2. Ignition Coil
The DIS provides 4 ignition coils, one for each cylinder. The spark plug caps, which provide contact to the
spark plugs, are integrated with an ignition coil. Also, an igniter is enclosed to simplify the system.
3. Spark Plug
Iridium-tipped spark plugs are used to realize a 120,000 mile (192,000 km) maintenance-free operation. By
making the center electrode of iridium, the same ignition performance as the platinum-tipped spark plug have
been achieved and further improvement of durability has been realized.
