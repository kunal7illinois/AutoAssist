DESCRIPTION
BC
The skid control ECU receives the signals from the ECM, steering angle sensor, and yaw rate and
acceleration sensor via the CAN communication system.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When any of the following is detected:
1. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, after the
output of data from the skid control ECU is completed,
the sending continues for 5 seconds or more.
2. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, the condition
that bus OFF state occurs once or more within 100 ms
occurs 10 times in succession. (Sent signals cannot be
received.)
U0073/94 3. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, a delay in CAN communication system
receiving data from the yaw rate and acceleration sensor
and steering angle sensor continues for 1 second or
more.
4. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, the condition
that a delay in receiving data from the yaw rate and
acceleration sensor and steering angle sensor occurs
more than once within 5 seconds occurs 10 times in
succession within 60 seconds.
When either of the following is detected:
1. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more and the
vehicle speed 9 mph (15 km/h) or more, data cannot be CAN communication system
U0100/65
sent to the ECM for 2 seconds or more. (Skid control ECU to ECM)
2. The IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more and the vehicle
speed 9 mph (15 km/h) or more for 2 seconds or more.
When either of the following is detected:
1. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, data from the
yaw rate sensor cannot be received for 1 second or more.
CAN communication system
U0123/62 2. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, the following
(Skid control ECU to yaw rate and acceleration sensor)
occurs 10 times in succession within 60 seconds.
• The condition that data from the yaw rate sensor cannot
be received occurs once or more within 5 seconds.
When either of the following is detected:
1. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, data from the
acceleration sensor cannot be received for 1 second or
more.
CAN communication system
U0124/95 2. With the IG1 terminal voltage 10 V or more, the following
(Skid control ECU to yaw rate and acceleration sensor)
occurs 10 times in succession within 60 seconds.
• The condition that data from the acceleration sensor
cannot be received occurs once or more within 5
seconds.
