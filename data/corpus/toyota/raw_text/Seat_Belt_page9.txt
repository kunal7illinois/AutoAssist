SEAT BELT – SEAT BELT WARNING SYSTEM
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the
DLC3, turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to
use the tester. If the display indicates that a
communication error has occurred, there is a
problem either with the vehicle or with the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
of the original vehicle.
• If communication is still not possible when the
tester is connected to another vehicle, the
problem may be in the tester itself. Consult the
Service Department listed in the tester's
instruction manual.
