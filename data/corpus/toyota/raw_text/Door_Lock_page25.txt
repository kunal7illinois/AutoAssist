DOOR LOCK – POWER DOOR LOCK CONTROL SYSTEM
Front Passenger Side Door UNLOCK Detection Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The front passenger door unlock detection switch is built into the front passenger door lock assembly. The
switch turns on when the front passenger door is locked and turns off when the door is unlocked.
The main body ECU is connected to the front passenger door lock assembly via terminal LSWP and front
passenger door lock/unlock state signals are input to the ECU.
The main body ECU applies voltage to the door unlock detection switch via terminal LSWP. When the
door unlock detection switch is on (there is continuity between the switch terminals), a lock state signal is
input to the ECU. When the switch is off (there is no continuity between the switch terminals), an unlock
state signal is input.
