BC–212
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
DTC C1241/41 Low Battery Positive Voltage
DESCRIPTION
If a malfunction is detected in the power supply circuit, the skid control ECU (housed in the actuator
assembly) stores this DTC and the fail safe function prohibits ABS operation.
This DTC is stored when the IG1 terminal voltage deviates from the DTC detection condition due to a
malfunction in the power supply or charging circuit such as the battery or alternator circuit, etc.
The DTC is cancelled when the IG1 terminal voltage returns to normal.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When any of the following is detected:
1. At a vehicle speed of 2 mph (3 km/h) or more, the IG1
terminal voltage is 9.5 V or less for 10 seconds or more.
• ECU-IG NO. 2 fuse
2. When the solenoid relay remains ON and the IG1
• Battery
terminal voltage is 9.5 V or less, the relay contact is open
C1241/41 • Charging system
for 0.2 seconds or more.
• Power source circuit
3. While the VSC NO. 1 (fail safe) relay is ON after VSC
• Internal power supply circuit of the skid control ECU
NO. 2 relay ON, the IG1 terminal voltage is 9.5 V or less
and the actuator pump drive motor is OFF for 0.1 second
or more.
