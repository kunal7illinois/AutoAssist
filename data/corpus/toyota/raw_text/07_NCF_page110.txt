ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-83
(cid:1) A compact block has been achieved by producing the thin cast-iron liners and cylinder block as a unit. It
is not possible to bore the block with this liner.
(cid:1) The liners are the spiny-type, which have been manufactured so that their casting exterior forms a large
irregular surface in order to enhance the adhesion between the liners and the aluminum cylinder block.
The enhanced adhesion helps improve heat dissipation, resulting in a lower overall temperature and heat
deformation of the cylinder bores.

5. Piston
(cid:1) The piston is made of aluminum alloy.
(cid:1) The piston head portion uses a taper squish shape to accomplish fuel combustion efficiency.
(cid:1) The piston skirt is coated with resin to reduce the friction loss.
(cid:1) The groove of the top ring is coated with alumite to ensure abrasion resistance.
(cid:1) By increasing the machining precision of the cylinder bore diameter, the outer diameter of the piston is
made into one size.
