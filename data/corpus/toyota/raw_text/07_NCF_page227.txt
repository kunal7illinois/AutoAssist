CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE CH-63
Speed Sensors
(cid:3) The U660E automatic transaxle uses an input turbine speed sensor (for the NT signal) and a counter gear
speed sensor (for the NC signal). Thus, the ECT ECU can detect the timing of the shifting of the gears
and appropriately control the engine torque and hydraulic pressure in response to the various conditions.
These speed sensors are the Hall type.
(cid:3) The input turbine speed sensor detects the input speed of the transaxle. The No.2 clutch piston is used
as the timing rotor for this sensor.
(cid:3) The counter gear speed sensor detects the speed of the counter gear. The counter drive gear is used as
the timing rotor for this sensor.
(cid:3) The Hall type speed sensor consists of a magnet and Hall IC. The Hall IC converts the changes in the
magnetic flux density that occur through the rotation of the timing rotor into electric signal, and outputs
the signal to the ECT ECU.
