INSTALLATION
RH: LH: BC
1. INSTALL SKID CONTROL SENSOR
(a) Clean the contact surface between the axle hub and
a new skid control sensor.
NOTICE:
Prevent foreign matter from attaching to the
sensor rotor.
(b) Place the skid control sensor on the axle hub so that
CONNECTOR the connector is positioned as shown in the
C132785E01
illustration.
(c) Using SST, a press, 2 V-blocks, and 2 steel plates,
SST
install the skid control sensor to the axle hub.
SST 09309-36010, 09213-58013
SST NOTICE:
• Keep the sensor away from magnets.
• Do not use a hammer on the skid control
sensor.
• Check that there is no foreign matter such as
iron chips on the detecting portion of the skid
control sensor.
