(c) Using a vernier caliper, measure the valve overall
length.
Standard overall length:
101.15 mm (3.9823 in.)
Minimum overall length:
Overall Length
100.70 mm (3.9646 in.)
If the overall length is less than the minimum,
replace the exhaust valve.

(d) Using a micrometer, measure the diameter of the
valve stem.
Standard valve stem diameter:
5.465 to 5.480 mm (0.2152 to 0.2158 in.)
If the overall length is less than the minimum,
replace the exhaust valve. EM

(e) Using a vernier caliper, measure the valve head
margin thickness.
Standard margin thickness:
1.40 mm (0.0551 in.)
Minimum margin thickness:
1.20 mm (0.0472 in.)
If the overall length is less than the minimum,
Margin Thickness
replace the exhaust valve.

14. INSPECT INTAKE VALVE GUIDE BUSH
(a) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inside diameter
of the guide bush.
Standard bush inside diameter:
5.510 to 5.530 mm (0.2169 to 0.2177 in.)
If the inside diameter is not as specified, replace the
intake valve guide bush.
(b) Subtract the valve stem diameter measurement
from the guide bush inside diameter measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
A013367E01
0.025 to 0.060 mm (0.0010 to 0.0024 in.)
Maximum oil clearance:
0.08 mm (0.0032 in.)
If the clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the valve and intake guide bush.
