Intelligent Tester
1. CHECK DTC
(a) DTCs which are stored in the TCM can be displayed
with the intelligent tester.
These scan tools can display pending DTCs and
current DTCs. Some DTCs are not stored if the AX
TCM doesn't detect a malfunction during
consecutive driving. However, the malfunction
detected while a driving is stored as a pending DTC.
(1) Connect the intelligent tester to the Controller
Area Network Vehicle Interface Module (CAN
VIM). Then connect the CAN VIM to the Data
DLC3 Link Connector 3 (DLC3).

NOTICE:
When a symptom has been duplicated using
normal mode, use the intelligent tester to
check for DTCs. For DTCs that are subject to
"2-trip detection logic", perform the
following steps:
Turn the ignition switch OFF after the symptom
has occurred once. Repeat the process of
attempting to duplicate the symptom. When the
problem or symptom happens for the second
time and a DTC has been recorded, the MIL will
illuminate, and the code will be stored.
