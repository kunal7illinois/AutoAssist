Following the A/F CONTROL procedure enables technicians
ES
to check and graph the voltage outputs of both the A/F and
HO2 sensors.
To display the graph, select the following menu items on the
tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST /
A/F CONTROL / USER DATA / AFS B1S1 and O2S B1S2;
then press the YES button and then the ENTER button
followed by the F4 button.

3 READ VALUE USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (MAF)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the tester ON.
(c) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / MAF and
COOLANT TEMP.
(d) Allow the engine to idle until the COOLANT TEMP
reaches 75°C (167°F) or more.
(e) Read the MAF with the engine in an idling condition and
at an engine speed of 2,500 rpm.
Standard:
MAF while engine idling: Between 1 g/sec. and 3 g/
sec. (shift position: N, A/C: OFF).
MAF at engine speed of 2,500 rpm: Between 2 g/
sec. and 6 g/sec. (shift position: N, A/C: OFF).
