PRECAUTION
1. HANDLING PRECAUTIONS FOR SRS AIRBAG
SYSTEM
(a) The vehicle is equipped with an SRS (Supplemental
Restraint System) such as airbags. Failure to carry
out service operations in the correct sequence could
cause the SRS to unexpectedly deploy during
servicing. This may cause a serious accident.
Before servicing (including inspection, replacement,
removal and installation of parts), be sure to read
the precautionary notices for the Supplemental
Restraint System (See page RS-1).
2. PRECAUTIONS FOR REMOVAL, INSTALLATION AND
REPLACEMENT OF POWER STEERING

(a) Be sure to turn the front wheels straight ahead when
removing and installing the power steering link
assembly.
(b) If disconnecting the steering sliding yoke and the
pinion shaft of the power steering link assembly, be
sure to put matchmarks before starting the
operation.
