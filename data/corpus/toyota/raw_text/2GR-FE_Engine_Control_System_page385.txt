DTC No. Monitoring Item DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area Detection Timing
Logic
Soak timer (built
P2610 ECM internal malfunction ECM Engine running 2 trip
into ECM)
DESCRIPTION
To ensure the accuracy of the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) monitor values, the soak timer, which is built
into the ECM, measures 5 hours (+/- 15 minutes) from when the ignition switch is turned off, before the
monitor is run. This allows the fuel to cool down, which stabilizes the Fuel Tank Pressure (FTP). When 5 ES
hours have elapsed, the ECM turns on.

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
5 hours after the ignition switch is turned off, the soak timer activates the ECM to begin the EVAP system
monitor. While the engine is running, the ECM monitors the synchronization of the soak timer and the
CPU clock. If these two are not synchronized, the ECM interprets this as a malfunction, illuminates the
MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
