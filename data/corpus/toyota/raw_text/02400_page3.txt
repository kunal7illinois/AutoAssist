3. INSPECT V-RIBBED BELT
(a) Visually check the belt for excessive wear, frayed
cords, etc.
If any defects are found, replace the V-ribbed belt.
HINT:
Cracks on the rib side of the belt are considered
acceptable. If the belt has chunks missing from the
ribs, it should be replaced.
A095340E01
(b) Check that the belt fits properly in the ribbed
grooves.
HINT:
Confirm by hand that the belt has not slipped out of
the grooves on the bottom of the pulley.
4. INSPECT GENERATOR WIRING
(a) Visually check the generator wiring.
CORRECT INCORRECT
(1) Check that the wiring is in good condition.
5. CHECK FOR ABNORMAL NOISES
A111819E01
(a) Listen for abnormal noises from the generator.
(1) Check that no abnormal noises are heard from
the generator while the engine is running.
6. INSPECT CHARGE WARNING LIGHT CIRCUIT
(a) Turn the ignition switch ON. Check that the charge
warning light comes on.
(b) Start the engine and check that the light goes off.
If the light does not operate as specified,
troubleshoot the charge warning light circuit.
7. INSPECT CHARGING CIRCUIT WITHOUT LOAD
Disconnect Wire
(a) Connect a voltmeter and ammeter to the charging
from Terminal B
circuit as follows.
(1) Disconnect the wire from terminal B of the
generator, then connect it to the negative (-)
lead of an ammeter.
(2) Connect the positive (+) lead of the ammeter to
terminal B of the generator.
(3) Connect the positive (+) lead of a voltmeter to
terminal B of the generator.
A088419E04
(4) Ground the negative (-) lead of the voltmeter.
(b) Check the charging circuit.
(1) Keep the engine speed at 2,000 rpm and check
the reading on the ammeter and voltmeter.
Standard amperage:
10 A or less CH
Standard voltage:
12.1 to 15.4 V
If the result is not as specified, replace the
generator.
HINT:
If the battery is not fully charged, the ammeter
reading will sometimes be more than the
standard amperage.
