2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM optimizes the valve timing using the VVT system to control the exhaust camshaft. The VVT
system includes the ECM, the OCV and the VVT controller. The ECM sends a target duty-cycle control
signal to the OCV. This control signal regulates the oil pressure supplied to the VVT controller. The VVT
controller can advance or retard the exhaust camshaft.
After the ECM sends the target duty-cycle signal to the OCV, the ECM monitors the OCV current to
establish an actual duty-cycle. The ECM determines the existence of a malfunction and sets the DTC
when the actual duty-cycle ratio varies from the target duty-cycle ratio.
