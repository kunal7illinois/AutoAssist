BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
1 CHECK SPEED SENSOR AND SPEED SENSOR ROTOR SERRATIONS
(a) Disconnect the skid control ECU connector.
Skid Control ECU Harness Side (b) Connect the oscilloscope to each speed sensor terminal
Connector Front View: of the skid control ECU.
(c) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated (by the sensor circuit).
FR+ FL- RR+ OK:
RL-
A26 The same waveform is output from all the 4 wheels and
there is no noise or interference in the waveform.
(d) Check that the waveform does not change while jiggling
a connector or a wire harness.
OK:
RL+ The waveform does not change.
FR- FL+ RR-
HINT:
• As the vehicle speed (wheel revolution speed)
Normal Signal Waveform:
increases, a cycle of the waveform narrows and the
BC
output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated due to
speed sensor rotor's scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to it.

2 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Reconnect the skid control ECU connector.
(b) Clear the DTC (See page BC-141).
(c) Start the engine.
(d) Drive the vehicle at the speed of 12 mph (20 km/h) or
more for at least 60 seconds.
(e) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-141).
