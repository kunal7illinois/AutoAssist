*1:Fail-safe control is not actuated when the ON malfunction occurs.
*2:If malfunctions already exist in any of the P, R or N range positions and a malfunction is detected when
the gear is shifted to the 1st gear, the gear position is fixed in the 5th gear. After that, if any of the P, R
or N range positions is selected, the gear is fixed in the 3rd gear position.
*3:The gear is fixed in the neutral position until the vehicle speed reaches a certain speed that enables the
transaxle to be shifted.
*4:Shifting to the 5th and 6th gears is prohibited.
