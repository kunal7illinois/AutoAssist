ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-135
12. Diagnosis
(cid:1) When the ECM detects a malfunction, the ECM makes a diagnosis and memorizes the failed section.
Furthermore, the MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) in the combination meter illuminates or blinks to
inform the driver.
(cid:1) The ECM will also store the DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) of the malfunctions. The DTC can be
accessed by using the hand-held tester.
(cid:1) For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
Service Tip
(cid:1) The ECM of the ’07 Camry uses the CAN protocol for diagnostic communication. Therefore, a
hand-held tester and a dedicated adapter [CAN VIM (Vehicle Interface Module)] are required for
accessing diagnostic data. For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
(cid:1) To clear the DTC that is stored in the ECM, use a hand-held tester, disconnect the battery terminal
or remove the EFI No.1 fuse and ETCS fuse for 1 minute or longer.
