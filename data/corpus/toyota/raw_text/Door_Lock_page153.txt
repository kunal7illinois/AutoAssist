DOOR LOCK – SMART KEY SYSTEM
14. BATTERY SAVING
(a) Vehicle Battery Saving Function
In the smart key system, signals are emitted outside
of the vehicle at a prescribed interval (0.25 seconds)
when the doors are locked. Therefore, the vehicle
battery could be drained if the vehicle remains
parked for a long time. For this reason, the controls
listed below are carried out:
Condition Control
Both conditions below are met for 5 days:
• Electrical key is not in detection area Signal transmission interval is extended from 0.25 to 0.75 seconds
• Touch sensor or lock switch operation is not performed
Both conditions below are met for 14 days:
• Electrical key is not in detection area Automatically deactivates the smart key system
• Touch sensor or lock switch operation is not performed
Reinstatement Conditions
• A wireless door lock control signal (lock, unlock)
is input and the ID code matches.
• A user carries the electrical key and pushes a
lock switch on an outside door handle.
• A door is locked or unlocked by the mechanical
key.
(b) Electrical Key Battery and Vehicle Battery Saving
Function
In the smart key system, if the electrical key is
constantly located within the vehicle exterior
detection area of the doors, the system maintains
periodic communication with the electrical key.
Therefore, if the vehicle remains parked in that state
for a long time, the electrical key battery and the
vehicle battery could be drained. For this reason, if
this state continues longer than 10 minutes, the
smart key system automatically becomes
deactivated.
Reinstatement Conditions
• A wireless door lock control signal (lock, unlock)
is input and the ID code matches.
• A user carries the electrical key and pushes a
lock switch on an outside door handle.
• A door is locked or unlocked by the mechanical
key.
