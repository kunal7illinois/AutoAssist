Item Specified Condition
Standard valve 93.3 to 122.7 kPa (0.95 to 1.25 kgf/
A104601E03
(for brand-new cap) cm2, 13.5 to 17.8 psi)
Minimum standard valve
78.5 kPa (0.8 kgf/cm2, 11.4 psi)

If the maximum pressure is less than the
specified pressure for the minimum standard
valve, replace the radiator cap sub-assembly.
ON-VEHICLE CLEANING
1. INSPECT FINS BLOCKAGE
(a) If the fins are clogged, wash them with water or a
steam cleaner. Dry with compressed air.
NOTICE:
• If the distance between the steam cleaner and
the core is too close, the fins may become
damaged. Keep the following injection
distance.

Injection Distance Injection Pressure
2,942 to 4,903 kPa
300 mm (11.81 in.)
(30 to 50 kg/cm2, 427 to 711 psi)
4,903 to 7,845 kPa
500 mm (19.69 in.)
(50 to 80 kg/cm2, 711 to 1,138 psi)
• If the fins are bent, straighten them with a
screwdriver or pliers.
• Never apply water directly onto the electronic
