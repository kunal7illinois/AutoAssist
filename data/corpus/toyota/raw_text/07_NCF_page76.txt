6. ETCS-i (Electronic Throttle Control System-intelligent)
General
In the conventional throttle body, the throttle valve angle is determined invariably by the amount of the
accelerator pedal effort. In contrast, ETCS-i uses the ECM to calculate the optimal throttle valve angle that
is appropriate for the respective driving condition and uses a throttle control motor to control the angle.
