INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• DTCs P0327 and P0328 are for the bank 1 knock sensor circuit.
• DTCs P0332 and P0333 are for the bank 2 knock sensor circuit.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
