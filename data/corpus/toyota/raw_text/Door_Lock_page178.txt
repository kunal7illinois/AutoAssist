(3) Inspect the electrical key lock-in prevention's
detection area and the entry door control
receiver for wave leaks. Hold the electrical key
at the same height as the lower edge of the
luggage compartment door and align the key
with the center of the rear of the vehicle. Pay
attention to the direction and position of the
electrical key shown in the illustration. When
the electrical key is over 0.1 m (0.3 ft) from the
vehicle's rear bumper, check that the electrical
key's wireless buzzer does not sound.

control receiver may have a wave leak.

key system cancel function) is ON, check that
all functions in the smart key system cannot be
operated.
