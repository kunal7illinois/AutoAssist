DESCRIPTION
The circuit description can be found in the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) System (See page ES-400).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
Refer to the EVAP System (See page ES-400).
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The two monitors, Key-off and Purge Flow, are used to detect malfunctions relating to DTC P0441. The
key-off monitor is initiated by the ECM internal timer, known as the soak timer, 5 hours* after the engine
switch is turned off. The purge flow monitor runs while the engine is running.
