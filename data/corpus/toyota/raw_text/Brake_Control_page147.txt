BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
(c) After performing the check, disconnect the SST
from terminals TS and CG, and TC and CG of the
DLC3 and turn the ignition switch off.
(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
HINT:
• If the ignition switch is not turned on (IG) after the
SST is removed from the DLC3, the previous
Test Mode will continue.
• If the ignition switch is turned on (IG) with
terminals TS and CG shorted, the previous Test
Mode will continue.
