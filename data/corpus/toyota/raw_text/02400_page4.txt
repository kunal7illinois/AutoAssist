8. INSPECT CHARGING CIRCUIT WITH LOAD
(a) With the engine running at 2,000 rpm, turn the high
beam headlights ON and turn the heater blower
switch to the "HI" position.
(b) Check the reading on the ammeter.
Standard amperage:
30 A or more
If the ammeter reading is less than the standard
amperage, repair the generator.
HINT:
If the battery is fully charged, the indication will
sometimes be less than the standard amperage. If
this is the case, add more electrical load (operate
the wipers, rear window defogger, etc.) and check
the reading on the ammeter again.
