HINT:
*1: Voltage is output only when the engine is
cranking.
*2: Voltage is output for 0.3 seconds when the
engine is cranking to start. Disconnect the C55
connector from the ECM before measuring the
voltage.
If the result is not as specified, the ECU may have a
malfunction.
(e) Using an oscilloscope, check the signal waveform of
the ECU.
