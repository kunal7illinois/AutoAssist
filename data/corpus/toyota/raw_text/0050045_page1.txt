ES–258
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0617 Starter Relay Circuit High
DESCRIPTION
While the engine is being cranked, the positive battery voltage is applied to terminal STA of the ECM. If
the ECM detects the Starter Control (STA) signal while the vehicle is being driven, it determines that there
is a malfunction in the STA circuit. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
This monitor runs when the vehicle is driven at 20 km/h (12.4 mph) for over 20 seconds.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
When conditions (a), (b) and (c) met, positive (+B) battery
voltage 10.5 V or more applied to ECM for 20 seconds (1 trip • Park/Neutral Position (PNP) switch
detection logic) • Starter relay circuit
P0617
(a) Vehicle speed 20 km/h (12.4 mph) or more • Ignition switch
ES (b) Engine speed 1,000 rpm or more • ECM
(c) STA signal ON
