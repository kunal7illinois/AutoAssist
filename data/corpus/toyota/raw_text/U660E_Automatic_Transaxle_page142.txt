Torque Converter Clutch Pressure Control
DTC P2759 Solenoid Control Circuit Electrical (Shift Sole-
noid Valve SLU)
AX DESCRIPTION
The amount of current flow to the solenoid is controlled by the (*) duty ratio of the TCM output signal. The
higher the duty ratio becomes, the higher the lock-up hydraulic pressure becomes during the lock-up
operation.

(*) Duty Ratio
The duty ratio is the ratio of the period of continuity in one cycle. For example, if A is the period of
continuity in one cycle, and B is the period of non-continuity, then Duty Ratio = A/(A+B) x 100 (%).
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
Open or short is detected in shift solenoid valve SLU • Open or short in shift solenoid valve SLU circuit
P2759 circuit for 1 second or more while driving (1-trip • Shift solenoid valve SLU
detection logic). • TCM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
When an open or short in a shift solenoid valve (SLU) circuit is detected, the TCM determines there is a
malfunction. The TCM will turn on the MIL and store this DTC.
