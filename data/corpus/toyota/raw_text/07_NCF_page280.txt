CH-116 CHASSIS - BRAKE
ABS with EBD Operation
Based on the signals received from the 4 wheel speed sensors and yaw rate & deceleration sensor, the skid
control ECU calculates each wheel speed and deceleration, and checks wheel slipping condition. According
to the slipping condition, the ECU controls the pressure holding solenoid valve and pressure reduction
solenoid valve in order to adjust the fluid pressure of each wheel cylinder in the following three modes:
pressure reduction, pressure holding, and pressure increase modes.
