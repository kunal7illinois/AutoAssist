SEAT BELT – SEAT BELT WARNING SYSTEM
Driver Side Seat Belt Warning Light does not Operate
DESCRIPTION
When the ignition switch is on (IG), the center airbag sensor assembly transmits front seat inner belt state
signals to the combination meter assembly through CAN. If the driver seat belt is not fastened, the
combination meter assembly blinks the driver seat belt warning light. If the seat belt is fastened, the
warning light goes off.
NOTICE:
The seat belt warning system uses CAN. Before troubleshooting the seat belt warning system,
perform "COMMUNICATION FUNCTION CHECK" by following "HOW TO PROCEED WITH
TROUBLESHOOTING" to confirm that the communication systems are normal.
