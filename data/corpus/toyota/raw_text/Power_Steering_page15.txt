1. INSPECT VANE PUMP SHAFT AND BUSHING IN
VANE PUMP FRONT HOUSING
(a) Using a micrometer, measure the outer diameter [a]
of the vane pump shaft with pulley.
[a]
(b) Using a vernier caliper, measure the inner diameter
[b] of the vane pump front housing bushing.
(c) Calculate the oil clearance.
Oil clearance = Inner diameter of the bushing [b] -

Outer diameter of the shaft [a].
Maximum oil clearance:
0.07 mm (0.0028 in.)
If oil clearance exceeds the maximum, replace the
vane pump assembly.

2. INSPECT VANE PUMP ROTOR AND VANE PUMP
PLATE CLEARANCE
Thickness (a) Using a micrometer, measure the thickness of the
vane pump plates.
Standard thickness:
1.405 to 1.411 mm (0.05531 to 0.05555 in.)
If the thickness is not within the specified range,
replace the vane pump assembly.

between the side face of the vane pump rotor
groove and the vane pump plates.
Maximum clearance:
0.03 mm (0.0012 in.)
If clearance exceeds the maximum, replace the
