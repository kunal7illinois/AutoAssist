Deceleration Force Control
The ECT ECU determines the gear position when the accelerator pedal is OFF (released completely) in
accordance with the operation of the accelerator pedal (released suddenly or slowly) during deceleration.
In this way, preventing unnecessary upshifts and downshifts when the accelerator pedal is OFF and ensuring
smooth acceleration when the vehicle needs to accelerate again.
