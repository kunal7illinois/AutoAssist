EG-6 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
3. Cylinder Head
(cid:3) The taper squish combustion chamber is used to realize the engine’s knocking resistance and fuel
efficiency.
(cid:3) An upright intake port has been used to achieve a highly efficient intake.
(cid:3) Installing the injectors in the cylinder head enables the injectors to inject fuel as close as possible to the
combustion chamber. This prevents the fuel from adhering to the intake port walls, which reduces HC
exhaust emissions.
(cid:3) The routing of the water bypass jacket in the cylinder head has been optimized for improved cooling
performance. In addition, a water bypass passage has been provided below the exhaust ports to reduce the
number of parts and to achieve weight reduction.
