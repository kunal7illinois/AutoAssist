DESCRIPTION
The skid control ECU receives the signals from the ECM, steering angle sensor, and yaw rate and
acceleration sensor via the CAN communication system.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When either of the following is detected: BC
U0073/94 1. Bus OFF state continues for 300 msec. CAN communication system
2. The ECU detects that it cannot send a signal.
When either of the following is detected:
1. At a vehicle speed of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more, the skid
control ECU receives data that is out of range from the
CAN communication system
U0100/65 engine.
(Skid control ECU to ECM)
2. At a vehicle speed of 4 mph (6 km/h) or more, the skid
control ECU receives abnormal data from the engine (5
cycles).
When any r of the following is detected:
