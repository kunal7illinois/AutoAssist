*: The TWC has the capability to store oxygen. The OSC and the emission purification capacity of the
TWC are mutually related. The ECM determines whether the catalyst has deteriorated, based on the
calculated OSC value (See page ES-249).

concentration. In order to continuously monitor the slight
15,000 variation of the HO2 sensor signal while the engine is
running, the impedance* of the sensor is measured by

the ECM. The ECM determines that there is a
Ω 100 malfunction in the sensor when the measured
impedance deviates from the standard range.
