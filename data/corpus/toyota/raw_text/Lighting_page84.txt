LIGHTING – FOG LIGHT ASSEMBLY
ADJUSTMENT
HINT:
It is possible that a bulb is incorrectly installed, affecting fog
light aim. Bulb installation should be considered prior to
performing the adjustment procedure.
1. VEHICLE PREPARATION FOR FOG LIGHT AIM
(a) Prepare the vehicle according to the following
conditions:
• Ensure there is no damage or deformation to the
body around the fog lights.
• Fill the fuel tank.
• Make sure that the oil is filled to the specified
level.
• Make sure that the coolant is filled to the
specified level.
• Inflate the tires to the appropriate pressure.
• Unload the trunk and vehicle, ensuring that the
spare tire, tools, and jack are in their original
positions.
• Sit a person of average weight (68 kg, 150 lb) in
the driver's seat.
• Vehicles with height adjustable suspension
should set the vehicle height to the lowest setting
prior to adjusting the fog light aim.
2. PREPARATION FOR FOG LIGHT AIMING
(a) Prepare the vehicle:
• Place the vehicle in a location that is dark
enough to clearly observe the cutoff line. The
cutoff line is a distinct line, below which light from
the fog lights can be observed and above which it
cannot.
• Place the vehicle at a 90° angle to the wall.
7.62 m (25 ft) • Create a 7.62 m (25 ft) distance between the
or 3 m (9.84 ft) vehicle (fog light bulb center) and the wall.

• Make sure that the vehicle is on a level surface.
• Bounce the vehicle up and down to settle the
LI
suspension.
NOTICE:
A distance of 7.62 m (25 ft) between the
vehicle (fog light bulb center) and the wall is
necessary for proper aim adjustment. If
unavailable, secure a distance of exactly 3 m
(9.84 ft) for check and adjustment. (The target
zone will change with the distance, so follow
the instructions in the illustration.)
(b) Prepare a piece of thick white paper (approximately
2 m (6.6 ft) (height) x 4 m (13.1 ft) (width)) to use as
a screen.
(c) Draw a vertical line down the center of the screen (V
line).
