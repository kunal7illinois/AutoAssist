(3) Checking the contact pressure of the terminal:
Prepare a spare male terminal. Insert it into a
female terminal, and check for ample tension
when inserting and after full engagement.
NOTICE:
When testing a gold-plated female terminal,
IN
always use a gold-plated male terminal.

(d) REPAIR METHOD OF CONNECTOR TERMINAL
(1) If there is any foreign matter on the terminal,
CORRECT INCORRECT
clean the contact point with compressed air or a
cloth. Never rub the contact point using
sandpaper as the plating may come off.
(2) If there is abnormal contact pressure, replace
the female terminal. If the male terminal is gold-
plated (gold color), use a gold-plated female
terminal; if it is silver-plated (silver color), use a
silver-plated female terminal.

(3) Damaged, deformed, or corroded terminals
should be replaced. If the terminal does not lock
into the housing, the housing may have to be
replaced.
(e) HANDLING OF WIRE HARNESS
(1) If removing a wire harness, check the wiring and
INCORRECT clamping before proceeding so that it can be
INCORRECT
restored in the same way.
(2) Never twist, pull or slacken the wire harness
more than necessary.
(3) The wire harness should never come into
contact with a high temperature part, or rotating,
moving, vibrating or sharp-edged parts. Avoid
contact with panel edges, screw tips and other
sharp items.
(4) When installing parts, never pinch the wire
INCORRECT harness.
(5) Never cut or break the cover of the wire harness.
If it is cut or broken, replace it or repair it with
D101266E01 vinyl tape.
