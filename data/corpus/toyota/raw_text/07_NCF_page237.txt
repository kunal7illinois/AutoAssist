CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE CH-73
12. Multi-Mode Automatic Transmission
General
By moving the shift lever to the front (“+” position) or to the rear (“-” position), the driver can select the
desired shift range position. Thus, the driver is able to shift gears with a manual-like feel.
(cid:3) This Multi-mode automatic transmission is designed to allow the driver to switch the gear ranges; not
for manually selecting single gears.
(cid:3) An S mode indicator light, which illuminates when the S mode position is selected and a shift range
indicator light, which indicates the range position, have been provided in the combination meter.
(cid:3) When the vehicle is being driven at a prescribed speed or higher, any attempt to shift down the range by
through the operation of the shift lever will not be executed, in order to protect the mechanism of the
automatic transaxle. In this case, the ECM sounds the buzzer in the combination meter twice to alert the
driver.
