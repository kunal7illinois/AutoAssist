BODY ELECTRICAL - SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM BE-145
3. SRS Driver and Front Passenger Airbags
SRS driver and front passenger airbags contain two sets of initiators and propellants. The airbag sensor
assembly helps optimize the airbag inflation speed by controlling the inflation timing of these initiators.
4. Front Airbag Sensor
Front airbag sensor uses an electrical type deceleration sensor. Based on the deceleration of the vehicle during
a frontal collision, distortion is created in the sensor and converted into an electrical signal. Accordingly, the
extent of the initial collision can be accurately detected.
5. SRS Knee Airbag
The knee airbag deploys simultaneously with the front airbag in a frontal collision. With the deployment of
the knee airbag, the driver’s lower body is restricted, thus enhancing the excellent passenger protection
provided by the seat belt and front airbag.
