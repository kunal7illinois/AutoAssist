DTC P1550 Battery Current Sensor Circuit
DTC P1551 Battery Current Sensor Circuit Low
DTC P1552 Battery Current Sensor Circuit High
DESCRIPTION
Sensor Output Voltage
ES
(V)
(A)
Current
A110645E01
The battery current sensor installed on the positive (+) battery terminal detects the amount of current
supplied from the generator.
The battery current sensor changes current to voltage (at the positive (+) battery terminal) and sends it to
the ECM. The ECM controls the voltage of the generator based on the signals from the battery current
sensor.
