HINT:
• If the temperature of the battery is low, the
inspection cannot be performed correctly. If
the result of the test is less than 2.2 V,
perform the test again after leaving the
battery in a place at a temperature of 18°C
(64°F) for 30 minutes or more.
• Read the voltage immediately after the
switch is pressed. When 0.8 seconds have
passed after the switch is pressed, the
automatic power-off function starts and the
resistance applied to the battery will cease.
The voltage of the battery will be 2.5 V or
more.
• Press the switch at least 3 times before
reading the voltage. If the battery has just
been returned to 18°C (64°F), the voltage
may be unusually high for the first or second
voltage reading.
