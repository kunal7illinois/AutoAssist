7. INSPECT CHAIN SUB-ASSEMBLY
(a) Pull the chain with a force of 147 N (15 kgf, 33 lbf)
as shown in the illustration.
(b) Using vernier calipers, measure the length of 15
links.
Measuring Area Maximum chain elongation:
136.9 mm (5.390 in.)
NOTICE:
Perform the measurement at 3 random places.
1 2 3 4 5 6 15
Use the average of the measurements.
A135727E01
If the elongation is greater than the maximum,
replace the chain.
8. INSPECT NO. 2 CHAIN SUB-ASSEMBLY
(a) Pull the chain with a force of 147 N (15 kgf, 33 lbf)
as shown in the illustration.
(b) Using vernier calipers, measure the length of 15
links.
Measuring Area Maximum chain elongation:
EM
137.6 mm (5.417 in.)
NOTICE:
Perform the measurement at 3 random places.
1 2 3 4 5 6 15
Use the average of the measurements.
A135727E04
If the elongation is greater than the maximum,
replace the chain.
9. INSPECT CRANKSHAFT TIMING SPROCKET
(a) Wrap the chain around the sprocket.
(b) Using vernier calipers, measure the sprocket
diameter with the chain.
Minimum sprocket diameter (with chain):
61.4 mm (2.417 in.)
HINT:
The vernier calipers must contact the chain rollers
for the measurement.
If the diameter is less than the minimum, replace the
chain and sprocket.

(a) Wrap the chain around the sprocket.
(b) Using vernier calipers, measure the sprocket
diameter with the chain.
Minimum sprocket diameter (with chain):
61.4 mm (2.417 in.)
HINT:
The vernier calipers must contact the chain rollers
for the measurement.
If the diameter is less than the minimum, replace the
chain and sprocket.
