8. Flex Lock-up Clutch Control
(cid:3) In addition to the conventional lock-up timing control, flex lock-up clutch control is used.
(cid:3) This flex lock-up clutch control regulates solenoid valve SL2 as an intermediate mode between the ON
and OFF operations of the lock-up clutch.
(cid:3) The flex lock-up clutch control operates during acceleration, in the 4th and 5th gear in the D range, and
during deceleration, in the 4th and 5th gear in the D range, and in the 4th gear in the 4 range.
(cid:3) During acceleration, the partition control of the power transmission between the lock-up clutch and torque
converter greatly boosts the transmission efficiency in accordance with the driving conditions, improving
the fuel economy.
(cid:3) During deceleration, the lock-up clutch is made to operate. Therefore the fuel-cut area is expanded and
fuel economy is improved.
