ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-121
6. Dual VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing-intelligent) System
General
(cid:3) The dual VVT-i system is designed to control the intake and exhaust camshafts within a range of 40(cid:4) and
35(cid:4) respectively (of Crankshaft Angle) to provide valve timing that is optimally suited to the engine
condition. This improves torque in all the speed ranges as well as increasing fuel economy, and reducing
exhaust emissions.

*: Oil Control Valve
(cid:3) By using the engine speed, intake air volume, throttle position and engine coolant temperature, the ECM
calculates optimal valve timing for each driving condition and controls the camshaft timing oil control
valve. In addition, the ECM uses signals from the camshaft position sensor and the crankshaft position
sensor to detect the actual valve timing, thus providing feedback control to achieve the target valve
timing.
