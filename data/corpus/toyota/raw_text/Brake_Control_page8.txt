BC–8
BRAKE CONTROL – ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM
Operation description
The skid control ECU detects wheel lock based on
speed signals it receives from the wheel speed
sensors. Based on this information, the skid control
ECU controls the pump motor and solenoid valves.
The pump motor and solenoid valves are used to
prevent wheel lock by controlling the hydraulic
pressure applied to the brakes at each wheel. The
ABS warning light will come on when the system is
malfunctioning.
