ES–301
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
P050A:
Accumulated mass air flow Varies with ECT (Example: Less than 42.5 g)
P050B:
Accumulated time when ignition timing retard is cut off 5 seconds or more
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using an intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data
can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine was
warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the time of
ES
a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P050A AND/OR P050B)
(a) Connect an intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Select the following the menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read the DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC Output) Proceed to
P050A and/or P050B A
P050A and/or P050B and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs other than P050A and P050B are output,
troubleshoot those DTCs first.
B GO TO DTC CHART (See page ES-63)

2 READ VALUE USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (FUEL TRIM)
HINT:
Calculate the total fuel trim values to check the characteristic
deviation of the mass air flow meter.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / SHORT
FT #1 and LONG FT #1.
(e) Read the values displayed on the tester.
(f) Add together the SHORT FT #1 and LONG FT #1 values
to obtain the total FUEL TRIM.
