CH-64 CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
Transmission Control Switch and Park/Neutral Position Switch
The ECT ECU and ECM use these switches to detect the shift lever position.
(cid:3) The park/neutral position switch sends the P, R, N and D position signals to both the ECM and ECT ECU.
The ECM transmits signals to the combination meter for the shift position indicator light (P, R, N and
D) in response to the signal it receives from the switch.
(cid:3) The transmission control switch is installed inside the shift lever assembly. Switch terminal S is used to
detect whether the shift lever is in the D position or S mode position, and terminals SFTU and SFTD are
used to detect the operating conditions of the shift lever (front [+ position] or rear [- position]) if S mode
is selected. By transmitting signals to the ECM, the transmission control switch turns on both the shift
range indicator light and S mode indicator light when the shift lever is moved to the S mode position,
and indicates the selected range position through shift range indicator light.
