Key Interlock Solenoid
Key Interlock
The activation of the key interlock solenoid that Lock Pin Solenoid
is mounted on the upper column bracket moves
the lock pin to restrict the movement of the key
cylinder. Therefore, if the shift lever is shifted to
any position other than “P”, the ignition key
cannot be moved from “ACC” to the “LOCK”
position.

System Operation
(cid:3) Models with smart key system: The shift lock ECU uses the P detection switch to detect the shift lever
position, and receives inputs from the stop light switch and the main body ECU. Upon receiving these
signals, the shift lock ECU turns ON the shift lock solenoid in order to release the shift lock.
(cid:3) Models without smart key system: The shift lock ECU uses the P detection switch to detect the shift lever
position, and receives inputs from the stop light switch and the ignition switch. Upon receiving these
signals, the shift lock ECU turns ON the key interlock solenoid and the shift lock solenoid in order to
release the key interlock and shift lock.
(cid:3) A shift lock override button, which manually overrides the shift lock mechanism, is used.
