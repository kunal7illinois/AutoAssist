(b) P043F: Reference orifice high-flow
In operation B, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure (vacuum) through the reference orifice.
The EVAP system pressure is then measured by the ECM using the canister pressure sensor to
determine the reference pressure. If the pressure is higher than -1.057 kPa-g (-7.93 mmHg-g), the ECM
interprets this as a high-flow malfunction in the reference orifice, and stops the EVAP system monitor. The
ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
