BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
9 CHECK SPEED SENSOR AND SPEED SENSOR ROTOR SERRATIONS
(a) Reconnect the skid control sensor wire.
Skid Control ECU Harness Side (b) Reconnect the rear speed sensor connector.
Connector Front View: (c) Connect the oscilloscope to the rear speed sensor
terminal of the skid control ECU.
(d) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
RR+ RL-
A26 OK:
The same waveform is output from all the 4 wheels
and there is no noise or interference in the
waveform.
HINT:
• As the vehicle speed (wheel revolution speed)
RR- RL+
increases, a cycle of the waveform narrows and the
output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
BC
Normal Signal Waveform:
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated due to
speed sensor rotor's scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to it.

10 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Reconnect the skid control ECU connector.
(b) Clear the DTC (See page BC-141).
(c) Start the engine.
(d) Drive the vehicle at the speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) or
more for at least 60 seconds.
(e) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-141).
Result
Condition Proceed to
DTCs (C0210/33 and/or C0215/34) are output A
DTCs (C0210/33 and/or C0215/34) are not output B
HINT:
If troubleshooting has been carried out according to the
Problem Symptoms Table, refer back to the table and
proceed to the next step (See page BC-134).
