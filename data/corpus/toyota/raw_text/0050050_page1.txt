2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P2111 Throttle Actuator Control System - Stuck Open
Throttle Actuator Control System - Stuck
DTC P2112
Closed
DESCRIPTION
The throttle actuator is operated by the ECM, and opens and closes the throttle valve using gears. The
opening angle of the throttle valve is detected by the Throttle Position (TP) sensor, which is mounted on
the throttle body. The TP sensor provides feedback to the ECM in order that it can control the throttle
actuator, and therefore the throttle valve, appropriately in response to driver inputs.
HINT:
ES
This ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System) does not use a throttle cable.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
• Throttle actuator
Throttle actuator does not close when signaled by ECM
P2111 • Throttle body assembly
(1 trip detection logic)
• Throttle valve
• Throttle actuator
Throttle actuator does not open when signaled by ECM
P2112 • Throttle body assembly
(1 trip detection logic)
• Throttle valve
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM determines that there is a malfunction in the ETCS when the throttle valve remains at a fixed
angle despite a high drive current from the ECM. The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets a DTC.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set when the accelerator pedal is fully depressed
and released quickly (to fully open and close the throttle valve) after the engine is next started.
