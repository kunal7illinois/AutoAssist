2) Rebound Spring
The function of the built-in rebound spring is to combine with the function of the coil spring in order to
restrain the elongation of the entire suspension during rebounds. Consequently, only the function of the
coil spring is applied when the suspension stroke is small during normal driving, in order to realize a soft
and comfortable ride. However, when the inner wheel makes large rebounds, such as when the vehicle
is cornering, the functions of both the rebound spring and the coil spring are combined in order to reduce
the elongation of the entire suspension. As a result, the vehicle has excellent maneuverability and
stability.
