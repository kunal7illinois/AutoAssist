BODY ELECTRICAL - SMART KEY SYSTEM BE-113
Entry Unlock
a) When a key enters any actuation area of the door oscillators, the certification ECU judges and certifies
the key ID code received from the tuner.
b)After the key certification OK is confirmed, the certification ECU transmits an unlock stand-by signal
to the touch sensor of the relevant door.
c) At the same time, the certification ECU transmits the lighting signals to the foot light on the outside rear
view mirror and interior lights (engine switch illumination and interior light), and turns ON these
illuminations (Entry Illumination Function).
d)If the touch sensor is touched during this condition, the certification ECU transmits a door unlock signal
to the main body ECU, and unlocks the door.
e) The certification ECU sounds the wireless door lock buzzer twice and main body ECU blinks the hazard
warning light twice as an answerback for entry unlock.
