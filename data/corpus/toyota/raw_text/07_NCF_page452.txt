BE-118 BODY ELECTRICAL - SMART KEY SYSTEM
3) Inside Luggage Room
a) When the trunk lid is closed while the key is still inside the luggage room and all doors are locked,
the certification ECU recognizes that a trunk lid close condition has occurred based on signals from
the main body ECU.
b)The certification ECU receives this signal, and transmits a request signal for the trunk inner oscillator
to form an actuation area.
c) The key receives this signal and returns the ID code to the tuner.
d)The certification ECU judges and certifies the ID code, and checks the location of the key. The ECU
sounds the wireless door lock buzzer for 2 seconds to inform the driver.
e) If the trunk open switch is turned ON (pressed) while the key is inside the luggage room, the
certification ECU sends another request signal for the trunk inner oscillator to form an actuation area.
The ECU judges and certifies the key and checks its location, before transmitting a trunk open signal
to the main body ECU.
f) The main body ECU receives the signal and operates the luggage door lock motor to open the trunk.
