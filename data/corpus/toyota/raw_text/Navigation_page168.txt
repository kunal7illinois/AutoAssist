Speaker Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The sound signal that has been amplified by the stereo component amplifier is sent to the speakers from
the stereo component amplifier through this circuit.
If there is a short in this circuit, the stereo component amplifier detects it and stops output to the speakers.
Thus sound cannot be heard from the speakers even if there is no malfunction in the stereo component
amplifier or speakers.
