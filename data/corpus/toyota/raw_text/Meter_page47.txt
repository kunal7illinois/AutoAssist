METER – METER / GAUGE SYSTEM
Speedometer Malfunction
DESCRIPTION
The meter CPU receives vehicle speed signals from the skid control ECU via the CAN communication
lines (CAN No. 1 Bus). The vehicle speed sensor detects the voltage that varies according to the vehicle
speed. The skid control ECU supplies power to the vehicle speed sensor. The skid control ECU detects
vehicle speed signals based on the pulses of the voltage.
