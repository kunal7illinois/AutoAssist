BP-88 BODY PANEL REPLACEMENT
CAUTION LABEL ATTACHMENT POSITION
After using a degreasing agent to clean the surfaces of the body where the caution labels will be attached, attach the
caution labels to the positions shown in the illustration.
HINT:
1) Attach each caution label with its orientation the same as the numbers shown in the illustration.
2) Make sure the caution label is not attached over a spot weld.
3) When attaching the caution label, make sure not to touch the label’s adhesive surface.
4) To prevent the edges of the caution label from peeling, apply extra pressure to the label’s periphery.
5) If the work area’s temperature is 5(cid:1)C or less, the caution label’s adhesive will deteriorate. It is
recommended that you heat the label to 20 to 40(cid:1)C.
