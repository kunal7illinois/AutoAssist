2. P2420: Vent valve stuck open (vent)
In operation C, the vent valve turns ON (closes) and the EVAP system pressure is then measured by
the ECM, using the canister pressure sensor, to conduct an EVAP leak check. If the pressure does not
increase when the vent valve is open, the ECM interprets this as the vent valve being stuck open. The
ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
