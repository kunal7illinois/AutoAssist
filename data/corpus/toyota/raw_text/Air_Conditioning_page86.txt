AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
Air Mix Damper Control Servo Motor Circuit
DTC B1446/46
(Driver Side)
DESCRIPTION
The air mix damper servo sends pulse signals to inform the air conditioning amplifier of the damper
position. The air conditioning amplifier activates the motor (normal, reverse) based on the signals to move
the air mix damper (driver seat) to any position. As a result, the amount of air passing through the heater
core after passing through the evaporator is adjusted, and the temperature of the air blowing toward the
driver seat side is controlled.
HINT:
Confirm that no mechanical problem is present because this diagnostic code can be output when either a
damper link or damper is mechanically locked.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
Air mix damper position sensor value does not change • Air mix control servo motor
B1446/46 even if air conditioning amplifier operates air mix control • Air conditioning harness
