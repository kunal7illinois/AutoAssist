TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
1. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM
(a) A tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is
equipped with a tire pressure sensor and a
transmitter and is installed in a tire wheel assembly.
The sensor measures the tire pressure. The
measured value and transmitter ID are transmitted
to the tire pressure warning antenna and receiver on
the body as radio waves and then sent to the tire
pressure warning ECU from the tire pressure
warning antenna and receiver. If the transmitter ID
has already been registered, the ECU compares the
measured air pressure value with the standard
value. When the value is less than the standard
value registered in the tire pressure monitor ECU,
the warning light on the combination meter comes
TW
on.
• For the differences in the air pressure settings by
the type of tires, a tire pressure warning reset
switch has been adopted.

2. WHEN TIRE PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT IS LIT
(a) When the tire pressure warning light does not go off,
or when it comes on during driving, check tire
pressure. If the tire pressure warning light comes on
within several hours after adjusting the tire
pressure, the tire may have a slow air leak.
(b) Under the following conditions, the system may not
function properly.
• Facilities or devices that use similar radio
frequencies are located in the vicinity of the
vehicle.
