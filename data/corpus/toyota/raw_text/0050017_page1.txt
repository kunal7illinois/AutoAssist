Oxygen Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction
DTC P0141
(Bank 1 Sensor 2)
DESCRIPTION
ES
Refer to DTC P0136 (see page ES-129).
HINT:
• When any of these DTCs are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. The ECM turns off the Heated
Oxygen (HO2) Sensor heater in fail-safe mode. Fail-safe mode continues until the ignition switch is
turned OFF.
• The ECM provides a pulse width modulated control circuit to adjust the current through the heater. The
HO2 sensor heater circuit uses a relay on the B+ side of the circuit.
