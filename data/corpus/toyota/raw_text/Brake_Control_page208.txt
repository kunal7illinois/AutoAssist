DESCRIPTION
The speed sensors detect wheel speed and transmit the signals to the ECU. These signals are used for
control of the ABS control system. Each of the front and rear rotors have 48 serrations.
When the rotors rotate, the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet in the speed sensor
induces an AC voltage.
Since the frequency of this AC voltage changes in direct proportion to the speed of the rotor, the
frequency is used by the ECU to detect the speed of each wheel.
DTCs C1275/75 to C1278/78 can be deleted when the speed sensor sends a vehicle speed signal or the
Test Mode ends. DTCs from C1275/75 to C1278/78 are output only in the Test Mode.
