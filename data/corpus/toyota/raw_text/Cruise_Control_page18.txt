DATA LIST / ACTIVE TEST
1. READ DATA LIST
HINT:
Using the intelligent tester's DATA LIST allows switch,
sensor, actuator, and other item values to be read
without removing any parts. Reading the DATA LIST
early in troubleshooting is one way to save time.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Read the DATA LIST according to the display on the
tester.
