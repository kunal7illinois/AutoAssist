10. CHECK VALVE CLEARANCE
No. 1 Cylinder TDC/Compression
(a) Check only the valves indicated.
(1) Using a feeler gauge, measure the clearance
between the valve lifter and camshaft.
IN
Standard valve clearance (cold)
Item Standard Condition
EX
Intake 0.19 to 0.29 mm (0.0075 to 0.0114 in.)
Exhaust 0.38 to 0.48 mm (0.0150 to 0.0189 in.)
(2) Record any out-of-specification valve clearance

measurements. They will be used later to
determine the required replacement valve
clearance lifters.
(b) Turn the crankshaft 1 revolution (360°) and set the
No. 4 cylinder to the TDC/compression.
(c) Check only the valves indicated.
