2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
2. DTC P0451: Canister pressure sensor noise or fixed/flat
If the canister pressure sensor voltage output fluctuates rapidly for 10 seconds, the ECM stops the
EVAP system monitor. The ECM interprets this as noise from the canister pressure sensor, and stops
the EVAP system monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
Alternatively, if the sensor voltage output does not change for 10 seconds, the ECM interprets this as
the sensor being fixed/flat, and stops the monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
(Both the malfunctions are detected by 2 trip detection logic).
3. DTC P0452: Canister pressure sensor voltage low
If the canister pressure sensor output [pressure] is below 42.1 kPa-a (315.9 mmHg-a), the ECM
interprets this as an open or short circuit malfunction in the canister pressure sensor or its circuit, and
stops the EVAP system monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (1 trip detection
logic).
4. DTC P0453: Canister pressure sensor voltage high
ES
If the canister pressure sensor output [pressure] is 123.8 kPa-a (928.4 mmHg-a) or more, the ECM
interprets this as an open or short circuit malfunction in the canister pressure sensor or its circuit, and
stops the EVAP system monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (1 trip detection
logic).
