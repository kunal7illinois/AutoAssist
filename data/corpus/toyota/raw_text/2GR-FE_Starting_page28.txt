DATA LIST / ACTIVE TEST
1. READ DATA LIST
HINT:
Using the intelligent tester to read the Data List allows
the values or states of switches, sensors, actuators and
other items to be read without removing any parts. This
non-intrusive inspection can be very useful as
intermittent conditions or signals may be discovered
before parts or wiring is disturbed. Reading the DATA
LIST information early in troubleshooting is one way to
save diagnostic time.
(a) Connect the intelligent tester (with CAN VIM) to the
DLC3.
When using the intelligent tester with the engine
switch off, turn on and off any of the door courtesy
light switches repeatedly at 1.5 or less second
intervals until communication between the tester
and vehicle starts.
(b) Turn the engine switch on (IG).
(c) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST.
(d) Read the DATA LIST.
