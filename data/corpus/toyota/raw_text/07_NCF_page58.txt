2. Construction
(cid:3) Instead of the round-shaped conductor wires used in the conventional starter, the PS type starter uses
square-shaped conductors. In this type of construction, square-shaped conductors can achieve the same
conditions as those achieved by winding numerous round-shaped conductor wires, but without increasing
the mass. As a result, the output torque is increased, and the armature coil is more compact.
(cid:3) Because the surface of the square-shaped conductors that are used in the armature coil functions as a
commutator, the overall length of the PS type starter has been shortened.

(cid:3) Instead of the field coils used in the conventional starter, the PS type starter uses two types of permanent
magnets: the main magnets and the interpolar magnets. The main and interpolar magnets are arranged
alternately inside the yoke. This allows the magnetic flux generated between the main and interpolar
magnets to be added to the magnetic flux generated by the main magnets. In addition to increasing the
amount of magnetic flux, this construction shortens the overall length of the yoke.
