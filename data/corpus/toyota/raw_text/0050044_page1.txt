DESCRIPTION
ES
The ECM continuously monitors its own internal memory status, internal circuits, and output signals
transmitted to the throttle actuator. This self-check ensures that the ECM is functioning properly. If any
malfunction is detected, the ECM sets the appropriate DTC and illuminates the MIL.
The ECM memory status is diagnosed by internal mirroring of the main CPU and the sub CPU to detect
Random Access Memory (RAM) errors. The two CPUs also perform continuous mutual monitoring. The
ECM illuminates the MIL and sets a DTC if: 1) outputs from the two CPUs are different or deviate from the
standards, 2) the signals sent to the throttle actuator deviate from the standards, 3) a malfunction is found
in the throttle actuator supply voltage, and 4) any other ECM malfunction is found.
