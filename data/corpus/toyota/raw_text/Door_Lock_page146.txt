(b) Oscillator (front door oscillator, front and rear indoor
oscillator, luggage compartment inner oscillator,
luggage compartment outer oscillator)
Each oscillator transmits the request signal received
from the certification ECU, and forms an electrical
key detection area to detect the presence of an
electrical key. The detection area formed by front
door oscillator and luggage compartment outer
oscillator is approximately 0.7 to 1.0 m (2.3 to 3.3 ft)
from the outside handle of front door or the center of
the rear bumper.
• The detection area of front door oscillator is
formed by transmitting a request signal every
0.25 seconds while the engine switch is off and
each door is locked. In this way, it detects the
proximity of an electrical key. During entry lock,
the detection area is formed with the lock switch
on.
• The detection area of the luggage compartment
outer oscillator is formed when the power
luggage door open switch is on.
• The detection area of the indoor oscillator (front
and rear) is formed when the driver door is
DL opened or closed, entry luggage compartment
open, electrical key lock-in prevention during
start ignition, when a warning is activated, or
when the lock switch is on.
• The detection area of the luggage compartment
inner oscillator is formed when the luggage
compartment door is closed, entry luggage
compartment open, electrical key lock-in
prevention, the luggage compartment open
switch or lock switch is pressed.
