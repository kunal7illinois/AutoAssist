BC–216
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When any of the following is detected:
• At a vehicle speed of 4.3 mph (7 km/h) or more, when the
PMC terminal voltage is over 0.86 V, it does not change
by 0.005 V or more for 30 seconds.
• Noise occurs in the PMC terminal 7 times or more within
5 seconds.
• Master cylinder pressure sensor
• When the stop light switch is OFF, the PMC terminal
• Master cylinder pressure sensor circuit
C1246/46 voltage is more than 0.86 V or less than 0.3 V for 5
• Stop light switch circuit
seconds or more.
• Brake actuator assembly
• With the IG1 terminal voltage between 9.5 and 17.2 V, the
VCM terminal voltage is not between 4.4 and 5.6 V for 1.2
seconds or more.
• When the VCM terminal voltage between 4.4 and 5.6 V,
the PCM terminal voltage is not between 0.14 and 4.85 V
for 1.2 seconds or more.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
NOTICE:
When replacing the brake actuator assembly, perform zero point calibration (See page BC-119).
BC
1 CHECK STOP LIGHT OPERATION
(a) Check that the stop light comes on when the brake pedal
is depressed, and goes off when the brake pedal is
released.
OK
Condition Illumination Condition
Brake pedal depressed ON
Brake pedal released OFF
NG INSPECT STOP LIGHT CIRCUIT
OK
2 READ VALUE OF INTELLIGENT TESTER (MASTER CYLINDER PRESSURE SENSOR)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Select the Data List mode on the intelligent tester.
ABS / VSC:
Item (Display) Measurement Item / Range (Display) Normal Condition
Master cylinder pressure sensor 1 reading / min.: 0 V,
MAS CYL PRESS 1 When brake pedal is released: 0.3 to 0.5 V
max.: 5 V
(d) Check that the brake fluid pressure value of the master
cylinder pressure sensor observed on the intelligent
tester changes when the brake pedal is depressed.
OK:
When the pedal is depressed, voltage displayed on
the intelligent tester increases.
NG REPLACE BRAKE ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY
OK
