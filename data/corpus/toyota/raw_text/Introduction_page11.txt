(2) When disconnecting vacuum hoses, use tags to
identify where they should be reconnected.
(3) After completing any hose related repairs,
double check that the vacuum hoses are
properly connected. The label under the hood
shows the proper layout.
(4) When using a vacuum gauge, never force the
hose onto a connector that is too large. If a hose
has been stretched, air may leak. Use a step-
down adapter if necessary.
