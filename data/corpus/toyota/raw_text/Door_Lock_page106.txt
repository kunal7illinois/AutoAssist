(b) The wireless transmitter operational range differs
depending on the situation.

user, the way the transmitter is held and the
location.
(2) In certain areas, the operational range will be
reduced due to the vehicle body shape and the
influence of the surrounding environment.
(3) Since the transmitter uses weak radio waves,
the operational range may be reduced or the
transmitter may not function if interference or
stronger radio waves occur in the area where
the transmitter is used.
(4) When the battery is low, the operational range is
reduced and/or the transmitter may not function.
HINT:
If the transmitter has been left in a place that is
exposed to direct sunlight, such as on the
instrument panel, the battery may be weakened
or other problems may occur.
