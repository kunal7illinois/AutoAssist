ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-91
2. Oil Pump
(cid:1) A compact cycloid rotor type oil pump directly driven by the crankshaft is used.
(cid:1) This oil pump uses an internal relief method which circulates relief oil to the suction passage in the oil
pump. This aims to minimize oil level change in the oil pan, reduce friction, and reduce air mixing rate
in the oil.

3. Oil Jet
(cid:1) Oil jets for cooling and lubricating the pistons have been provided in the cylinder block, in the center of
the right and left banks.
(cid:1) These oil jets contain a check valve to prevent oil from being fed when the oil pressure is low. This prevents
the overall oil pressure in the engine from dropping.
