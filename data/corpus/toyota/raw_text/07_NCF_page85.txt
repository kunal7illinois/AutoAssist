EG-58 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
9. Fuel Pump Control
A fuel cut control is used to stop the fuel pump once when any of the SRS airbags is deployed. In this system,
the airbag deployment signal from the airbag sensor assembly is detected by the ECM, and it turns OFF the
circuit opening relay. After the fuel cut control has been activated, turning the ignition switch from OFF to
ON cancels the fuel cut control, and the engine can be restarted.
