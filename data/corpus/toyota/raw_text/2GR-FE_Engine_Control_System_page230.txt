DESCRIPTION
The crankshaft position (CKP) sensor system consists of a crankshaft position sensor plate and a
magnetic coil.
The sensor plate has 34 teeth and is installed on the crankshaft. The pickup coil is made of windings, an
iron core and magnet. The sensor plate rotates and as each tooth passes through the pickup coil, a pulse
signal is created. The pickup coil generates 34 signals for each engine revolution. Based on these
signals, the ECM calculates the crankshaft position and engine RPM. Using these calculations, the fuel
injection time and ignition time are controlled.
