INSPECTION
Length
1. INSPECT GENERATOR BRUSH HOLDER ASSEMBLY
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the brush length.
Standard length:
9.5 to 11.5 mm (0.374 to 0.453 in.)
Minimum length:
4.5 mm (0.177 in.)
If the brush length is less than the minimum, replace
the generator brush holder assembly.

2. INSPECT GENERATOR ROTOR ASSEMBLY
Slip Ring
(a) Check the resistance.
(1) Measure the resistance between the slip rings.
Standard resistance:
2.3 to 2.7 Ω at 20°C (68°F)
If the result is not as specified, replace the
generator rotor assembly.
