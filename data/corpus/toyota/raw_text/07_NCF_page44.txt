(cid:4)COOLING SYSTEM
1. General
(cid:3) The cooling system uses a pressurized forced circulation system with open air type reservoir tank.
(cid:3) A thermostat with a bypass valve is located on the water inlet housing to maintain suitable temperature
distribution in the cooling system.
This prevents sudden jumps in temperature while the engine is warming up.
(cid:3) The flow of the engine coolant makes a U-turn in the cylinder block to ensure a smooth flow of the engine
coolant. In addition, a bypass passage is enclosed in the cylinder head and the cylinder block.
(cid:3) Warm water from the engine is sent to the throttle body to prevent freeze-up.
(cid:3) TOYOTA Genuine SLLC (Super Long Life Coolant) is used to extend the maintenance interval.
