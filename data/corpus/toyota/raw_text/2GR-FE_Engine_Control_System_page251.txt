DESCRIPTION
The exhaust camshaft's Variable Valve Timing (VVT) sensor consists of a magnet and MRE (Magneto
Resistance Element).
The exhaust camshaft has a sensor plate with 3 teeth on its outer circumference.
When the exhaust camshaft rotates, changes occur in the air gaps between the 3 teeth and MRE, which
affects the magnet. As a result, the resistance of the MRE material fluctuates. The VVT sensor converts
the exhaust camshaft rotation data to pulse signals, uses the pulse signals to determine the camshaft
angle, and sends it to the ECM.
