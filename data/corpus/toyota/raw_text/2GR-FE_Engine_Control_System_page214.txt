Required Sensors/Components (Main) Injector, Ignition coil, Spark plug
Crankshaft, Camshaft, Engine coolant temperature and intake air
Required Sensors/Components (Related)
temperature sensors and Mass air flow meter
Frequency of Operation Continuous
1,000 to 4,000 crankshaft revolutions: Emission related misfire
Duration
200 to 600 crankshaft revolutions: Catalyst damaged misfire
2 driving cycles: Emission related misfire
MIL Operation
MIL flashes immediately: Catalyst damaged misfire
