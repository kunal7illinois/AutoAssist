ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-43
2) TMMK Made Model
The non-contact type accelerator pedal position sensor uses a Hall IC, which is mounted on the
accelerator pedal arm.
(cid:1) The magnetic yoke that is mounted at the base of the accelerator pedal arm moves around the Hall IC
in accordance with the amount of effort that is applied to the accelerator pedal. The Hall IC converts
the changes in the magnetic flux that occur at that time into electrical signals, and outputs them in the
form of accelerator pedal effort to the ECM.
(cid:1) This accelerator pedal position sensor includes 2 Hall ICs and circuits for the main and sub signals.
It converts the accelerator pedal depressing angles into electric signals with two differing
characteristics and outputs them to the ECM.

Service Tip
The inspection method differs from the conventional accelerator pedal position sensor because
this sensor uses a hall IC. For details, refer to the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No.
