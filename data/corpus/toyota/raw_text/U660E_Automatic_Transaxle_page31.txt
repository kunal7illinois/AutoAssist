U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
MONITOR DRIVE PATTERN
1. MONITOR DRIVE PATTERN FOR ECT TEST
(a) Perform this drive pattern as one method to
simulate the detection conditions of the ECT
malfunctions. (The DTCs may not be detected due
to differences from the actual driving conditions. AX
Some codes may not be detected using this drive
pattern.)
HINT:
Preparation for driving
• Warm up the engine sufficiently. (Engine coolant
temperature should be 60°C (140°F) or higher)
• Drive the vehicle when the atmospheric
temperature is -10°C (14°F) or higher.
(Malfunction may not be detected when the
atmospheric temperature is less than -10°C
(14°F))
Notice on driving
• Drive the vehicle through all gears.
Stop to 1st to 2nd to 3rd to 4th to 5th to 6th (lock-
up ON).
• Confirm engine braking using the S position.
While driving in the 6 (S) position and 6th gear
lock-up, shift to the "-" position to down-shift from
6th to 5th, 5th to 4th, 4th to 3rd, 3rd to 2nd, 2nd
to 1st.
Check that proper engine braking occurs
whenever down-shift takes place.
• Repeat the above driving pattern three times or
more.
NOTICE:
• The monitor status can be checked using the
intelligent tester. When using the intelligent
tester, monitor status can be found in "OBD/
MOBD / ECT / DATA LIST".
• In the event that the drive pattern must be
interrupted (possibly due to traffic conditions
or other factors), the drive pattern can be
resumed and, in most cases, the monitor can
be completed.
• Perform this drive pattern on a road with the
fewest hills possible and strictly observe the
posted speed limits and traffic laws while
driving.
