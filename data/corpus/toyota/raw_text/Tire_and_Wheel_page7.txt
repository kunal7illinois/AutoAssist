TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
(e) When replacing the tire pressure warning valve and
transmitter;
(1) Take a note of the 7 digit number (transmitter ID)
written on the tire pressure warning valve and
transmitter when replacing it. Register the
transmitter IDs in the tire pressure warning ECU
after replacing the tire pressure warning valve
and transmitter and installing the tires and
wheels on the vehicle.
Tire pressure warning valve and transmitter:
Transmitter ID
(7 digit number)
TW
E128762E02
NOTICE:
The transmitter ID is written on the tire
pressure warning valve and transmitter. It
will be unable to be read after installing the
tire pressure warning valve and transmitter
on the tire and wheel. Therefore, take a note
of the transmitter ID before installing the tire
pressure warning valve and transmitter.
(f) When replacing the tire pressure warning ECU and
the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters; It
is necessary to perform the initialization (See page
TW-18) after the registration (See page TW-15).
(g) Precautions about the tire pressure;
• The tire pressures decrease naturally.
• In winter, tire pressure may decrease due to low
ambient temperatures (tire pressure decreases
by approximately 10 kPa (0.2 kgf/cm2, 1.45 psi)
for every 10°C (50°F) drop in the ambient
temperature). Therefore, the tire pressure
warning is more likely to operate if the tire
pressures are not adjusted appropriately. If the
daily temperature variation is large, pressurize
the tires high so that the tire pressures are
suitable under cold conditions. Incorrect tire
pressure warning operation becomes less likely.
3. IN CASE OF TIRE AND WHEEL REPLACEMENT
(a) When tires and wheels are replaced, always ensure
that each transmitter ID is correctly registered.
