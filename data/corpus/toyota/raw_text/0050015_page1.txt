DTC P0016
lation (Bank 1 Sensor A)
DESCRIPTION
In the VVT (Variable Valve Timing) system, the appropriate intake valve open and close timing is
controlled by the ECM. The ECM performs intake valve control by performing the following: 1) controlling
the camshaft and camshaft timing oil control valve, and operating the camshaft timing gear; and 2)
changing the relative positions of the gaps between the camshaft and crankshaft.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
• Mechanical system (Timing chain has jumped tooth or
Deviation in crankshaft and camshaft position sensor signals
P0016 chain stretched)
(2 trip detection logic)
• ECM ES
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM optimizes the valve timing by using the VVT (Variable Valve Timing) system to control the intake
camshaft. The VVT system includes the ECM, the Oil Control Valve (OCV) and the VVT controller.
The ECM sends a target duty-cycle control signal to the OCV. This control signal regulates the oil
pressure supplied to the VVT controller. The VVT controller can advance or retard the intake camshaft.
The ECM calibrates the intake valve timing by setting the intake camshaft to the most retarded angle while
the engine is idling. The ECM closes the OCV to retard the cam. The ECM stores this value as the VVT
learning value. When the difference between the target and actual intake valve timings is 5°CA
(Crankshaft Angle) or less, the ECM stores it.
If the VVT learning value matches the following conditions, the ECM determines the existence of a
malfunction in the VVT system, and sets the DTC.
• VVT learning value: Less than 25°CA, or more than 51°CA.
• Above condition continues for 18 seconds or more.
This DTC indicates that the angle between the intake camshaft and the crankshaft is incorrect due to
factors such as the timing chain having jumped a tooth.
This monitor begins to run after the engine has idled for 5 minutes.
