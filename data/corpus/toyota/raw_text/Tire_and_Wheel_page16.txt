TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
REGISTRATION
1. READ TRANSMITTER ID
Prepare the all transmitter ID data before starting
registration.
HINT:
• Read the registered transmitter IDs that are stored in
the ECU using the intelligent tester and note them
down.
• If reading stored transmitter IDs is impossible due to
malfunctions of components such as the tire pressure
warning antenna and receiver, remove the tires from
the wheels and check the IDs located on the tire
pressure warning valves and transmitters (See page
TW-6).
• When replacing the tire pressure warning ECU, read
the IDs stored in the old ECU using the intelligent
TW
tester.
• When replacing the tire pressure warning valves and
transmitters, note down the IDs written on the tire
pressure warning valves and transmitters.
