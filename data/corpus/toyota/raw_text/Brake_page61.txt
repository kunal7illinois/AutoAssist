BC–61
BRAKE CONTROL – ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM
4 RECONFIRM DTC
HINT:
This code is detected when a problem is identified in the
brake actuator assembly.
The solenoid circuit is in the brake actuator assembly.
Therefore, solenoid circuit inspection and solenoid unit
inspection cannot be performed. Be sure to check if the DTC
is output before replacing the brake actuator assembly.
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-21).
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Drive the vehicle at a speed of 12 mph (20 km/h) or more
for 30 seconds or more.
(d) Check if the same DTC is recorded (See page BC-21).
HINT:
Reinstall the sensors, connectors, etc. and restore the
vehicle to its prior condition before rechecking for DTCs.

DTC is output B
HINT:
• If the normal system code is output (the trouble code
is not output), slightly jiggle the connectors, wire
harnesses, and fuses of the brake actuator assembly.
Make sure that no DTCs are output.
• If any DTCs are output while jiggling a connector or
wire harness of the brake actuator (skid control ECU),
inspect and repair the connector or wire harness.
• It is suspected that the DTCs were output due to a
bad connection of the connector terminal.
