ES–236
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0504 Brake Switch "A" / "B" Correlation
DESCRIPTION
The stop light switch is a duplex system that transmits two signals: STP and ST1-. These two signals are
used by the ECM to monitor whether or not the brake system is working properly. If the signals, which
indicate the brake pedal is being depressed and released, are detected simultaneously, the ECM
interprets this as a malfunction in the stop light switch and sets the DTC.
HINT:
The normal conditions are as shown in the table below. The signals can be read using the intelligent
tester.
