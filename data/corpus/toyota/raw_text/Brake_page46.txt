BRAKE CONTROL – ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM
2 PERFORM TEST MODE INSPECTION (SIGNAL CHECK)
(a) Check if test mode (signal check) DTCs are detected
(See page BC-11).
Result
Condition Proceed to
Test mode (signal check) DTC is not output A
Test mode (signal check) DTC is output B
B Go to step 5
A
3 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL WAVEFORM
BC (a) Lift up the vehicle.
(b) Perform the inspection using an oscilloscope.
Skid Control ECU (Harness Side
(1) Disconnect the skid control ECU connector.
Connector Front View):
(2) Connect the oscilloscope to terminals of the skid
control ECU.
(3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
RL- RL+ RR- RR+ OK:
The same waveform is output from rear wheels
and there is no noise or interference in the
waveform.
HINT:
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
Normal Signal Waveform:
and the output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to the speed sensor.
GND
(4) Connect the connector.
NG CLEAN OR REPLACE SPEED SENSOR AND
SENSOR ROTOR

4 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Clear the DTCs (See page BC-21).
(b) Drive the vehicle at a speed of approximately 25 mph (40
km/h) or more for 60 seconds or more.
