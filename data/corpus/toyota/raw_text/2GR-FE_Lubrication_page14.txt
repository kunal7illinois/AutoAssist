(c) Check the side clearance.
(1) Using a feeler gauge and precision
straightedge, measure the clearance between
the rotors and precision straightedge, as shown
in the illustration.
Side clearance
Standard Maximum
0.030 to 0.090 mm (0.0012 to 0.0035 in.) 0.090 mm (0.0035 in.)
If the side clearance is greater than the
A128012
maximum, replace the timing chain cover.
(d) Check the body clearance.
(1) Using a feeler gauge, measure the clearance
between the timing chain cover and driven
rotor, as shown in the illustration.
Body clearance
Standard Maximum
0.250 to 0.325 mm (0.0098 to 0.0128 in.) 0.325 mm (0.0128 in.)
