2) MRE Type VVT Sensor
(cid:3) The MRE type VVT sensor consists of an MRE, a magnet and a sensor. The direction of the magnetic
field changes due to the different shapes (protruded and non-protruded portions) of the timing rotor,
which passes by the sensor. As a result, the resistance of the MRE changes, and the output voltage to
the ECM changes to Hi or Lo. The ECM detects the camshaft position based on this output voltage.
(cid:3) The differences between the MRE type VVT sensor and the pickup coil type VVT sensor used on the
conventional model are as follows.
