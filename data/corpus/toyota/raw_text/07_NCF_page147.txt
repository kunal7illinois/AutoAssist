EG-120 ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE
3) Operation
The knocking vibration is transmitted to the
steel weight and its inertia applies pressure to
the piezoelectric element. The action Steel Weight
generates electromotive force.

4) Open/Short Circuit Detection Resistor
During the ignition is ON, the open/short circuit detection resistor in the knock sensor and the resistor
in the ECM keep the voltage at the terminal KNK1 of engine constant.
An IC (Integrated Circuit) in the ECM is always monitoring the voltage of the terminal KNK1. If the
open/short circuit occurs between the knock sensor and the ECM, the voltage of the terminal KNK1 will
change and the ECM detects the open/short circuit and stores DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code).

Service Tip
These knock sensors are mounted in the specific directions and angles as illustrated. To prevent
the right and left bank connectors from being interchanged, make sure to install each sensor in
its prescribed direction.
