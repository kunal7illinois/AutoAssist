CANH (6) - BAT (16) HIGH-level CAN bus line Ignition switch OFF* 6 kΩ or higher
CANL (14) - BAT (16) LOW-level CAN bus line Ignition switch OFF* 6 kΩ or higher
NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches
or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
(b) Connect the cable of the intelligent tester (with CAN
VIM) to the DLC3, turn the ignition switch to the ON
EI position and attempt to use the intelligent tester. If
the screen displays a communication error
message, a problem exists in the vehicle side of the
tester side.
HINT:
• If communication is normal when the tool is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
on the original vehicle.
• If communication is still impossible when the tool
is connected to another vehicle, the problem is
probably in the tool itself. Consult the Service
DLC3 Department listed in the tool's instruction manual.
