ES–285
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Time after key off 5, 7 or 9.5 hours
EVAP pressure sensor malfunction (P0450, P0451, P0452 and
Not detected
P0453)
EVAP VSV Not operated by scan tool
Vent valve Not operated by scan tool
Leak detection pump Not operated by scan tool
Both of following conditions are met before key OFF: Conditions 1 and 2
1. Duration that vehicle is being driven 5 minutes or more
2. EVAP purge operation Performed
ECT 4.4 to 35°C (40 to 95°F)
IAT 4.4 to 35°C (40 to 95°F)
1. Key-off monitor sequence 1 to 8
1. Atmospheric pressure
Next sequence is run if following condition is met: - ES
Atmospheric pressure change Less than 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) for 1 second
2. First reference pressure
Next sequence is run if all of following conditions are met: Conditions 1, 2 and 3
1. EVAP pressure when 4 seconds after reference pressure
-1 kPa (-7.5 mmHg) or less
measurement
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.05 kPa (-36.38 to -7.87 mmHg)
3. Reference pressure Saturated within 1 minute
3. Vent valve stuck closed check
Next sequence is run if following condition is met: -
EVAP pressure change after vent valve is ON 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) or more
4. Vacuum introduction and leak
Next sequence is run if both of following conditions are met: -
Vacuum introduction time 15 minutes or less
5. EVAP VSV stuck closed check
Next sequence is run if following condition is met: -
EVAP pressure change after purge VSV ON 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) or more
6. Second reference pressure measurement
Next sequence is run if all of following conditions are met: Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4
1. EVAP pressure just after reference pressure measurement -1 kPa (-7.5 mmHg) or less
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.05 kPa (-36.38 to -7.87 mmHg)
3. Reference pressure Saturated within 1 minute
4. Reference pressure difference between first and second Less than 0.7 kPa (5.25 mmHg)
7. Leak check
Next sequence is run if following condition is met: -
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction was complete Less than second reference pressure
8. Atmospheric pressure
Monitor is complete -
Atmospheric pressure difference between sequence 1 and 8 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) or less
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
"Saturated" indicates that the EVAP pressure change is less than 0.1 kPa (0.75 mmHg) in 30 seconds.
P0455: EVAP gross leak
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction is complete Higher than reference pressure x 0.2
