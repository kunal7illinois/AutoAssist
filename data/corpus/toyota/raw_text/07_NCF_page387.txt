Solenoid Valve Operation
(cid:1) The crank chamber is connected to the discharge passage. A solenoid valve is provided between the
discharge passage (LO pressure) and the discharge passage (HI pressure).
(cid:1) The solenoid valve operates under duty cycle control in accordance with the signals from A/C ECU.

(cid:1) When the solenoid valve closes (solenoid coil is energized), a difference in pressure is created and the
pressure in the crank chamber decreases. Then, the pressure that is applied to the right side of the piston
becomes greater than the pressure that is applied to the left side of the piston. This compresses the spring
and tilts the swash plate. As a result, the piston stroke increases and the discharge capacity increases.
