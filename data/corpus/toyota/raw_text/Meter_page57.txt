DESCRIPTION
The meter CPU receives engine coolant temperature signals from the ECM via the CAN communication
lines (CAN No. 1 Bus). The meter CPU displays engine coolant temperature that is calculated based on
the data received from the ECM.

INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
If there is an open or short in the engine coolant temperature sensor circuit, the ECM outputs the DTCs.
Perform troubleshooting with the "SFI System" (See page ES-38 for 2AZ-FE, ES-63 for 2GR-FE).
1 CHECK CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
(a) Check if CAN communication DTC is output (See page
CA-25).
