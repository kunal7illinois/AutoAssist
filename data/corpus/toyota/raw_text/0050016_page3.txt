2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
COMPONENT OPERATING RANGE
A/F sensor heater current 0.9 to 9.9 A
WIRING DIAGRAM
Refer to DTC P2195 (see page ES-296).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred. ES
1 INSPECT AIR-FUEL RATIO SENSOR (HEATER RESISTANCE)
(a) Disconnect the B7 A/F sensor connector.
Component Side:
(b) Measure the resistance of the A/F sensor connector.
