2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
HINT:
When any of these DTCs are set, check the IAT by entering the following menus on the intelligent tester:
DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY / INTAKE AIR.
Temperature Displayed Malfunction
-40°C (-40°F) Open circuit
140°C (284°F) or higher Short circuit
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM monitors the sensor voltage and uses this value to calculate the Intake Air Temperature (IAT).
When the sensor output voltage deviates from the normal operating range, the ECM interprets this as a
malfunction in the IAT sensor and sets a DTC.
Example:
If the sensor output voltage is -40°C (-40°F) for 0.5 seconds or more, the ECM determines that there is
an open in the IAT sensor circuit, and sets DTC P0113. Conversely, if the output voltage is more than ES
140°C (284°F) for 0.5 seconds or more, the ECM determines that there is a short in the sensor circuit,
and sets DTC P0112.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 0.5 seconds after the engine is next started.
