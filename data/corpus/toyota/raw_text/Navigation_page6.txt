NAVIGATION – NAVIGATION SYSTEM
HINT:
The combination of autonomous and GPS
navigation makes it possible to display the vehicle
position even when the vehicle is in places where
the GPS radio wave cannot receive a signal. When
only autonomous navigation is used, however, the
mapping accuracy may slightly decline.
(b) Autonomous navigation
This method determines the relative vehicle position
based on the running track determined by the gyro
and vehicle speed sensors located in the radio and
navigation assembly.
(1) Gyro sensor
Calculates the direction by detecting angular
velocity. It is located in the radio and navigation
assembly.
(2) Vehicle speed sensor
Used to calculate the vehicle running distance.
