ES–88
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The sensing position of the Heated Oxygen (HO2) sensor has a zirconia element which is used to detect
the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas. If the zirconia element is at the appropriate temperature,
and the difference between the oxygen concentrations surrounding the inside and outside surfaces of the
sensor is large, the zirconia element generates voltage signals. In order to increase the oxygen
concentration detecting capacity of the zirconia element, the ECM supplements the heat from the exhaust
with heat from a heating element inside the sensor.
Heated oxygen sensor heater range check (P0037 and P0038):
The ECM monitors the current applied to the O2 sensor heater to check the heater for malfunctions. If the
current is below the threshold value, the ECM determines that there is an open circuit in the heater. If the
current is above the threshold value, the ECM determines that there is a short circuit in the heater.
The ECM constantly monitors the current applied to the heater. If the ECM detects an open or short
ES
circuit, the ECM turns the MIL on and sets a DTC.
If a malfunction is detected, the ECM cuts off the current applied to the heater.
Example:
The ECM sets DTC P0038 when the current in the HO2 sensor heater is more than 2 A. Conversely,
when the heater current is less than 0.3 A, DTC P0037 is set.
Heated oxygen sensor heater performance (P0141):
After the accumulated heater ON time exceeds 100 seconds, the ECM calculates the heater resistance
using the battery voltage and the current applied to the heater.
If the resistance is above the threshold value, the ECM determines that there is a malfunction in the HO2
sensor heater and set DTC P0141.
