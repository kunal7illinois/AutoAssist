first. Then troubleshoot the occupant
classification system if DTC B1650/32 is
detected, and troubleshoot the passenger
airbag ON/OFF indicator if DTC B1660/43 is
detected.

7. ACTIVATION PREVENTION MECHANISM
(a) FUNCTION OF ACTIVATION PREVENTION
MECHANISM
(1) An activation prevention mechanism is built into
the connector (on the center airbag sensor
assembly side) of the airbag system squib circuit
to prevent accidental airbag activation.
(2) This mechanism closes the circuit when the
connector is disconnected by bringing the short
spring into contact with the terminals and
shutting off external electricity to prevent
accidental airbag activation.
