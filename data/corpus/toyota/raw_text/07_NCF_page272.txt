CH-108 CHASSIS - BRAKE
6. Outline of VSC Function
General
The followings are two examples that can be considered as circumstances in which the tires exceed their
lateral grip limit.
The VSC function is designed to help control the vehicle behavior by controlling the motive force and the
brakes at each wheel when the vehicle is under one of the conditions indicated below.
(cid:1) When the front wheels lose grip in relation to the rear wheels (front wheel skid tendency).
(cid:1) When the rear wheels lose grip in relation to the front wheels (rear wheel skid tendency).

Method for Determining the Vehicle Condition
To determine the condition of the vehicle, sensors detect the steering angle, vehicle speed, vehicle’s yaw
rate, and the vehicle’s lateral acceleration, which are then calculated by the skid control ECU.
1) Determining Front Wheel Skid
Whether or not the vehicle is in the state of Actual Locus of Travel
front wheel skid is determined by the (Actual Yaw Rate)
difference between the target yaw rate and the
vehicle’s actual yaw rate. Locus of Travel
When the vehicle’s actual yaw rate is smaller Based on the
than the yaw rate (a target yaw rate that is Target Yaw Rate
determined by the vehicle speed and steering
angle) that should be rightfully generated
when the driver operates the steering wheel, it
means the vehicle is making a turn at a greater
angle than the locus of travel.
Thus, the skid control ECU determines that
there is a large tendency to front wheel skid.
