BO-6 BODY - BODY STRUCTURE
3. Impact Absorbing Structure for Side Collision
The impact energy of a side collision directed to the cabin area is dispersed throughout the body via the pillar
reinforcements, side impact protection beams, and floor cross members, thus helping minimize the impact
energy finally directed to the cabin.
(cid:1) In order to obtain optimal bearing force, ultra high strength sheet steel is employed in the center pillar
reinforcement as described on page BO-2, furthermore, box-shaped reinforcement is used inside the center
pillar (A - A cross section).
(cid:1) Ultra high strength sheet steel is used in the roof reinforcement. In addition, the structure has been made
to bear impact loads with both side rails (B - B cross section). This reduces the intrusion of the roof rail
into the cabin in the event of a side collision.
(cid:1) A bulk is used for the rear door inner and a gusset is used for the center floor cross member on the cabin
interior side. When a side collision occurs, loads are conducted from the bulk to the gusset, deformation
of the vehicle body is minimized (C - C cross section).
