INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• The following conditions may also cause DTC P0505 to be set:
(a)The floor carpet overlapping slightly onto the accelerator pedal, causing the accelerator pedal to be
slightly depressed and therefore the throttle valve position to be slightly open.
(b)The accelerator pedal being not fully released.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
