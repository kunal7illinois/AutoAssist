DESCRIPTION
The circuit description can be found in the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) System (See page ES-400).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
Refer to the EVAP System (See page ES-400).
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
5 hours* after the engine switch is turned off, the electric vacuum pump creates negative pressure
(vacuum) in the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) system. The ECM monitors for leaks and actuator
malfunctions based on the EVAP pressure.
HINT:
*: If the engine coolant temperature is not below 35°C (95°F) 5 hours after the engine switch is turned off,
the monitor check starts 2 hours later. If it is still not below 35°C (95°F) 7 hours after the engine switch is
turned off, the monitor check starts 2.5 hours later.
Sequence Operation Description Duration
Activated by soak timer, 5 hours (7 or 9.5 hours) after
