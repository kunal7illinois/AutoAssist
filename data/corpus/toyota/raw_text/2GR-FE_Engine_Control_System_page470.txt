2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
ACIS Control Circuit
DESCRIPTION
This circuit opens and closes the Intake Air Control Valve (IACV) in response to changes in the engine
load in order to increase the intake efficiency (ACIS: Acoustic Control Induction System).
When the engine speed is between 0 and 4,450 rpm and the throttle valve opening angle is 60° or more,
the ECM supplies current to the VSV (ON status), to close the IACV. Under other conditions, the VSV is
usually OFF and the IACV is open.
