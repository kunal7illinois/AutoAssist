HINT:
DTC P0014, P0015, P0024 or P0025 is output when
foreign objects in engine oil are caught in some parts of
the system. These codes will stay output even if the
system returns to normal after a short time. These
foreign objects are then captured by the oil, thus
eliminating the source of the problem.
