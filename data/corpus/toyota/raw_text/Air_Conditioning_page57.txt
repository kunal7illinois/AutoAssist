AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
DTC B1413/13 Evaporator Temperature Sensor Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The evaporator temperature sensor (A/C thermistor) is installed on the evaporator in the air conditioning
unit. It detects the temperature of the cooled air that has passed through the evaporator and its signal is
used to control the air conditioning. It sends a signal to the A/C amplifier. The resistance of the evaporator
temperature sensor (A/C thermistor) changes in accordance with the temperature of the cooled air that
has passed through the evaporator. As the temperature decreases, the resistance increases. As the
temperature increases, the resistance decreases.
The A/C amplifier applies voltage (5 V) to the evaporator temperature sensor (A/C thermistor) and reads
voltage changes as the resistance of the evaporator temperature sensor (A/C thermistor) changes. This
sensor is used to prevent the evaporator from freezing.
