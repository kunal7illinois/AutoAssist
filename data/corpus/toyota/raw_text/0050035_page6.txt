Following the A/F CONTROL procedure enables technicians
to check and graph the voltage outputs of both the A/F and
HO2 sensors.
To display the graph, select the following menu items on the
tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST /
A/F CONTROL / USER DATA / AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2;
then press the YES button and then the ENTER button
followed by the F4 button.
