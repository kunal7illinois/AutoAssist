AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
2. NEURAL NETWORK CONTROL
• In previous automatic air conditioning systems, the A/
C amplifier determined the required outlet air
temperature and blower air volume in accordance
with the calculation formula that has been obtained
based on information received from the sensors.
However, because the senses of a person are rather
complex, a given temperature is sensed differently,
depending on the environment in which the person is
situated. For example, a given amount of solar
radiation can feel comfortably warm in a cold climate,
or extremely uncomfortable in a hot climate.
Therefore, as a technique for effecting a higher level
of control, a neural network has been adopted in the
automatic air conditioning system. With this
technique, the data that has been collected under
varying environmental conditions is stored in the A/C
amplifier. The A/C amplifier can then effect control to
provide enhanced air conditioning comfort.
• The neural network control consists of neurons in the
input layer, intermediate layer, and output layer. The
input layer neurons process the input data of the
outside temperature, the amount of sunlight, and the
room temperature based on the outputs of the
switches and sensors, and output them to the
intermediate layer neurons. Based on this data, the
intermediate layer neurons adjust the strength of the
AC
links among the neurons. The sum of these is then
calculated by the output layer neurons in the form of
the required outlet temperature, solar correction,
target airflow volume, and outlet mode control
volume. Accordingly, the A/C amplifier controls the
servo motors and blower motor in accordance with
the control volumes that have been calculated by the
neural network control.
