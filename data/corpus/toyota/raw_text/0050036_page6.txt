DESCRIPTION
The description can be found in the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) System (see page ES-335).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
Refer to the EVAP System (see page ES-340).
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The two monitors, Key-Off and Purge Flow, are used to detect malfunctions relating to DTC P0441. The
Key-Off monitor is initiated by the ECM internal timer, known as the soak timer, 5 hours* after the ignition
switch is turned OFF. The purge flow monitor runs while the engine is running.
1. KEY-OFF MONITOR
5 hours* after the ignition switch is turned OFF, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure
(vacuum) in the EVAP system. The ECM monitors for leaks and actuator malfunctions based on the
EVAP pressure.
HINT:
*: If the engine coolant temperature is not below 35°C (95°F) 5 hours after the ignition switch is turned
OFF, the monitor check starts 2 hours later. If it is still not below 35°C (95°F) 7 hours after the ignition
switch is turned OFF, the monitor check starts 2.5 hours later.
