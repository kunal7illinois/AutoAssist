INTRODUCTION – REPAIR INSTRUCTION
(1) Use the formula below to calculate special
L1 L2
torque values for situations where SST or an
extension tool is combined with the torque
wrench.
Formula:
T' = L2/(L1 + L2) * T
IN
T' Reading of torque wrench {N*m
(kgf*cm, ft.*lbf)}
T Torque {N*m (kgf*cm, ft.*lbf)}
D001201E01 L1 Length of SST or extension tool {cm
(in.)}
L2 Length of torque wrench {cm (in.)}
NOTICE:
If an extension tool or SST is combined with
a torque wrench and the wrench is used to
tighten to a torque specification in this
manual, the actual torque will be excessive
and parts will be damaged.
2. FOR VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH SRS AIRBAG AND
SEAT BELT PRETENSIONER
The CAMRY is equipped with a Supplemental Restraint
System (SRS).
CAUTION:
Failure to carry out the service operations in the
correct sequence could cause the SRS to
unexpectedly deploy during servicing and lead to
serious injury. Furthermore, if a mistake is made
when servicing SRS, it is possible that the SRS may
fail to operate properly. Before servicing (including
removal or installation of parts, inspection or
replacement), be sure to read the following section
carefully.
(a) GENERAL NOTICE
(1) As malfunctions of the SRS are difficult to
confirm, the Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)
become the most important source of
information when troubleshooting. When
troubleshooting the SRS, always check the
DTCs before disconnecting the battery.
