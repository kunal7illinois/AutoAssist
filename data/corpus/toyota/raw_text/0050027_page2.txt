(a) Estimated ECT 75°C (167°F) or more
(b) ECT sensor output Below 75°C (167°F)
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0128)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
(c) Turn the tester ON.
