ES–333
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
*System guard set when following conditions are met: -
Throttle actuator ON
Throttle actuator duty calculation Executing
Throttle position sensor Fail determined
Throttle actuator current-cut operation Not executing
Throttle actuator power supply 4 V or more
Throttle actuator Fail determined
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
P2111 (Throttle actuator stuck open):
TP sensor voltage change No change
P2112 (Throttle actuator stuck closed):
TP sensor voltage change No change ES
FAIL-SAFE
When either of these DTCs, as well as other DTCs relating to ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System)
malfunctions, is set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe mode, the ECM cuts the current to
the throttle actuator off, and the throttle valve is returned to a 6° throttle angle by the return spring. The
ECM then adjusts the engine output by controlling the fuel injection (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition
timing, in accordance with the accelerator pedal opening angle, to allow the vehicle to continue running at
a minimal speed. If the accelerator pedal is depressed firmly and gently, the vehicle can be driven slowly.
Fail-safe mode continues until a pass condition is detected, and the ignition switch is then turned off.
WIRING DIAGRAM
Refer to DTC P2102 (See page ES-320).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data
can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine was
warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the time of
a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P2111 or P2112)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED
OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read the DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC Output) Proceed to
P2111 or P2112 A
P2111 or P2112 and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs other than P2111 or P2112 are output,
troubleshoot those DTCs first.
