SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM – SPIRAL CABLE
INSPECTION
1. INSPECT SPIRAL CABLE
(a) If there are any defects as mentioned below, replace
the spiral cable with a new one:
Scratches, cracks, dents or chips on the connector
or the spiral cable.
(b) Inspect the spiral cable.
Spiral Cable: (1) Measure the resistance according to the
value(s) in the table below.
