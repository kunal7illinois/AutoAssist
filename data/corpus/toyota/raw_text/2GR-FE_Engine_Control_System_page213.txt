DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
• Open or short in engine wire harness
• Connector connection
• Vacuum hose connections
• Ignition system
• Injector for direct injector
P0301 • Injector for port injector
P0302 • Fuel pressure
P0303 Misfiring of specific cylinder detected • Mass Air Flow (MAF) meter
P0304 (2 trip detection logic) • Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor
P0305 • Compression pressure
P0306 • Valve clearance
• Valve timing
• PCV valve and hose
• PCV hose connections
• Air induction system
• ECM
If DTCs that indicate misfires are set for different cylinders, but DTC P0300 is not set, it indicates that ES
misfires have been detected in different cylinders at different times. DTC P0300 is only set when several
misfiring cylinders are detected at the same time.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
Intake Camshaft Position Sensor
Exhaust Camshaft Position Sensor
ECM
Crankshaft Position Sensor (36-2 teeth)
A107734E02
The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets a DTC when either one of the following conditions, which could
cause emission deterioration, is detected (2 trip detection logic):
• Within the first 1,000 crankshaft revolutions of the engine starting, an excessive misfiring rate
(approximately 20 to 50 misfires per 1, 000 crankshaft revolutions) occurs once.
• After the first 1,000 crankshaft revolutions, an excessive misfiring rate (approximately 20 to 60 misfires
per 1, 000 crankshaft revolutions) occurs 4 times in sequential crankshaft revolutions.
The ECM flashes the MIL and sets a DTC when either one of the following conditions, which could cause
the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) damage, is detected (2 trip detection logic):
• In every 200 crankshaft revolutions at a high engine rpm, the threshold misfiring percentage is
recorded once.
• In every 200 crankshaft revolutions at a normal engine rpm, the threshold misfiring percentage is
recorded 3 times.
