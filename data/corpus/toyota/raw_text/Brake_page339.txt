BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
OK:
The speed value output from the speed sensor
displayed on the intelligent tester is the same as
the actual vehicle speed.
NG Go to step 5

2 PERFORM TEST MODE INSPECTION (SIGNAL CHECK)
(a) Check if test mode (signal check) DTCs are detected
(See page BC-290).

3 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL WAVEFORM
(a) Lift up the vehicle.
Skid Control ECU (Harness Side (b) Perform the inspection using an oscilloscope.
Connector Front View): (1) Disconnect the skid control ECU connector.
(2) Connect the oscilloscope to the rear speed sensor
terminals of the skid control ECU.

RL+ RR- (3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
OK:
The same waveform is output from all the 4
wheels and there is no noise or interference in
the waveform.
HINT:
RL- RR+
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
Normal Signal Waveform: and the output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to the speed sensor.
GND (4) Connect the connector.
