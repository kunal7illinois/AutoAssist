2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
A/F Sensor Circuit Slow Response (Bank 1
DTC P2A00
Sensor 1)
HINT:
Sensor 1 refers to the sensor mounted in front of the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) and located
near the engine assembly.
DESCRIPTION
Refer to DTC P2195 (see page ES-292).
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
Calculated value of air-fuel ratio (A/F) sensor response rate • Open or short in A/F sensor circuit
P2A00 deterioration level less than threshold • A/F sensor ES
(2 trip detection logic) • ECM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
After the engine is warmed up, the ECM performs air-fuel ratio feedback control to maintain the air-fuel
ratio at the stoichiometric level. In addition, active A/F control is performed for approximately 10 seconds
after the preconditions are met in order to measure the A/F sensor response rate. During active A/F
control, the ECM forcibly increases and decreases the injection volume a certain amount, based on the
stoichiometric air-fuel ratio learned during normal air-fuel ratio control, and measures the A/F sensor
response rate. The ECM receives a signal from the A/F sensor while performing active A/F control and
uses it to calculate the A/F sensor response rate deterioration level.
If the A/F sensor response rate deterioration level is less than the threshold, the ECM interprets this as a
malfunction and sets the DTC.
