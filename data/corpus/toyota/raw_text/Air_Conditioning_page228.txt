AC–224
AIR CONDITIONING – COMPRESSOR AND MAGNETIC CLUTCH (for 2GR-FE)
2. INSPECT MAGNETIC CLUTCH CLEARANCE
(a) Set the dial indicator to the magnetic clutch hub.
(b) Connect the battery positive lead to terminal 1 of the
magnetic clutch connector, and the negative lead to
the ground wire. Turn the magnetic clutch on and off
and measure the clearance.
Standard clearance:
0.26 to 0.60 mm (0.010 to 0.024 in.)
If the measured value is not within the standard
range, remove the magnetic clutch hub and adjust it
E075077
with magnetic clutch washers.
NOTICE:
Adjustment should be performed with 3 or less
magnetic clutch washers.
(c) Remove the compressor and magnetic clutch from
the vise.
3. ADJUST COMPRESSOR OIL LEVEL
(a) When replacing the compressor and magnetic
clutch with a new one, gradually discharge the inert
gas (helium) from the service valve, and drain the
following amount of oil from the new compressor
and magnetic clutch before installation.
Standard:
(Oil capacity inside the new compressor and
magnetic clutch: 130 + 15 cc (4.6 + 0.51 fl.oz.) )
- (Remaining oil amount in the removed
AC compressor and magnetic clutch) = (Oil
amount to be removed from the new
compressor when replacing)
NOTICE:
• When checking the compressor oil level,
observe the precautions on the cooler
removal/installation.
• If a new compressor and magnetic clutch is
installed without removing some oil, due to
the oil remaining in the pipes of the vehicle,
the oil amount will be too large. This prevents
heat exchange in the refrigerant cycle and
causes refrigerant failure.
• If the volume of oil remaining in the removed
compressor and magnetic clutch is too small,
check for oil leakage.
• Be sure to use ND-OIL 8 or equivalent for
compressor oil.
