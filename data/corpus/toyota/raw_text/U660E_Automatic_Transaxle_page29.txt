The TCM memorizes the condition that the ECT controls
the automatic transaxle assembly and engine assembly
according to those characteristics. Therefore, when the
automatic transaxle assembly, engine assembly, or TCM
has been replaced, it is necessary to reset the memory
so that the TCM can memorize the new information.
Reset procedure is as follows.
(a) Shift the shift lever to N or P position.
(b) Turn the ignition switch off.
(c) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) and push the
