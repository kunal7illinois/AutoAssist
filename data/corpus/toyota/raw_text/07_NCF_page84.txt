ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-57
Operation
(cid:3) The ECM fully closes the intake manifold runner valve during engine idling when the engine coolant
temperature is between -10(cid:4)C (14(cid:4)F) and 60(cid:4)C (140(cid:4)F) and the intake air temperature is more than
-10(cid:4)C (14(cid:4)F). Other than this condition, the ECM fully opens the intake manifold runner valve.
(cid:3) When the engine is stopped, the intake manifold runner valve is kept in a half-open condition to ensure
the engine startability.
