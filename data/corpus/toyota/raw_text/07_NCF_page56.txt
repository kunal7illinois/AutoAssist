Service Tip
Although the charging circuit of a conventional generator is checked through the F terminal, this
check cannot be performed on the Segment Conductor type generator through the use of the F
terminal because the F terminal has been eliminated. For details, refer to the 2007 Camry Repair
Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
2. Generator Pulley
A one-way clutch is set to the generator pulley. Operation of the one-way clutch cancels generator pulley
inertia and helps to prevent slipping of the V-ribbed belt. This realizes a low tension V-ribbed belt that
achieves reduced friction.
