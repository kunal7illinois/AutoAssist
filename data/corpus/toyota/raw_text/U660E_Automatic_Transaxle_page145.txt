cuit (Shift Solenoid Valve SL)
DESCRIPTION
The shift solenoid valve SL is turned ON or OFF by signals from the TCM to control the hydraulic pressure
acting on the lock-up relay valve, which then controls operation of the lock-up clutch.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
TCM detects a short in the shift solenoid valve SL • Short in shift solenoid valve SL circuit
P2769 circuit when the shift solenoid valve SL is operated (2 • Shift solenoid valve SL
trip detection logic). • TCM
TCM detects an open in the shift solenoid valve SL • Open in shift solenoid valve SL circuit
P2770 circuit when the shift solenoid valve SL is not operated • Shift solenoid valve SL
(2 trip detection logic). • TCM
Fail-safe function:
If the TCM detects a malfunction, it turns the shift solenoid valve SL OFF.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
Based on the signals from the throttle position sensor, the air flow meter and the crankshaft position
sensor, the TCM sends a signal to the solenoid valve SL to regulate the hydraulic pressure and provide
smoother torque converter clutch engagement. The shift solenoid valve SL responds to commands from
the TCM. The valve controls the lock-up relay valve to perform the torque-converter lock-up function. If
the TCM detects an open or short circuit for shift solenoid valve SL, it will illuminate the MIL.
