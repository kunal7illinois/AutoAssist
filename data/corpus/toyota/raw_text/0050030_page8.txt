(i) Read the CYL #1 to #4 or DTCs displayed on the tester.
Result
Misfire Count Proceed To
Most misfires occur in only 1 or 2 cylinders A
3 cylinders or more have equal misfire counts B
HINT:
• If it is difficult to reproduce misfires for each cylinder, check
the DATA LIST item called MISFIRE MARGIN. Try to find
vehicle driving conditions that lower the MISFIRE
MARGIN value. Values above 30 % are considered
normal.
• If the freeze frame data's record of the ECT is below 75°C
ES
(167°F), the misfire may be detected only when the engine
is cold.
• If the freeze frame data's record of the ENGINE RUN
TIME is below 120 seconds, the misfire may be detected
immediately after the engine is started.

5 PERFORM ACTIVE TEST USING INTELLIGENT TESTER (FUEL CUT #1 TO #4)
(a) Allow the engine to idle.
(b) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST / FUEL CUT#1 (to
#4).
(c) If a cylinder has a high misfire count, cut fuel to that
cylinder. Compare the misfire count of the cylinder
before fuel cut and after fuel cut.
Result
Misfire Count in Each Cylinder Proceed To
Misfire count of cylinder before fuel cut and after fuel cut roughly
A
same
Misfire count of cylinder before fuel cut lower than after fuel cut B
NOTICE:
This ACTIVE TEST cannot be performed while the
vehicle is being driven.
HINT:
If the misfire count of the cylinder before and after the
fuel cut are roughly the same, the cylinder is misfiring.
If the misfire count of the cylinder before the fuel cut is
lower than after the fuel cut, the cylinder misfires
sometimes.
