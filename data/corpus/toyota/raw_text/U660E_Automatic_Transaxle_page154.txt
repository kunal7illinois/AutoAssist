AX–154
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
Pressure Control Solenoid "D" Electrical (Shift
DTC P2810
Solenoid Valve SL4)
DESCRIPTION
Shifting gears from 1st through 5th is performed in combination with "ON" and "OFF" operation of the shift
AX
solenoid valves SL1, SL2, SL3 and SL4 which are controlled by the TCM. If an open or short circuit occurs
in either of the shift solenoid valve, the TCM controls the remaining normal shift solenoid valves to allow
the vehicle to be operated smoothly (Fail safe function).
DTC No. DTC Detecting Condition Trouble Area
The TCM checks for an open or short in the shift
solenoid valve SL4 circuit while driving and shifting
• Open or short in shift solenoid valve SL4 circuit
gears. (1-trip detection logic)
P2810 • Shift solenoid valve SL4
• Output signal duty equals to 100%.
• TCM
(NOTE: SL4 output signal duty is less than 100%
under normal condition.)
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The TCM commands gear shifts by turning the shift solenoid valves on or off. When there is an open or
short circuit in any shift solenoid valve circuit, the TCM detects the problem and illuminates the MIL and
stores the DTC. And the TCM performs the fail-safe function and turns the other normal shift solenoid
valves on or off (In case of an open or short circuit, the TCM stops sending current to the circuit.)
(See page AX-39).
