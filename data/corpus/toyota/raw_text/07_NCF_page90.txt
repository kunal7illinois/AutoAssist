ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE EG-63
Construction and Operation
1) Refueling Valve
The refueling valve consists of chamber A, chamber B, and the restrictor passage. A constant
atmospheric pressure is applied to chamber A.
(cid:3) During refueling, the internal pressure of the fuel tank increases. This pressure causes the refueling
valve to lift up, allowing the fuel vapors to enter the canister.
(cid:3) The restrictor passage prevents the large amount of vacuum that is created during purge operation or
system monitoring operation from entering the fuel tank, and limits the flow of the fuel vapors from
the fuel tank to the canister. If a large volume of fuel vapors enters the intake manifold, it will affect
the air-fuel ratio control of the engine. Therefore, the role of the restrictor passage is to help prevent
this from occurring.

2) Fuel Inlet (Fresh Air Inlet)
In accordance with the change of structure of the evaporative emission control system, the location of
the fresh air line inlet has been changed from the air cleaner to the near the fuel inlet. The fresh air from
the atmosphere and drain air cleaned by the canister will go in or out of the system through the passages
shown below.
