C TROUBLESHOOTING
VOLTAGE CHECK
To Ignition SW
IG Terminal
(a) Establish conditions in which voltage is present at the check
point.
Example:
Fuse [A] – Ignition SW on
[B] – Ignition SW and SW 1 on
[A] [C] – Ignition SW, SW 1 and Relay on (SW 2 off)
(b) Using a voltmeter, connect the negative lead to a good ground
point or negative battery terminal, and the positive lead to the
SW 1 Voltmeter
connector or component terminal.
[B] This check can be done with a test light instead of a voltmeter.
Relay
[C]
SW 2 Solenoid
CONTINUITY AND RESISTANCE CHECK
(a) Disconnect the battery terminal or wire so there is no voltage
between the check points.
Ohmmeter
(b) Contact the two leads of an ohmmeter to each of the check
points.
SW
If the circuit has diodes, reverse the two leads and check
again.
When contacting the negative lead to the diode positive side
and the positive lead to the negative side, there should be
Ohmmeter
continuity.
When contacting the two leads in reverse, there should be no
continuity.
Diode
Digital Type Analog Type (c) Use a volt/ohmmeter with high impedance (10 kΩ/V
minimum) for troubleshooting of the electrical circuit.
