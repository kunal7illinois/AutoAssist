(6) For the rest of the wheels, bleed the air in the
same way as stated in the above procedures.
(f) Bleed the air from the pressure reduction line

according to "Step 3: Decrease" on the intelligent
tester display.
NOTICE:
• Bleed the pressure reduction line by
following the steps displayed on the
intelligent tester.
• Make sure that the master cylinder reservoir
tank does not become empty of brake fluid.

• The operation stops automatically in 4
seconds. When performing this
procedure continuously, an interval of at
C132850
least 20 seconds is required.
• When the operation is completed, the
brake pedal slightly goes down. This is a
normal phenomenon when the solenoid
opens.
• During this procedure, the pedal seems
heavy, but completely depress it so that
the brake fluid comes out from the
bleeder plug.
• Be sure to keep the brake pedal
depressed. Never depress and release
the pedal repeatedly.
(4) Tighten the bleeder plug, then release the
brake pedal (*10).
(5) Repeat steps (*9) to (*10) until all the air in the
fluid is completely bled out.
(6) Tighten the bleeder plug completely.
Torque:8.0 N*m (82 kgf*cm, 71 in.*lbf)
(7) Repeat the above procedures for the rest of the
brakes to bleed the air from the brake line.
(g) Bleed the air from the brake line again according to
"Step 4: Increase" on the intelligent tester display.
