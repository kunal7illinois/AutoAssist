2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Engine Coolant Temperature Circuit Range /
DTC P0116
Performance Problem
DESCRIPTION
Refer to DTC P0115 (see page ES-105).
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
When either of following conditions met (2 trip detection
logic):
• When cold engine started and engine warmed up, Engine
Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor value does not • Thermostat
P0116
change. • ECT sensor
• After warmed up engine started, ECT sensor value does
ES not change when engine stopped and then next cold
engine start performed.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
Engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor cold start monitor
When a cold engine start is performed and then the engine is warmed up, if the ECT sensor value does
not change, it is determined that a malfunction has occurred. If this is detected in 2 consecutive driving
cycles, the MIL is illuminated and a DTC is set.
ECT sensor soak monitor
After a warmed up engine is started, if the ECT sensor value does not change when the engine is stopped
and then the next cold engine start is performed, it is determined that a malfunction has occurred. If this is
detected in 2 consecutive driving cycles, the MIL is illuminated and a DTC is set.
