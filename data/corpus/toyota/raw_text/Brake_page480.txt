BR–8
BRAKE – BRAKE FLUID
(e) Using SST, connect the brake lines to the master
cylinder.
SST 09023-00101, 09023-38200
SST Torque:without SST
15 N*m (155 kgf*cm, 11 ft.*lbf)
with SST
14 N*m (143 kgf*cm, 10 ft.*lbf)
for TMMK made with VSC without SST
19 N*m (194 kgf*cm, 14 ft.*lbf)
for TMMK made with VSC with SST
17 N*m (173 kgf*cm, 13 ft.*lbf)
Fulcrum Length NOTICE:
• Use a torque wrench with a fulcrum length of
300 mm (11.81 in.).
• This torque value is effective when SST is
C141971E01 parallel to a torque wrench.
3. BLEED BRAKE LINE
NOTICE:
Bleed the air from the brake line of the wheel furthest
BR from the master cylinder.
(a) Connect a vinyl tube to the bleeder plug.
(b) Depress the brake pedal several times, then loosen
the bleeder plug with the pedal depressed (*3).
C132853
(c) When fluid stops coming out, tighten the bleeder
plug, then release the brake pedal (*4).
(d) Repeat (*3) and (*4) until all the air in the fluid is
completely bled out.
(e) Tighten the bleeder plug completely.
Torque:8.0 N*m (82 kgf*cm, 71 in.*lbf)
(f) Repeat the above procedures for each wheel to
bleed the air from the brake line.
4. BLEED BRAKE ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY (w/ VSC)
C132852 NOTICE:
After bleeding the air from the brake system, if the
height or feel of the brake pedal cannot be obtained,
bleed the air from the brake actuator assembly with
the intelligent tester by following the procedures
below.
(a) Depress the brake pedal more than 20 times with
the ignition switch off.
