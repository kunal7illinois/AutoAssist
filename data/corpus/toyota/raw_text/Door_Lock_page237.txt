(3) Connect the positive (+) tester probe to the
positive (+) side of the battery (lithium battery),
and the negative (-) tester probe to the lead
respectively.
(4) Press one of the transmission switches on the
transmitter for approximately 1 second.
(5) Press the same or another transmission switch
again and check the voltage.
Voltage:
2.2 V or higher
B144375
HINT:
• If the temperature of the battery is low, the
inspection cannot be done correctly.
If the outcome of the test is less than 2.2 V,
conduct the test again after leaving the
battery in a place with a temperature of 18°C
(64°F) for more than 30 minutes.
• The automatic power-off function causes the
battery voltage to be 2.5 V or more (with no
resistance applied to the battery) when 0.8
seconds have passed after the switch is
pressed. Therefore, make sure to read the
voltage immediately after the switch is
pressed.
(6) Remove the lead.
(7) Set the battery (lithium battery) in the
transmitter.
