AX–90
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
Pressure Control Solenoid "A" Electrical (Shift
DTC P0748
Solenoid Valve SL1)
DESCRIPTION
Shifting from 1st to 6th is performed in combination with "ON" and "OFF" operation of the shift solenoid
AX
valves SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4 and SL which is controlled by the TCM. If an open or short circuit occurs in any
of the shift solenoid valves, the TCM controls the remaining normal shift solenoid valves to allow the
vehicle to be operated smoothly (See page AX-39).
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
The TCM checks for an open or short in the shift
solenoid valve SL1 circuit while driving and shifting
• Open or short in shift solenoid valve SL1 circuit
between 4th and 5th gears. (1-trip detection logic)
P0748 • Shift solenoid valve SL1
• Output signal duty equals 100%.
• TCM
(NOTE: SL1 output signal duty is less than 100%
under normal condition.)
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
This DTC indicates an open or short in the shift solenoid valve SL1 circuit. The TCM causes gear shifts to
occur by turning the shift solenoid valves on or off. When there is an open or short circuit in any shift
solenoid valve circuit, the TCM detects the problem and illuminates the MIL and stores the DTC. The TCM
also performs the fail-safe function and turns the other normal shift solenoid valves on or off. (In case of
an open or short circuit, the TCM stops sending current to the circuit.)
While driving and shifting between 4th and 5th gears, if the TCM detects an open or short in the shift
solenoid valve SL1 circuit, the TCM determines there is a malfunction (See page AX-39).
