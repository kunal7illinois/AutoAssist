SMART KEY SYSTEM
PRECAUTION
1. PRECAUTIONS WHEN USING INTELLIGENT TESTER
(a) When troubleshooting the smart key system using
the intelligent tester with the engine switch off,
connect the intelligent tester to the vehicle and
repeat turning any of the courtesy light switches on
and off until communication between the tester and
the vehicle begins (the interval between ON and
OFF should be less than 1.5 seconds).
(b) After DTCs are all cleared, check if the trouble
occurs again 6 seconds after the engine switch is
turned on (IG).
2. PRECAUTIONS FOR EACH FUNCTION
(a) Precautions for the electrical key:
The electrical key is a precision instrument. Be sure
to observe the following:
(1) Do not drop or strike the electrical key.
(2) Do not keep the electrical key in a high
temperature area for a long time.
(3) Do not use an ultrasonic washing machine to
clean the electrical key.
(4) Keep the electrical key away from magnets or
magnetized items during use.
(5) Do not attach any stickers to the electrical key.
(6) If an electrical key is lost, delete all registered
electrical key ID codes and then reregister the
remaining electrical keys.
(b) Precautions for the entry unlock function:
(1) As the sensor is built into the backside of the
outside door handle, the user must touch the
backside of the handle when performing the
unlock function.
(2) If touched with gloved hands, the response of
the door may be delayed.
(3) During the entry unlock operation, if the door
handle is pulled before the door unlocks, the
unlock function cannot be completed. Confirm
that the door has been unlocked before pulling
DL
the door handle to open the door.
