BE-8 BODY ELECTRICAL - MULTIPLEX COMMUNICATION
(cid:3)CAN
1. General
(cid:3) The ’07 Camry uses two types of CAN that have different communication speeds: HS-CAN (500 kbps)
and MS-CAN (250 kbps).
(cid:3) The HS-CAN consists of the CAN No.1 bus. The terminating resistors of the CAN No.1 bus are built into
the ECM and meter ECU.
(cid:3) The MS-CAN consists of the MS bus. The terminating resistors of the MS-bus are built into the main body
ECU and certification ECU. The MS bus is used only when the smart key system (certification ECU),
which is optional equipment, is provided.
(cid:3) The main body ECU, which has a gateway function, is used to transmit data between the CAN No.1 bus
and the MS bus.
