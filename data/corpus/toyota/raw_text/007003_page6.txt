2AZ-FE ENGINE MECHANICAL – CYLINDER HEAD
9. INSPECT VALVE LIFTER
(a) Using a micrometer, measure the lifter diameter.
Standard lifter diameter:
30.966 to 30.976 mm (1.2191 to 1.2195 in.)
If the diameter is not as specified, replace the valve
lifter.
P016860E02
10. INSPECT VALVE LIFTER OIL CLEARANCE
(a) Using a caliper gauge, measure the valve lifter bore
diameter of the cylinder head.
Standard lifter bore diameter:
31.009 to 31.025 mm (1.2208 to 1.2215 in.)
If the diameter is not as specified, replace the EM
cylinder head sub-assembly.
(b) Subtract the valve lifter diameter measurement from
the valve lifter bore diameter measurement.
Standard oil clearance:
A013374E01
0.033 to 0.059 mm (0.0013 to 0.0023 in.)
Maximum oil clearance:
0.079 mm (0.0031 in.)
If the oil clearance is greater than the maximum,
replace the valve lifter. If necessary, replace the
cylinder head sub-assembly.
11. INSPECT INNER COMPRESSION SPRING
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the free length of
the valve spring.
Standard free length:
47.43 mm (1.8673 in.)
If the length is not as specified, replace the inner
compression spring.
A051437E01
(b) Using a steel square, measure the deviation of the
Deviation inner compression spring.
Maximum deviation:
1.6 mm (0.063 in.)
Maximum angle (Reference):
2°
If the deviation is greater than the maximum,
replace the inner compression spring.
