2. P2402: Leak detection pump stuck ON
In operation B, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure (a vacuum) through the reference
orifice. The EVAP (Evaporative Emission) system pressure is then measured by the ECM, using the
canister pressure sensor, to determine the reference pressure. If the pressure is higher than -1.057
kPa-g (-7.93 mmHg-g), or lower than -4.85 kPa-g (-36.4 mmHg-g), the ECM interprets this as the leak
detection pump being stuck ON (remaining ON all the time). The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the
DTC (2 trip detection logic).

HINT:
The detection logic of DTCs P2401 and P2402 is the same because in both cases the reference
pressure measured in operation B is compared to the atmospheric pressure registered in operation A.
The ECM calculates the difference between these pressures by deducting [the reference pressure]
from [the stored atmospheric pressure], and uses this to monitor the EVAP system pressure change.
