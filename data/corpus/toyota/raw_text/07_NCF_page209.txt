CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE CH-45
(cid:3)PLANETARY GEAR UNIT
1. Construction
(cid:1) The 6-speed configuration has been achieved by using 2 planetary gear units, creating a 6-speed automatic
transaxle.
(cid:1) A Ravingneaux type planetary gear unit is used as the rear gear unit. The gear unit consists of pairs of sun
gears (front and rear) and planetary pinion gears (long and short) with different diameters within a single
planetary gear.
(cid:1) The centrifugal fluid pressure canceling mechanism is used in the C1 and C2 clutches that are applied when
shifting between the 1st to 6th gears. Refer to CH-51 for details.
(cid:1) The shapes of the grooves in the clutches and brake linings have been optimized in order to reduce drag
during clutch and brake operation.

2. Function of Components
Component Function
C1 No.1 Clutch Connects intermediate shaft and Ravigneaux planetary rear sun gear.
C2 No.2 Clutch Connects intermediate shaft and Ravigneaux planetary ring gear.
Prevents Ravigneaux planetary front sun gear and U/D planetary carrier from
B1 No.1 Brake
turning either clockwise or counterclockwise.
Prevents Ravigneaux planetary ring gear from turning either clockwise or
B2 No.2 Brake
counterclockwise.
Prevents U/D planetary ring gear from turning either clockwise or
B3 No.3 Brake
counterclockwise.
F1 No.1 One-Way Clutch Prevents Ravigneaux planetary ring gear from turning counterclockwise.
These gears change the route through which driving force is transmitted, in
Planetary Gears accordance with the operation of each clutch and brake, in order to increase
or reduce the input and output speeds.
