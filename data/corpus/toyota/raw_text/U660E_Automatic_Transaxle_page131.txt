U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
HINT:
The shift position commanded by the TCM is shown on
the DATA LIST/SHIFT display on the intelligent tester.
(h) Check the vehicle speed and the gear position when the
engine speed is 1,000 rpm.

Because the torque converter clutch has not engaged, it
may be difficult to obtain the speeds specified in 4th, 5th,
and 6th gear, however a difference of speed should still
be evident following each gear change.

(i) Compare the TCM gear shift command and the actual
gear position.
Result

HINT:
• *1: Neutral
• *2: If the shift solenoid SLT is stuck on, the line
pressure will be low. Therefore, the amount of torque
that can be transmitted by each gear is lower than the
normal limit. When the engine power exceeds this
lowered limit, the engine speed will increase freely.
• *3: When shift solenoid SLT is stuck OFF, gear
shifting is normal.
