2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(b) Start the engine and warm it up with all the accessories switched OFF, until the engine coolant
temperature stabilizes.
(c) Run the engine at an engine speed of between 2,500 rpm and 3,000 rpm for at least 3 minutes.
(d) While running the engine at 3,000 rpm and 2,000 rpm alternating at 2 second intervals, check the
waveforms of the A/F and HO2 sensors using the tester.
HINT:
• If either voltage output of the Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) or Heated Oxygen (HO2) sensor does not fluctuate,
or there is a noise in the waveform of either sensor, the sensor may be malfunctioning.
• If the voltage outputs of both the sensors remain lean or rich, the air-fuel ratio may be extremely lean or
rich. In such cases, perform the following A/F CONTROL using the intelligent tester.
• If the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) has deteriorated, the HO2 sensor (located behind the
TWC) voltage output fluctuates up and down frequently, even under normal driving conditions (active
air-fuel ratio control is not performed).

INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0420)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the tester ON.
(c) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(d) Read DTCs.
