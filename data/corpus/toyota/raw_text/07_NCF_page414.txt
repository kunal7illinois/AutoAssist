BE-80 BODY ELECTRICAL - POWER WINDOW SYSTEM
(cid:4)JAM PROTECTION FUNCTION
(cid:3) A jam protection function automatically stops the power window and moves it downward if a foreign
object gets jammed in the door window during one-touch auto up operation.
(cid:3) The operation of the jam protection function is described below.

200 mm (7.87 in.) or less
is reached or five seconds.
(cid:3) The worm gear and Hall IC in the power
window motor assembly are used to enable the Hall IC
power window jam protection.
Worm Gear
01YBE60TE
(cid:3) The Hall IC converts the changes in the magnetic flux that occur through the rotation of the worm gear
into pulse signals and outputs them to the power window ECU.
(cid:3) To control the jam protection function, the ECU determines the amount of movement and jamming of the
window glass based on the pulse signals from the Hall IC.
