DOOR LOCK – KEY REMINDER WARNING SYSTEM
(b) Connect the cable of the intelligent tester (with CAN
VIM) to the DLC3, turn the ignition switch to the ON
position and attempt to use the intelligent tester. If
the screen displays a communication error
message, a problem exists in the vehicle side or
tester side.
HINT:
• If communication is normal when the tool is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
on the original vehicle.
• If communication is still impossible when the tool
is connected to another vehicle, the problem is
probably in the tool itself. Consult the Service
DLC3
Department listed in the tool's instruction manual.
