BODY ELECTRICAL - AIR CONDITIONING BE-61
3. Self-Diagnosis
(cid:1) The A/C ECU has a self-diagnosis function. It stores any operation failures in the air conditioning system
memory in the form of DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code).
(cid:1) There are two methods for reading DTC. One is to use a hand-held tester, and the other is to read DTC
indicated on the heater control panel display (Only for models with automatic air conditioning).
(cid:1) For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
Service Tip
The A/C ECU uses the CAN protocol for diagnostic communication. Therefore, a hand-held tester
and a dedicated adapter [CAN VIM (Vehicle Interface Module)] are required for accessing diagnostic
data. For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No. RM0250U).
