AV–115
AUDIO / VISUAL – AUDIO AND VISUAL SYSTEM
Mute Signal Circuit between Radio Receiver and Stereo Component
Amplifier
DESCRIPTION
This circuit sends a signal to the stereo component amplifier to mute noise. Because of that, the noise
produced by changing the sound source ceases.
If there is an open in the circuit, noise can be heard from the speakers when changing the sound source.
If there is a short in the circuit, even though the stereo component amplifier is normal, no sound, or only
an extremely small sound, can be produced.
