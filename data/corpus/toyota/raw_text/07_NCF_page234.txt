CH-70 CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
10. Coast Downshift Control
(cid:3) The ECT ECU performs downshift control to restrain the engine speed from decreasing, and keeps fuel
cut control operating for as long as possible. In this way, the fuel economy is improved.
(cid:3) In this control, the transaxle downshifts from 6th to 5th and then 5th to 4th before fuel cut control ends
when the vehicle is decelerated in the 6th gear, so that fuel cut control continues operating.
