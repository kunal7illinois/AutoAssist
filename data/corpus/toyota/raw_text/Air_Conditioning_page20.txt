8. SERVO MOTOR
(a) The pulse pattern type servo motor consists of a
printed circuit board and servo motor. The printed
circuit board has three contact points, and transmits
to the A/C amplifier two ON-OFF signals for the
difference of the pulse phase. The BUS connector
detects the damper position and movement
direction with this signal.

9. A/C COMPRESSOR
(a) General
(1) The A/C compressor is a continuously variable
capacity type in which its capacity can be varied
in accordance with the cooling load of the air
conditioning.
(2) This compressor consists of the A/C pulley,
shaft, lug plate, swash plate, piston, shoe, crank
chamber, cylinder, and solenoid valve.
(3) The A/C pulley with built-in magnetic clutch and
the lock sensor that detects whether the
magnetic clutch is locked are installed on
models with the 2GR-FE.
(4) The DL (Damper Limiter) type A/C pulley is
installed on models with the 2AZ-FE.
(5) A solenoid valve that adjusts the suction
pressure so that the compressor capacity can be
controlled as desired is provided.
