8 CHECK WHETHER DTC OUTPUT RECURS
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the tester ON.
ES (c) Clear DTCs (see page ES-35).
(d) Start the engine and warm it up.
(e) Switch the ECM from normal mode to check mode using
the tester.
(f) Drive the vehicle for more than 10 minutes.
(g) Read output DTCs using the tester.
Standard:
No DTC output.
HINT:
DTC P0011 or P0012 is output when foreign objects in
engine oil are caught in some parts of the system. These
codes will stay registered even if the system returns to
normal after a short time. These foreign objects are then
captured by the oil filter, thus eliminating the source of
the problem.
