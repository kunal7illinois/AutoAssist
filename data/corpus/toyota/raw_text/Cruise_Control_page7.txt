CRUISE CONTROL – CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM
(e) TAP-UP CONTROL
When tapping up the cruise control main switch to +
(ACCEL)/RES (RESUME) (for approximately 0.6
seconds) while the cruise control system is in
operation, the stored vehicle speed increases each
time by approximately 1.6 km/h (1.0 mph). However,
when the difference between the driving and the
stored vehicle speed is more than 5 km/h
(approximately 3.1 mph), the stored vehicle speed
will not be changed.
(f) RESUME CONTROL
If cruise control operation was canceled with the
stop light switch or the CANCEL switch, and if
driving speed is within the limit range, pushing the
cruise control main switch to + (ACCEL)/RES
(RESUME) restores vehicle speed memorized at
the time of cancellation, and maintains constant
speed control.
(g) MANUAL CANCEL CONTROL
Performing any of the following cancels the cruise
control system while in operation (the stored vehicle
speed in the ECM is maintained).
• Depressing the brake pedal
• Depressing the clutch pedal
• The shift lever is moved from the D to the N
position or the transmission is shifted to the 3rd,
2nd, or 1st gear with the shift lever in the S
position.
• Pulling the cruise control main switch to CANCEL
• Turning the cruise control main switch off (the
stored vehicle speed in the ECM is not
maintained).
4. AUTO CANCEL (FAIL-SAFE)
This system has an automatic cancellation function (fail-
safe) (See page CC-16).
