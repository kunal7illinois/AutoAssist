DOOR LOCK – POWER DOOR LOCK CONTROL SYSTEM
Door Control Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
When the lock side of the door control switch is pressed, continuity is established between terminal 2
(driver side) or 4 (passenger side) and terminal 1 (driver side) or 3 (passenger side) of the switch. When
the unlock side of the switch is pressed, continuity is established between terminal 9 (driver side) or 2
(passenger side) and terminal 1 (driver side) or 3 (passenger side).
Terminals L1 and UL1 of the main body ECU are connected to the door control switch and door lock/
unlock request signals (by door control switch operation) are input to the ECU.
The main body ECU constantly applies voltage to terminal 2 (driver side) or 4 (passenger side) of the door
control switch via terminal L1. When the door control switch is operated to lock all doors, current flows
from terminal L1 to terminal 2 (driver side) or 4 (passenger side). The main body ECU determines that this
is door lock request signal input.
The main body ECU also applies constant voltage to terminal 9 (driver side) or 2 (passenger side) of the
door control switch via terminal UL1. When the door control switch is operated to unlock the doors, current
flows from terminal UL1 to terminal 9 (driver side) or 2 (passenger side). The main body ECU determines
that this is door unlock request signal input.
