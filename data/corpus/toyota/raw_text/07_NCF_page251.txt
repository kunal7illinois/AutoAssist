CHASSIS - SUSPENSION AND AXLE CH-87
Cornering Geometry
When a lateral force is generated, the load becomes distributed to the No.1 and No.2 suspension arms. The
illustration shown below indicates the lateral force distribution on suspension arms of the right side rear
wheel during left cornering. This causes the wheels to toe-in, in order to ensure the proper stability of the
rear suspension.
Large load distribution to No.1 arm

Braking Geometry
When the longitudinal force is generated, the displacement locus of the No.1 and No.2 suspension arms will
toe-in as shown below, in order to ensure the stability of the vehicle.
Large retraction of No.1 arm
