TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
(d) Wait for 2 or 3 minutes with the ignition switch on
DLC3:
CG (IG).
NOTICE:
• The initialization is normally completed
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 within 2 to 3 minutes.

and CG of the DLC3 connector.
(e) Confirm that the initialization has been completed
using the intelligent tester.
(1) Change the mode to test mode using intelligent
tester and check that test DTCs have been
stored.
• The test DTCs will not be indicated until the TW
system initialization is complete.
• After the initialization has been completed
successfully, the test DTCs (C2181/81 to
C2191/91) are indicated.
NOTICE:
The following operations can be used
instead of above procedure
1. Turn the ignition switch from off to on (IG).
2. Monitor the tire pressure values of all the
wheels using intelligent tester.
3. If the tire pressure values cannot be
displayed on the intelligent tester screen,
the initialization has failed.
4. It takes 2 to 3 minutes to display the tire
pressure data.
HINT:
• In winter, as the tire pressure may decrease
depending on the ambient temperature,
increase the tire pressure by 20 to 30 kPa
(0.2 to 0.3 kgf/cm2, 2.9 to 4.3 psi) above the
specified value after confirmation that the
initialization has been completed.
