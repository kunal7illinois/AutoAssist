Refer to DTC P0115 (See page ES-146).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• If any of DTCs P0115, P0116, P0117 or P0118 are set simultaneously with DTC P0125, the Engine
ES Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor may have an open or a short circuit. Troubleshoot those DTCs first.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0125)
(a) Connect an intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED
OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read the DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC Output) Proceed to
P0125 A
P0125 and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs other than P0125 are output, troubleshoot
those DTCs first.
B GO TO DTC CHART (See page ES-63)

2 INSPECT THERMOSTAT
(a) Remove the thermostat (See page CO-13).
(b) Check the valve opening temperature of the thermostat.
Standard:
80 to 84°C (176 to 183°F)
HINT:
In addition to the above check, confirm that the valve is
completely closed when the temperature is below the
standard.
(c) Reinstall the thermostat (See page CO-14).
