AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
DTC B1412/12 Ambient Temperature Sensor Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The ambient temperature sensor is installed in front of the condenser to detect the ambient temperature
which is used to control the air conditioner "AUTO" mode. This sensor is connected to the A/C amplifier
and detects fluctuations in the ambient temperature. This data is used for controlling the cabin
temperature. The sensor sends a signal to the A/C amplifier. The resistance of the ambient temperature
sensor changes in accordance with the ambient temperature. As the temperature decreases, the
resistance increases. As the temperature increases, the resistance decreases.
The A/C amplifier applies voltage (5 V) to the ambient temperature sensor and reads voltage changes as
the resistance of the ambient temperature sensor changes.
