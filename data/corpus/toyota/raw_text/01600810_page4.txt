2AZ-FE COOLING – RADIATOR
ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. CHECK RADIATOR RESERVOIR CAP SUB-
ASSEMBLY
(a) Measure the valve opening pressure.
(1) If there are water stains or foreign matter on O-
ring 1, clean it with water and finger scouring.
2 (2) Check that O-ring 1 is not deformed, cracked or
swollen.
(3) Apply engine coolant to O-ring 1 and rubber

packing 2 before using a radiator cap tester.
(4) When using the cap tester, tilt it more than 30
Reservoir Cap degrees.
(5) Pump the cap tester several times, and check

the maximum pressure*.
Pump speed:
1 pump per second
*: Even if the cap cannot maintain the
maximum pressure, it is not a defect.
Judgment criterion
Item Specified Condition
30° or more
Standard value 93.3 to 122.7 kPa (0.95 to 1.25 kgf/
(for brand-new cap) cm2, 13.5 to 17.8 psi)
Minimum standard value 78.5 kPa (0.8 kgf/cm2, 11.4 psi)
(after using cap)
A110393E01 If the maximum pressure is less than the
minimum standard value, replace the radiator
reservoir cap sub-assembly.
ON-VEHICLE CLEANING
1. INSPECT RADIATOR ASSEMBLY
(a) Check that the radiator and condenser are not
CO
blocked with leaves, dirt, or insects. Clean the hose
connections.
If the fins are blocked, wash them with water or a
steam cleaner.
NOTICE:
• If the distance between the steam cleaner and
A112201
core is too close, the fins may be damaged.
• Keep the following injection distance.
Standard injection distance
Injection Pressure Specified Condition
2,942 to 4,903 kPa 300 mm (11.81 in.)
(30 to 50 kgf/cm2, 427 to 711 psi)
4,903 to 7,845 kPa 500 mm (19.69 in.)
(50 to 80 kgf/cm2, 711 to 1,138 psi)
• If the fins are bent, straighten them with a
screwdriver or pliers.
• Never apply water directly onto the electronic
components.
(b) Dry the fins with compressed air.
