BODY ELECTRICAL - AIR CONDITIONING BE-47
Evaporator
A semi-center location air conditioning unit, in which the evaporator and heater core are placed in the
vehicle’s longitudinal direction, is used. As a result, the air conditioning unit has been made compact and
lightweight.
(cid:1) A revolutionary super-slim structure evaporator is used.
(cid:1) By placing the tanks at the top and the bottom of the evaporator unit and adopting a micropore tube
construction, the following effects have been realized:
a) The heat exchanging efficiency has been improved.
b)The temperature distribution has been made more uniform.
c) The evaporator has been made thinner. 58 mm (2.3 in.) (cid:1) 38 mm (1.5 in.)
(cid:1) The evaporator body has been coated with a type of resin that contains an antibacterial agent in order to
minimize the source of foul odor and the propagation of bacteria. The substrate below this coating
consists of a chromate-free layer to help protect the environment.

Evaporator Temp. Sensor
Evaporator temp. sensor detects the temperature of the cool air immediately past the evaporator in the form
of resistance changes, and outputs it to the A/C ECU.
Blower Motor
The blower motor has an in-built blower controller, and is controlled with the duty control from the A/C
ECU.
