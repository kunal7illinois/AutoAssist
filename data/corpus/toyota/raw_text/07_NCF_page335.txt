(cid:1)WASHER NOZZLE
Spray type washer nozzles are located under the engine hood to ensure good appearance. These nozzles can
spray windshield washer fluid over a wide area by spraying it in a fan shape. The washer fluid volume has
been reduced so as not to hinder the driver’s view when washer system is operated.

Service Tip
Spray type washer nozzles cannot be adjusted because of their structure. Do not attempt to adjust the
nozzles as it could damage them.
If adjustment is necessary, adjust the nozzles after replacing them with those selected from five part
numbers with different spray angles. For details, see the 2007 Camry Repair Manual (Pub. No.
RM0250U).
