11. CHECK CHARGING CIRCUIT WITH LOAD
(a) Keep the engine speed at 2,000 rpm, turn on the
high beam headlights, and turn the heater blower
switch to the "HI" position.
(b) Check the reading on the ammeter.
Standard amperage:
30 A or more
If the ammeter reading is less than the standard
amperage, replace the generator assembly.
HINT:
• If the battery is fully charged, the ammeter
reading may be less than the standard
amperage. In this case, increase electrical load
by operating devices such as the wiper motor
and rear window defogger. Then, recheck the
reading on the ammeter.
