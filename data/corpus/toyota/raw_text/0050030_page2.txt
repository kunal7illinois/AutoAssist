2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets a DTC when either of the following conditions, which could cause
emission deterioration, is detected (2 trip detection logic).
• Within the first 1,000 crankshaft revolutions of the engine starting, an excessive misfiring rate
(approximately 20 to 50 misfires per 1,000 crankshaft revolutions) occurs once.
• After the first 1,000 crankshaft revolutions, an excessive misfiring rate (approximately 20 to 50 misfires
per 1,000 crankshaft revolutions) occurs 4 times in sequential crankshaft revolutions.
The ECM flashes the MIL and sets a DTC when either of the following conditions, which could cause
Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) damage, is detected (2 trip detection logic).
• In every 200 crankshaft revolutions at a high engine rpm, the threshold misfiring percentage is
recorded once.
• In every 200 crankshaft revolutions at a normal engine rpm, the threshold misfiring percentage is
recorded 3 times.
