CRUISE CONTROL – CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM
Cruise Control Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The cruise control main switch operates 7 functions: SET, - (COAST), TAP-DOWN, RES (RESUME), +
(ACCEL), TAP-UP, and CANCEL. The SET, TAP-DOWN, and - (COAST) functions, and the RES
(RESUME), TAP-UP, and + (ACCEL) functions are operated with the same switch. The cruise control
main switch is an automatic return type switch which turns on only while operating it in the direction of
each arrow and turns off after releasing it. The internal contact point of the cruise control main switch is
turned on with the switch operation. Then the ECM reads the voltage value that has been changed by the
switch operation to control SET, - (COAST), RES (RESUME), + (ACCEL), and CANCEL.
