Wireless Door Lock Control without Smart Key System
System Outline
Door lock control (Lock and unlock) and panic control (Theft alarm and flash) is performed by remote control, without the
ignition key inserted in the door key cylinder, using low–power electrical waves emitted by a transmitter.
1. Wireless Door Lock or Unlock Normal Operation
With the ignition key not inserted into the ignition key cylinder (Unlock warning SW off) and all the doors completely closed,
when the lock or unlock button (Transmitter) is pushed, the door control receiver receives the electrical waves from the
transmitter, and sends a signal to the main body ECU, causing it to operate.
As a result, the main body ECU judges whether the door is locked or unlocked based on the signal from the door lock motor
and door unlock detection SW, and sends a signal to switch the condition from lock to unlock or vice versa, causing the door
lock motor to operate.
2. Visual Confirmation of Lock or Unlock
If all doors indicate that they are locked after the lock command, turn signal light will flash once. If any door indicates that it is
open after the unlock command, turn signal light will flash twice.
3. Buzzer Sound Function
If all doors indicate that they are locked after the lock command, the keyless buzzer goes on once. If any door indicates that
it is open after the unlock command, the keyless buzzer goes on twice.
4. Illuminated Entry Function
When the main body ECU detects the unlock state after the unlock operation has been made, it turns on the lights, such as
the ignition key cylinder light and interior light for approx. 15 sec. If all the doors are locked during this operation, lighting is
cancelled and the lights immediately fade out.
5. Wireless Door Unlock Operation
Pushing the unlock button (Transmitter) once, driver’s door is unlocked. Furthermore, pushing the button again within 3
seconds, the other doors are unlocked.
6. Automatic Lock Operation
With the ignition key not inserted into the ignition key cylinder (Unlock warning SW off) and all the doors completely closed,
after pushing the button (Transmitter) to unlock all the doors, if a door is not opened within 30 seconds, all the doors will be
automatically relocked.
7. Wireless Control Stop Function
If a door is open (Door courtesy SW on), a signal is input from the door courtesy SW to the main body ECU stopping
wireless door lock or unlock.
If the ignition key is in the ignition key cylinder (Unlock warning SW on), the unlock warning SW inputs a signal to the main
body ECU stopping wireless door lock or unlock.
8. Repeat Function
If the door lock or unlock condition does not change after wireless door lock or unlock operation, 2 seconds later, the main
body ECU sends current again to the door lock motor.
9. Remote Panic Operation
Panic will function when doors are locked or unlocked, open or closed. When the panic button (Transmitter) is pushed once,
theft alarm and horn sounds and turn signal light, headlights and taillight flash. Then, the panic or the unlock button
(Transmitter) is pushed once more, sounding and flashing will stop. Panic will not function when ignition key is in ignition key
cylinder.
