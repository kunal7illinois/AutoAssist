AV–8
AUDIO / VISUAL – AUDIO AND VISUAL SYSTEM
• If the audio system has a navigation system
installed, the multi-display unit acts as the
master unit. If the navigation system is not
installed, the audio head unit acts as the
master unit instead. If the radio and
navigation assembly is installed, it is the
master unit.
• The radio receiver contains a resistor that is
necessary to enable communication on the
different AVC-LAN circuits.
• The car audio system with an AVC-LAN
circuit has a diagnostic function.
• Each component has a specified number (3-
digit) called a physical address. Each function
has a number (2-digit) called a logical
address.
4. COMMUNICATION SYSTEM OUTLINE
(a) Components of the audio system communicate with
each other via the AVC-LAN.
(b) The master component of the AVC-LAN is a radio
receiver with a 60 to 80 Ω resistor. This is essential
for communication.
(c) If a short circuit or open circuit occurs in the AVC-
LAN circuit, communication is interrupted and the
audio system will stop functioning.
5. DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTION OUTLINE
(a) The audio system has a diagnostic function (the
result is indicated on the master unit).
(b) A 3-digit hexadecimal component code (physical
address) is allocated to each component on the
AVC-LAN. Using this code, the component in the
diagnostic function can be displayed.
