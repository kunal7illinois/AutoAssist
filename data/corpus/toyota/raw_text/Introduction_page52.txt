INTRODUCTION – HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT ECU CONTROLLED SYSTEMS
In the symptom simulation test, the problem
symptoms as well as the problem area or parts
must be confirmed. First, narrow down the
possible problem circuits according to the
symptoms. Then, connect the tester and carry out
the symptom simulation test, judging whether the
IN
circuit being tested is defective or normal. Also,
confirm the problem symptoms at the same time.
Refer to the problem symptoms table for each
system to narrow down the possible causes.
(a) VIBRATION METHOD: When a malfunction seems
to occur as a result of vibration.
(1) PART AND SENSOR
Apply slight vibration with a finger to the part of
Vibrate Slightly
the sensor suspected to be the cause of the
problem, and check whether the malfunction
occurs.
NOTICE:
Applying strong vibration to relays may open
relays.
(2) CONNECTORS
Slightly shake the connector vertically and
horizontally.
(3) WIRE HARNESS
Slightly shake the wire harness vertically and
horizontally.
Shake Slightly
HINT:
The connector joint and fulcrum of the vibration
are the major areas that should be checked
thoroughly.
(b) HEAT METHOD: When a malfunction seems to
Vibrate Slightly occur when the area in question is heated.
(1) Heat the component that is the possible cause of
the malfunction with a hair dryer or similar
device. Check if the malfunction occurs.
NOTICE:
B071602E03 • Do not heat to more than 60°C (140°F).
Exceeding this temperature may damage
the components.
• Do not apply heat directly to the parts in
the ECU.
(c) WATER SPRINKLING METHOD: When a
malfunction seems to occur on a rainy day or in
high-humidity.
(1) Sprinkle water onto the vehicle and check if the
malfunction occurs.
NOTICE:
• Never sprinkle water directly into the
engine compartment. Indirectly change
the temperature and humidity by spraying
water onto the front of the radiator.

• Never apply water directly onto the
electronic components.
