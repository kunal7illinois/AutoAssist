SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
1. DISC PLAYER OUTLINE
(a) A CD player uses a laser pickup to read digital
signals recorded on CDs. By converting the digital
signals to analog, music and other content can be
played.
CAUTION:
Do not look directly at the laser pickup because
the CD player uses an invisible laser beam. Be
sure to operate the player only as instructed.
NOTICE:
• Do not disassemble any part of the CD player.
• Do not apply oil to the CD player.
• Do not insert anything but a CD into the CD
player.
(b) Usable discs
(1) The CD player can only play audio CDs, CD-Rs
(CD-Recordable), and CD-RWs (CD-
ReWritable) that have any of the following
marks:
E119759
(c) Precautions for use of discs
NOTICE:
• Copy-protected CDs cannot be played.
• CD-Rs and CD-RWs may not be played
depending on the recording conditions or
characteristics of the discs, or due to
damage, dirt, or deterioration caused by
leaving the discs in the cabin for a long time.
• Unfinalized CD-Rs and CD-RWs cannot be
played.
• Keep the discs away from dirt. Be careful not
to damage the discs or leave your
fingerprints on them.
AV
• Hold discs by the outer edge and center hole
with the label side up.
• Leaving the disc exposed halfway out of the
slot for a long time after pressing the disc
eject button may cause deformation of the
disc, making the disc unusable.
• If discs have adhesive tape, stickers, CDR
labels, or any traces of such labels attached,
the discs may not be ejected or player
malfunctions may result.
