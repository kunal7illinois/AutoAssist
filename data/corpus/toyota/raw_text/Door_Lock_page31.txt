DOOR LOCK – POWER DOOR LOCK CONTROL SYSTEM
Rear Door UNLOCK Detection Switch RH Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The rear right door unlock detection switch is built into the rear right door lock assembly. The switch turns
on when the rear right door is locked and turns off when the door is unlocked.
The main body ECU is connected to the rear right door lock assembly via terminal LSWR (w/ smart key
system), LSWL (w/o smart key system), and rear right door lock/unlock state signals are input to the ECU.
The main body ECU applies voltage to the door unlock detection switch via terminal LSWR (w/ smart key
system), LSWL (w/o smart key system). When the door unlock detection switch is on (there is continuity
between the switch terminals), a lock state signal is input to the ECU. When the switch is off (there is no
continuity between the switch terminals), an unlock state signal is input.
