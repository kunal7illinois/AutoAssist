2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(b)Purge VSV stuck closed
In operation D, the canister pressure sensor measures the EVAP system pressure. The pressure
measurement for purge VSV monitor is begun when the purge VSV is turned ON (open) after the
EVAP leak check. When the measured pressure indicates an increase of 0.3 kPa-g (2.25 mmHg-g)
or more, the purge VSV is functioning normally. If the pressure does not increase, the ECM
interprets this as the purge VSV being stuck closed. The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC
(2 trip detection logic).

The purge flow monitor consists of the two step monitors. The 1st monitor is conducted every time and
the 2nd monitor is activated if necessary.
