BODY ELECTRICAL - REAR VIEW MIRROR BE-169
3. EC Mirror Cell
The gel type EC elements are placed between a layer of transparent conductive coating, and a layer of
conductive reflector surfaces, which are placed between 2 sheets of glass. The EC elements have color
coating characteristics. These characteristics are utilized to electronically vary the mirrors reflection rate
through the electro-chemical oxidation reduction reaction.

4. Reflection Rate Control
This CPU detects the surrounding light using its surrounding light detection sensor, the rear light using its
rear light detection sensor, and determines whether it is day or night based on the intensity of the surrounding
light. At the same time, the intensity of the glare from the rear is determined through the difference in intensity
between the surrounding and rear light. In accordance with the intensity of the rear light, the reflection rate
is varied steplessly.
AUTO OFF: Reflection Rate Fixed.
