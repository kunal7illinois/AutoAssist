Rear Occupant Classification Sensor LH Colli-
DTC B1787
sion Detection
DESCRIPTION
DTC B1787 is output when the occupant classification ECU receives a collision detection signal sent by
the rear occupant classification sensor LH if an accident occurs.
DTC B1787 is also output when the front seat assembly RH is subjected to a strong impact, even if an
actual accident does not occur.
However, when the occupant classification ECU outputs a collision detection signal, even if the vehicle is
not in a collision, DTC B1787 can be cleared by "zero point calibration" and "sensitivity check".
Therefore, if DTC B1787 is output, first perform "zero point calibration" and "sensitivity check".

INSPECTION PROCEDURE
1 PERFORM ZERO POINT CALIBRATION
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
RS
(c) Using the intelligent tester, perform "zero point
calibration" (See page RS-242).
OK:
"COMPLETED" is displayed.
NG Go to step 4
OK
2 PERFORM SENSITIVITY CHECK
(a) Using the intelligent tester, perform "sensitivity check"
(See page RS-242).
Standard value:
27 to 33 kg (59.52 to 72.75 lb)
NG Go to step 4
OK
3 CHECK DTC
(a) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(b) Clear the DTCs stored in the center airbag sensor
assembly (See page RS-41).
