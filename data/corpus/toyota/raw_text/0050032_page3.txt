INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• If no problem is found through this diagnostic troubleshoot procedure, troubleshoot the engine
mechanical systems.
• Check the engine speed. The engine speed can be checked by using the intelligent tester. To check,
follow the operation below:
(a)Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b)Start the engine.
(c)Turn the tester ON
(d)Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DATA LIST / PRIMARY /
ENGINE SPD.
The engine speed may be indicated as zero despite the engine revolving normally. This is caused
by a lack of NE signals from the Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor. Alternatively, the engine speed
may be indicated as lower than the actual engine speed if the CKP sensor output voltage is
insufficient.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
