ES–457
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Fuel Pump Control Circuit
DESCRIPTION
In the diagram below, when the engine is cranked, current flows from terminal ST1 (STR) of the ignition
switch (power source control ECU) to the starter relay (Marking: ST) coil and also current flows to terminal
STA of ECM (STA signal).
When the STA signal and NE signal are input to the ECM, Tr is turned ON, current flows to coil of the
circuit opening relay (Marking: C/OPN), the relay switches on, power is supplied to the fuel pump and the
fuel pump operates.
While the NE signal is generated (engine running), the ECM keeps Tr ON (circuit opening relay ON) and
the fuel pump also keeps operating.
