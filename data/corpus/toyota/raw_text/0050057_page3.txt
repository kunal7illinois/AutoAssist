1. P2401: Leak detection pump stuck OFF
In operation B, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure (a vacuum) through the reference
orifice. The EVAP system pressure is then measured by the ECM, using the canister pressure sensor,
to determine the reference pressure. If the pressure is higher than -1.057 kPa-g (-7.93 mmHg-g), or
lower than -4.85 kPa-g (-36.4 mmHg-g), the ECM interprets this as the leak detection pump being
stuck OFF (not operating). The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
