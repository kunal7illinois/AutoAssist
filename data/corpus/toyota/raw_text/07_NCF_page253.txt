Service Tip
(cid:3) To ensure the performance and reliability of the plunger type master cylinder, it must not be
disassembled. If it malfunctions, replace the entire assembly.
(cid:3) Before removing the plunger type master cylinder from the brake booster, discharge the vacuum
from the brake booster. Otherwise, the piston of the master cylinder may be left inside the brake
booster.
