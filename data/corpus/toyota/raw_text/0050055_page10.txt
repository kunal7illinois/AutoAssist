• If the output voltage of the A/F sensor remains at
approximately 3.3 V (see Malfunction Condition diagram)
under any conditions, including those above, the A/F
sensor may have an open circuit. (This will also happen if
the A/F sensor heater has an open circuit.)
• If the output voltage of the A/F sensor remains at either
approximately 3.8 V or more, or 2.8 V or less (see
Malfunction Condition diagram) under any conditions,
including those above, the A/F sensor may have a short
circuit.
• The ECM stops fuel injection (fuel cut) during engine
deceleration. This causes a lean condition and result in a
momentary increase in the A/F sensor output voltage.
• The ECM must establish a closed throttle valve position
learning value to perform fuel cut. If the battery terminal
has been reconnected, the vehicle must be driven over 16
km/h (10 mph) to allow the ECM to learn the closed throttle
valve position.
• When the vehicle is driven:
The output voltage of the A/F sensor may be below 2.8 V
during fuel enrichment. For the vehicle, this translates to a
sudden increase in speed with the accelerator pedal fully
depressed when trying to overtake another vehicle. The A/
F sensor is functioning normally.
• The A/F sensor is a current output element; therefore, the
current is converted into a voltage inside the ECM.
Measuring the voltage at the connectors of the A/F sensor
or ECM will show a constant voltage result.
