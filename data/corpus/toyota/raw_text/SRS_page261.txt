INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• If troubleshooting (wire harness inspection) is difficult to perform, remove the front passenger seat
installation bolts to see the under surface of seat cushion.
• In the above case, hold the seat so that it does not fall down. Holding the seat for a long period of time
may cause a problem, such as seat rail deformation. Hold the seat only as necessary.
