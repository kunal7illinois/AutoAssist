2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
EVAP pressure change after purge VSV ON 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) or more
6. Second reference pressure measurement
Next sequence is run if all of following conditions are met: Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4
1. EVAP pressure just after reference pressure measurement -1 kPa (-7.5 mmHg) or less
2. Reference pressure -4.85 to -1.05 kPa (-36.38 to -7.87 mmHg)
3. Reference pressure Saturated within 1 minute
4. Reference pressure difference between first and second Less than 0.7 kPa (5.25 mmHg)
7. Leak check
Next sequence is run if following condition is met: -
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction was complete Less than second reference pressure
8. Atmospheric pressure
Monitor is complete -
ES
Atmospheric pressure difference between sequence 1 and 8 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg) or less
Typical Malfunction Thresholds:
One of the following conditions is met: -
(a) EVAP VSV stuck open -
EVAP pressure when vacuum introduction is complete Higher than reference pressure x 0.2
(b) EVAP VSV stuck closed -
EVAP pressure change after EVAP canister purge valve is open Less than 0.3 kPa (2.25 mmHg)
