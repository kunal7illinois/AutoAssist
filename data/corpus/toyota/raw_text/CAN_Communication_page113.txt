NOTICE:
Do not reconnect the disconnected connectors until
this inspection is complete because there may be a
short to GND in 2 or more CAN bus wires.
Result
Symptom Proceed to
The resistance between terminals 6 (CANH) and 4 (CG), or the resistance between 14 (CANL)
and 4 (CG) is still below 200 Ω when all the specified connectors are disconnected from the
A
No. 1 CAN J/C. (There is a short to GND in the CAN main bus wires between the No. 1 CAN J/
C and No. 2 CAN J/C.)
The resistance between terminals 6 (CANH) and 4 (CG), or the resistance between 14 (CANL)
and 4 (CG) becomes normal (200 Ω or more) when a connector is disconnected from the
B
CAN J/C. (There is a short to GND in one of the areas that relate to the disconnected bus
wires.)
(c) When there is a short to GND in one or more of the bus
wires that connect to an ECU (or sensor):
