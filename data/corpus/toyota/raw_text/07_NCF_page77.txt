EG-50 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
2) Normal Throttle Control (non-linear control)
Controls the throttle to an optimal throttle valve angle that is appropriate for the driving condition such
as the amount of the accelerator pedal effort and the engine speed in order to realize excellent throttle
control and comfort in all operating ranges.

3) Idle Speed Control
The ECM controls the throttle valve in order to constantly maintain an ideal idle speed.
4) TRAC Throttle Control
As part of the TRAC system, the throttle valve is closed by a demand signal from the skid control ECU
if an excessive amount of slippage is created at a driving wheel, thus facilitating the vehicle in ensuring
excellent vehicle stability and driving force.
5) VSC Coordination Control
In order to bring the effectiveness of the VSC system control into full play, the throttle valve angle is
controlled by effecting a coordination control with the skid control ECU.
6) Cruise Control
An ECM with an integrated cruise control ECU directly actuates the throttle valve for operation of the
cruise control.
