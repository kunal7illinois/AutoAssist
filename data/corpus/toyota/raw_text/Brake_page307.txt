BC–296
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
(g) Turn the engine switch on (IG) to cancel the Test
Mode.
HINT:
• If the ignition switch is not turned on (IG) after the
SST is removed from the DLC3, the previous
Test Mode will continue.
• If the ignition switch is turned on (IG) with
terminals TS and CG shorted, the previous Test
Mode will continue.

5. ENGINE VARIANT LEARNING
• Engine variant learning is automatically performed
immediately after the Test Mode is entered.
• The ABS, VSC, BRAKE, and SLIP indicators come on
for 3 seconds after learning.
