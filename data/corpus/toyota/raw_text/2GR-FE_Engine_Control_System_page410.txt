NOTICE:
In this vehicle's EVAP system, turning ON the vent valve does not seal off the EVAP system. To
check for leaks in the EVAP system, disconnect the air inlet vent hose and apply pressure from
the atmospheric side of the canister.
While the engine is running, if a predetermined condition (closed-loop, etc.) is met, the purge VSV is
opened by the ECM and fuel vapors stored in the canister are purged into the intake manifold. The ECM
changes the duty cycle ratio of the purge VSV to control purge flow volume.
The purge flow volume is also determined by the intake manifold pressure. Atmospheric pressure is
allowed into the canister through the vent valve to ensure that the purge flow is maintained when negative
pressure (vacuum) is applied to the canister.
