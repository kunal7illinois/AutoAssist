RS–252
SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM – OCCUPANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
(b) Simulation method for DTC B1794:
Turn the ignition switch from the off to on (IG), hold it
for 10 seconds, and back to off again 50 times in a
row.
HINT:
DTC B1794 is output if the occupant classification
ECU receives the ignition switch off-on (IG)-off
signal 50 times in a row when a malfunction occurs
in the power circuit for the occupant classification
system.
3. FUNCTION OF PASSENGER AIRBAG ON/OFF
INDICATOR
(a) Initial check.
(1) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(2) The passenger airbag ON/OFF indicator ("ON"
and "OFF") comes on for approximately 4
seconds, then goes off for approximately 2
seconds.
(3) Approximately 6 seconds after the ignition
switch is turned to on (IG), the passenger airbag
ON/OFF indicator will show ON or OFF
depending on the conditions listed below.
Condition ON Indicator OFF Indicator
Vacant OFF OFF
Adult is seated. (Above 36 kg (79.37 lb)) ON OFF
Child is seated. (Less than 36 kg (79.37 lb)) OFF ON
Child restraint system is set. (*) OFF ON
Front passenger occupant classification
RS OFF ON
system failure
*: Child restraint system less than 7 kg (15.43 lb)
and passenger side buckle switch is ON, then 7
to 36 kg (15.43 to 79.37 lb) is set.
HINT:
• The passenger airbag ON/OFF indicator is
based on the timing chart below in order to
check the indicator light circuit.
• When the occupant classification system has
trouble, both the SRS warning light and the
passenger airbag ON/OFF indicator ("OFF")
come on. In this case, check the DTCs in
"AIRBAG SYSTEM" first.
