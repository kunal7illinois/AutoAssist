AUDIO / VISUAL – RADIO ANTENNA CORD
(c) Put the strips of the tape back to the positions
shown in the illustration in order to secure the
antenna cord to the roof headlining assembly.
HINT:
• If the tape is no longer sticky, use other tape,
such as packing tape, that has enough adhesion
to secure the antenna cord to the roof headlining
assembly.
• For the right front corner of the roof headlining
assembly, align the marking tape on the antenna
cord with the protrusion of the roof headlining,
and wrap tape around the antenna cord and roof
headlining assembly once or twice to securely
hold them.
• For the right rear corner of the roof headlining
assembly, align the marking tape on the antenna
cord with the rear edge of the roof headlining,
and secure the antenna cord to the roof
headlining assembly with tape.
