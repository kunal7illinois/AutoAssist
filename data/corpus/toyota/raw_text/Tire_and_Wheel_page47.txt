ID3 tire inflation pressure/
TIREPRESS3 min.: 0 kPa (0 kgf/cm2, 0 psi), max.: Actual tire inflation pressure -
637.5 kPa (6.48 kgf/cm2, 92.2 psi)
ID4 tire inflation pressure/
TIREPRESS4 min.: 0 kPa (0 kgf/cm2, 0 psi), max.: Actual tire inflation pressure -
637.5 kPa (6.48 kgf/cm2, 92.2 psi)
ID5 tire inflation pressure/
TIREPRESS5 min.: 0 kPa (0 kgf/cm2, 0 psi), max.: Actual tire inflation pressure -
637.5 kPa (6.48 kgf/cm2, 92.2 psi)
(c) Rapidly reduce the tire pressure for each wheel at least
40 kPa (0.41 kg/cm2, 5.8 psi) within 30 seconds.
(d) Check the DATA LIST.
NOTICE:
• It takes about 1 minute or more to display the
TW
updated tire pressure data.
• When no "Tire Inflation Pressure" data has
changed, reset the tire pressure to the
appropriate specified value and rotate the tire 90
to 270 degrees. Then rapidly release the tire
pressure and recheck it.
• Record the transmitter ID of which "Tire Inflation
Pressure" data corresponds to each tire.
(e) After confirming that one of "Tire Inflation Pressure" data
for one tire (ID1 to ID4 or ID5) has changed, repeat this
procedure one by one. Identify the transmitter that
corresponds to DTC.
