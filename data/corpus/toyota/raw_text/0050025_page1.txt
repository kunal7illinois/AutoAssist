Circuit Range / Performance Problem
HINT:
This DTC relates to the Throttle Position (TP) sensor.
DESCRIPTION
Refer to DTC P0120 (see page ES-114).
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
Difference between VTA1 and VTA2 voltages less than 0.8 V,
P0121 TP sensor (built into throttle body)
or more than 1.6 V for 2 seconds (1 trip detection logic)

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM uses the TP sensor to monitor the throttle valve opening angle.
This sensor transmits two signals: VTA1 and VTA2. VTA1 is used to detect the throttle opening angle and
VTA2 is used to detect malfunctions in VTA1. The ECM performs several checks to confirm the proper
operation of the TP sensor and VTA1.
For each throttle opening angle, a specific voltage difference is expected between the outputs of VTA1
and VTA2. If the output voltage difference between the two signals deviates from the normal operating
range, the ECM interprets this as a malfunction of the TP sensor. The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets
the DTC.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, the DTC is set 2 seconds after the engine is next started.
