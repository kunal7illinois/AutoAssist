2. Solenoid Valves
Solenoid Valves SL1, SL2, SL3 and SLT
(cid:3) In order to provide a hydraulic pressure that is proportion to current that flows to the solenoid coil, the
solenoid valves SL1, SL2, SL3, and SLT linearly control the line pressure and clutch and brake
engagement pressure based on the signals received from the ECM.
(cid:3) The solenoid valves SL1, SL2, SL3, and SLT have the same basic structure.
