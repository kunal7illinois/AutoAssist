DESCRIPTION
HINT:
ES • These DTCs indicate malfunctions relating to the primary circuit.
• If DTC P0351 is set, check No. 1 ignition coil with igniter circuit.
• If DTC P0352 is set, check No. 2 ignition coil with igniter circuit.
• If DTC P0353 is set, check No. 3 ignition coil with igniter circuit.
• If DTC P0354 is set, check No. 4 ignition coil with igniter circuit.
A Direct Ignition System (DIS) is used on this vehicle.
The DIS is a 1-cylinder ignition system in which each cylinder is ignited by one ignition coil and one spark
plug is connected to the end of each secondary wiring. A powerful voltage, generated in the secondary
wiring, is applied directly to each spark plug. The sparks of the spark plugs pass from the center electrode
to the ground electrodes.
The ECM determines the ignition timing and transmits the ignition (IGT) signals to each cylinder. Using the
IGT signal, the ECM turns the power transistor inside the igniter on and off. The power transistor, in turn,
switches on and off the current to the primary coil. When the current to the primary coil is cut off, a
powerful voltage is generated in the secondary coil. This voltage is applied to the spark plugs, causing
them to spark inside the cylinders. As the ECM cuts the current to the primary coil, the igniter sends back
an ignition confirmation (IGF) signal to the ECM, for each cylinder ignition.
