2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0500 Vehicle Speed Sensor "A"
DESCRIPTION
The speed sensor detects the wheel speed and sends the appropriate signals to the skid control ECU.
The skid control ECU converts these wheel speed signals into a 4-pulse signal and outputs it to the ECM
via the combination meter. The ECM determines the vehicle speed based on the frequency of these pulse
signals.

DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
• Vehicle speed sensor
• Vehicle speed sensor signal circuit
Vehicle speed signal from vehicle speed sensor is cut
P0500 • Combination meter
for 0.14 sec. or more while cruise control is in operation
• ECM
• Skid control ECU
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The ECM assumes that the vehicle is being driven when the transmission counter gear indicates more
than 300 rpm and over 30 seconds have passed since the park/neutral position switch was turned OFF. If
there is no signal from the vehicle speed sensor with these conditions satisfied, the ECM concludes that
the vehicle speed sensor is malfunctioning. The ECM will turn on the MIL and a DTC will be set.
