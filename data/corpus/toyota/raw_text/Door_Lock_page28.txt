DOOR LOCK – POWER DOOR LOCK CONTROL SYSTEM
Rear Door UNLOCK Detection Switch LH Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The rear left door unlock detection switch is built into the rear left door lock assembly. The switch turns on
when the rear left door is locked and turns off when the door is unlocked.
The main body ECU is connected to the rear left door lock assembly via terminal LSWL (w/ Smart key
system) or LSR (w/o Smart key system) and rear left door lock/unlock state signals are input to the ECU.
The main body ECU applies voltage to the door unlock detection switch via terminal LSWL (w/ Smart key
system) or LSR (w/o Smart key system). When the door unlock detection switch is on (there is continuity
between the switch terminals), a lock state signal is input to the ECU. When the switch is off (there is no
continuity between the switch terminals), an unlock state signal is input.
