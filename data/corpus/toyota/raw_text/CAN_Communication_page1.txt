1. STEERING SYSTEM HANDLING PRECAUTIONS
(a) Care must be taken when replacing parts. Incorrect
replacement could affect the performance of the
steering system and result in hazardous driving.
2. SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM HANDLING PRECAUTIONS
(a) This vehicle is equipped with an SRS
(Supplemental Restraint System) which includes
parts such as the driver airbag and front passenger
airbag. Failure to carry out service operations in the
correct sequence could cause unexpected SRS
deployment during servicing and may lead to a
serious accident. Before servicing (including
removal or installation of parts, inspection or
replacement), be sure to read the precautionary
notice for the Supplemental Restraint System (See
page RS-1).

(a) After repairing a bus wire with solder, wrap the
repaired part with vinyl tape.
NOTICE:
• The CANL bus wire and CANH bus wire must
be installed together at all times.
• When installing, make sure that they are
twisted.
• CAN bus wires are likely to be influenced by
noise if the bus wires are not twisted.

(b) Do not use bypass wiring between the connectors.
NOTICE:
Bypass Wire
The protective effect of the twisted wire harness
