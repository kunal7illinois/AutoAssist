ES–277
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
P2111 (Throttle actuator stuck open):
TP sensor voltage change No change
P2112 (Throttle actuator stuck closed):
TP sensor voltage change No change
FAIL-SAFE
When either of these DTCs, or other DTCs relating to ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System)
malfunctions, are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe mode, the ECM cuts the current to
the throttle actuator off, and the throttle valve is returned to a 6° throttle angle by the return spring. The
ECM then adjusts the engine output by controlling the fuel injection (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition
timing, in accordance with the accelerator pedal opening angle, to allow the vehicle to continue at a ES
minimal speed. If the accelerator pedal is depressed firmly and gently, the vehicle can be driven slowly.
Fail-safe mode continues until a pass condition is detected, and the ignition switch is then turned OFF.
WIRING DIAGRAM
Refer to DTC P2102 (see page ES-266).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P2111 OR P2112)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON.
(c) Turn the tester ON.
(d) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC Output) Proceed To
P2111 or P2112 A
P2111 or P2112 and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs other than P2111 or P2112 are output,
troubleshoot those DTCs first.
B GO TO DTC CHART
A
2 INSPECT THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY (VISUALLY CHECK THROTTLE VALVE)
(a) Check for contamination between the throttle valve and
the housing. If necessary, clean the throttle body. And
check that the throttle valve moves smoothly.
