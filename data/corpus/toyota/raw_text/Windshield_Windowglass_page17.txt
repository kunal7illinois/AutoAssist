a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the
DLC3, turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to
WS
use the tester. If the display indicates that a

connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
of the original vehicle.

tester is connected to another vehicle, the
problem may be in the tester itself. Consult the
Service Department listed in the tester's
instruction manual.
