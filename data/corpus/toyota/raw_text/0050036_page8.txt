ES–212
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
(a)Purge VSV stuck open
In operation C, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure (vacuum) in the EVAP system.
The EVAP system pressure is then measured by the ECM using the canister pressure sensor. If the
stabilized system pressure is higher than [second reference pressure x 0.2], the ECM interprets this
as the purge VSV (Vacuum Switching Valve) being stuck open. The ECM illuminates the MIL and
sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
