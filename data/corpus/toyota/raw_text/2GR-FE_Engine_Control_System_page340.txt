ES–340
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
FAIL-SAFE
When this DTC, as well as other DTCs relating to ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System)
malfunctions, is set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe mode, the ECM cuts the current to
the throttle actuator off, and the throttle valve is returned to a 6° throttle angle by the return spring. The
ECM then adjusts the engine output by controlling the fuel injection (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition
timing, in accordance with the accelerator pedal opening angle, to allow the vehicle to continue running at
a minimal speed. If the accelerator pedal is depressed firmly and gently, the vehicle can be driven slowly.
Fail-safe mode continues until a pass condition is detected, and the ignition switch is then turned off.

Refer to DTC P2102 (See page ES-322).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
ES
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data
can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine was
warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the time of
a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P2119)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED
OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(e) Read the DTCs.

P2119 A
P2119 and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs other than P2119 are output, troubleshoot
those DTCs first.
B GO TO DTC CHART (See page ES-63)

2 CHECK WHETHER DTC OUTPUT RECURS (DTC P2119)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(c) Turn the tester on.
(d) Clear the DTCs (See page ES-45).
(e) Allow the engine to idle for 15 seconds.
CAUTION:
Exercise extreme care and take precautions at
procedure "A" and "B" below. Failure to do so may
result in the vehicle unexpectedly rolling away.
