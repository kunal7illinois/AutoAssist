CAN COMMUNICATION – CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
(c) Terminating resistors
(1) Two resistors of 120 Ω resistance are installed in
parallel across the ends of the CAN main bus
wires. They are called terminating resistors.
These resistors allow the changes of the voltage
differential between the CAN bus wires to be
accurately judged. To allow proper function of
CAN communication, it is necessary to have
both terminating resistors installed. Since the
two resistors are installed in parallel, a
measurement of resistance between the two
CAN bus wires should produce a reading of
approximately 60 Ω.

4. DIAGNOSTIC CODE FOR CAN COMMUNICATION
SYSTEM
(a) DTCs for the CAN communication system are as
follows: U0101, U0073, U0100, U0123, U0124,
U0126, U0129, B1207, B1499, and B2326.
5. TROUBLESHOOTING REMARKS
(a) DTCs for the CAN communication system can be
checked using the intelligent tester via the CAN
VIM. The DLC3 is connected to the CAN
communication system, but no DTCs exist
regarding problems in the DLC3 or the DLC3 branch
wires. If there is trouble in the DLC3 or the DLC3
branch wires, ECUs on the CAN network cannot
output codes to the intelligent tester via the CAN
VIM.
(b) Trouble in the CAN buses (communication lines)
can be checked by measuring the resistance
between terminals of the DLC3. However, an open
circuit in a branch wire other than the DLC3 branch
wires cannot be checked from the DLC3.
NOTICE:
Do not insert the tester probes directly into the
DLC3. Be sure to use a service wires.
