System Outline
∗ ABS system
This system controls the respective brake fluid pressures acting on the disc brake cylinders of the right front wheel, left front
wheel and rear wheels when the brakes are applied in a panic stop so that the wheels do not lock. This results in improved
directional stability and steerability during panic braking.
∗ Front and rear braking force distribution system
Using the hydraulic controlling device, this system distributes the braking force to the front and rear wheel in appropriately
according to the running condition of the vehicle.
1. Input Signals
(1)Speed sensor signal
The speed of the wheels is detected and input to TERMINALS 5, 7, 10 and 19 of the skid control ECU with actuator.
(2)Stop light SW signal
A signal is input to TERMINAL 20 of the skid control ECU with actuator when the brake pedal is depressed.
2. System Operation
During sudden braking the skid control ECU with actuator has signals input from each sensor, which controls the current to
the solenoid inside the actuator and lets the hydraulic pressure acting on each wheel cylinder escape to the reservoir. The
pump inside the actuator is also operating at this time and it returns the brake fluid from the reservoir to the master cylinder,
thus preventing locking of the vehicle wheels.
If the skid control ECU with actuator judges that the hydraulic pressure acting on the wheel cylinder is insufficient, the current
on the solenoid is controlled and the hydraulic pressure is increased. Holding of the hydraulic pressure is also controlled by
the skid control ECU with actuator, by the same method as above. Pressure reduction, holding and increase are repeated to
maintain vehicle stability and to improve steerability during sudden braking.
