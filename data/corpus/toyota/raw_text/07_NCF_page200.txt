System Operation
(cid:3) The shift lock ECU uses the P detection switch to detect the shift lever position, and receives inputs from
the stop light switch and the ignition switch. Upon receiving these signals, the shift lock ECU turns ON
the key interlock solenoid and the shift lock solenoid in order to release the key interlock and shift lock.
(cid:3) A shift lock override button, which manually overrides the shift lock mechanism, is used.
