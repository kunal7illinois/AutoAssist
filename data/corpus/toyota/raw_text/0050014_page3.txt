2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
TYPICAL ENABLING CONDITIONS
P0100 - P0103 (MAF meter)
P0115 - P0118 (ECT sensor)
P0125 (Insufficient ECT for closed loop)
Monitor runs whenever following DTCs not present
P0335 (CKP sensor)
P0340 (CMP sensor)
P0351 - P0354 (Igniter)
Battery voltage 11 V or more
Engine RPM 550 to 4,000 rpm
ECT 75°C (167°F) to 100°C (212°F)
TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
ES
Advanced camshaft timing:
All of following conditions met -
Crank angle between reference position and actual intake camshaft 67°CA or more
angle
Valve timing No change at advanced valve timing
Retard camshaft timing:
All of following conditions met -
Crank angle between reference point and actual intake camshaft Less than 67°CA
angle
Valve timing No change at retarded valve timing
If the difference between the target and actual camshaft timings is greater than the specified value, the
ECM operates the VVT actuator.
Then, the ECM monitors the camshaft timing change for 5 seconds.
WIRING DIAGRAM
Refer to DTC P0010 (see page ES-64).
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
NOTICE:
DTC P0011 or P0012 may be set when foreign objects in the engine oil are caught in some parts of
the system. The DTC will remain set even if the system returns to normal after a short time.
Foreign objects are filtered out by the oil filter.
HINT:
If DTC P0011 or P0012 is present, check the VVT (Variable Valve Timing) system.
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine condition when
malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the vehicle was
moving or stationary, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, and other
data from the time the malfunction occurred.
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0011 OR P0012)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch ON and turn the tester ON.
(c) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(d) Read DTCs.
