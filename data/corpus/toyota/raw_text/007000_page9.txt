2AZ-FE ENGINE MECHANICAL – TIMING CHAIN
2. INSPECT CHAIN SUB-ASSEMBLY
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the length of the 16
links with the chain fully stretched.
122.6 mm
Maximum chain elongation:
122.6 mm (4.827 in.)
If the chain elongation is greater than the maximum,
replace the chain sub-assembly.
HINT:
16 Links
Take the measurements at 3 or more places
selected at random.

3. INSPECT NO. 2 CHAIN SUB-ASSEMBLY
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the length of the 8
52.4 mm
links with the chain fully stretched.
Maximum chain elongation:
52.4 mm (2.063 in.)
EM If the chain elongation is greater than the maximum,
replace the No. 2 chain sub-assembly.
HINT:
Take the measurements at 3 or more places
8 Links
selected at random.

4. INSPECT CHAIN TENSIONER SLIPPER
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the tensioner
slipper wear.
Maximum wear:
1.0 mm (0.039 in.)
If the wear is greater than the maximum, replace the
chain tensioner slipper.

5. INSPECT NO. 1 CHAIN VIBRATION DAMPER
(a) Using a vernier caliper, measure the vibration
damper wear.
Maximum wear:
1.0 mm (0.039 in.)
If the wear is greater than the maximum, replace the
No. 1 chain vibration damper.

6. INSPECT CRANKSHAFT TIMING SPROCKET
(a) Wrap the chain around the timing sprocket.
(b) Using a vernier caliper, measure the timing gear
diameter with the chain.
Minimum gear diameter (with chain):
51.6 mm (2.031 in.)
NOTICE:
The vernier caliper must be in contact with the
chain rollers when measuring.
