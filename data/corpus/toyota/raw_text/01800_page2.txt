2AZ-FE LUBRICATION – OIL PUMP
INSPECTION
1. INSPECT OIL JET
(a) Check the oil jet for damage or clogging.
If necessary, repair the cylinder block.

2. INSPECT OIL PUMP RELIEF VALVE
(a) Check the relief valve.
(1) Coat the valve with engine oil, and then check
that the valve falls smoothly into the valve hole
by its own weight.
If it does not, replace the relief valve. If
necessary, replace the oil pump assembly.

3. INSPECT OIL PUMP ROTOR
(a) Check the side clearance.
(1) Using a feeler gauge and precision
straightedge, measure the clearance between
the rotors and precision straightedge.
Standard clearance:
0.030 to 0.085 mm (0.0012 to 0.0033 in.)
Maximum clearance:
0.16 mm (0.0063 in.)
If the side clearance is greater than the
B011420E02
maximum, replace the oil pump assembly.
(b) Check the tip clearance.
Feeler Gauge (1) Using a feeler gauge, measure the clearance
between the drive and driven rotor tips. LU
Standard clearance:
0.080 to 0.160 mm (0.0031 to 0.0063 in.)
Maximum clearance:
0.35 mm (0.0138 in.)
If the tip clearance is greater than the
maximum, replace the oil pump assembly.
A114223E01
(c) Check the body clearance.
(1) Using a feeler gauge, measure the clearance
between the driven rotor and pump body.
Standard clearance:
0.100 to 0.170 mm (0.0039 to 0.0067 in.)
Maximum clearance:
0.325 mm (0.01128 in.)
If the body clearance is greater than the
maximum, replace the oil pump assembly.
