CH-148 CHASSIS - STEERING
At Low Pump Speed Range (A)
The flow rate increases proportionally to pump
speed. Rod
01YCH112Y
At Middle Pump Speed Range without Steering (B)
The flow control valve moves to the left , the Orifice
flow rate is decreased due to reducing of orifice Moving
area, which related to the rod shaft diameter at
each certain position.
01YCH113Y
At High Pump Speed Range without Steering (C)
The flow control valve moves further to the left,
flow rate is further reduced by maximum rod Moving Flow volume further reduced
shaft diameter.

During Pressure Loading (D (cid:1) D’)
When operating the steering in the middle or
high pump speed range, the pressure inside the Moving Flow volume returned
vane pump is increased pushing the flow control
to moves back to the right which is result in
increasing of the flow rate.
