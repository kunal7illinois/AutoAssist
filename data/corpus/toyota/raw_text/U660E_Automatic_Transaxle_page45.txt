U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
FAIL-SAFE CHART
1. Fail-safe
This function minimizes the loss of operation when any
abnormality occurs in a sensor or solenoid.
Fail-safe Control List

Malfunction Part Function
Input Turbine Speed Sensor Shifting to only either the 1st or 3rd gears is allowed.
• The counter gear speed is determined based on the signals from the skid control ECU (speed
Counter Gear Speed Sensor sensor signals).
• Shifting between 1st to 4th gears is allowed.
ATF Temp. Sensor Shifting between 1st to 4th gears is allowed.
ECT ECU When the vehicle is being driven in 6th gear, the transaxle is fixed in 6th gear. When being driven in
Power Supply (Voltage is Low) any of the 1st to 5th gears, the transaxle is fixed in 5th gear.
CAN communication Shifting to only either 1st or 3rd gears is allowed.
Knock Sensor Shifting between 1st to 4th gears is allowed.
The current to the failed solenoid valve is cut off and operating the other solenoid valves with
Solenoid Valve SL1, SL2, SL3 and SL4 normal operation performs shift control. (Shift controls in fail-safe mode are described in the table
on the next page. For details, refer to Fail-Safe Control Chart)
