EG-128 ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE
Operation
1) When the Intake Air Control Valve Closes
While the engine is running at middle speed under high load, the ECM controls the actuator to close the
control valve. As a result, the effective length of the intake manifold is lengthened and the intake air
efficiency, in the medium speed range, is improved due to the dynamic effect of the intake air, thereby
increasing power output.

2) When the Intake Air Control Valve Open
Under any condition except when the engine is running at middle speed under high load, the ECM
controls the actuator to open the control valve. When the control valve is open, the effective length of
the intake air chamber is shortened and peak intake efficiency is shifted to the low-to-high engine speed
range, thus providing greater output at low-to-high engine speeds.
