DOOR LOCK – POWER DOOR LOCK CONTROL SYSTEM
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM
1. DESCRIPTION
(a) Power door lock control system data and Diagnostic
Trouble Codes (DTCs) can be read through the
Data Link Connector 3 (DLC3) of the vehicle. When
the system seems to be malfunctioning, use the
intelligent tester to check for malfunctions and
perform repairs.
2. CHECK DLC3
HINT:
CG SG CANH SIL
The vehicle uses the ISO 15765-4 communication
protocol. The terminal arrangement of the DLC3
complies with SAE J1962 and matches the ISO 15765-4
format.

Symbols (Terminal No.) Terminal Description Condition Specified Condition
CG (4) - Body ground Chassis ground Always Below 1 Ω
SG (5) - Body ground Signal ground Always Below 1 Ω
SIL (7) - SG (5) Bus "+" line During transmission Pulse generation
BAT (16) - Body ground Battery positive Always 10 to 14 V
CANH (6) - CANL (14) CAN bus line Ignition Switch OFF* 54 to 69 Ω
CANH (6) - CG (4) HIGH-level CAN bus line Ignition Switch OFF* 200 Ω or more
CANL (14) - CG (4) LOW-level CAN bus line Ignition Switch OFF* 200 Ω or more
CANH (6) - BAT (16) HIGH-level CAN bus line Ignition Switch OFF* 6 kΩ or more
CANL (14) - BAT (16) LOW-level CAN bus line Ignition Switch OFF* 6 kΩ or more
NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the vehicle
as is for at least 1 minute and do not operate the
ignition switch, any other switches or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have a
malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
Connect the cable of the intelligent tester to the DLC3,
turn the ignition switch on (IG) and attempt to use the
DL
tester. If the display indicates that a communication error
has occurred, there is a problem either with the vehicle
or with the tester.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3 of the
original vehicle.
• If communication is still not possible when the tester
is connected to another vehicle, the problem may be
in the tester itself. Consult the Service Department
listed in the tester's instruction manual.
