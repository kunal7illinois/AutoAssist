SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM – AIRBAG SYSTEM
3. DEPLOYMENT CONDITION
When the vehicle collides and the shock is greater than
the specified value, the SRS is activated automatically.
The center airbag sensor assembly includes the safing
sensor and deceleration sensor. The safing sensor is
designed to turn on at a smaller deceleration rate than
the deceleration sensor.
(a) The center airbag sensor assembly determines
whether ignition is necessary based on signals from
the deceleration sensor and the front airbag sensor
(*1). If the safing sensor turns on simultaneously,
current flows to the squibs to deploy the SRS as
shown in the illustration below.

be output with the deceleration sensor ON signal
even without a signal from the front airbag sensor.
