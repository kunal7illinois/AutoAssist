2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
1. P2419: Vent valve stuck closed
In operation B, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure (a vacuum) through the reference
orifice. The EVAP system pressure is then measured by the ECM, using the canister pressure sensor,
to determine the reference pressure. If the pressure exceeds -1.057 kPa-g (-7.93 mmHg-g) 4 seconds
after the leak detection pump is turned ON, the ECM interprets this as the vent valve being stuck
closed.
The ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
