HINT:
• Sensor 2 refers to the sensor mounted behind the Three-Way Catalytic Converter (TWC) and located
far from the engine assembly.
• When any of these DTCs are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. The ECM turns off the Heated
Oxygen (HO2) Sensor heater in fail-safe mode. Fail-safe mode continues until the engine switch is
turned off.
• The ECM provides a pulse width modulated control circuit to adjust the current through the heater. The
HO2 sensor heater circuit uses a relay on the B+ side of the circuit.
