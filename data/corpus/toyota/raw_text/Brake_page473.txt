NOTICE:
• Care must be taken to replace each part properly as it
could affect the performance of the brake system and
result in a driving hazard. Replace the parts with those
having the same part number or equivalent.
• It is very important to keep parts and the area clean
when repairing the brake system.
• If the vehicle is equipped with a mobile
communication system, refer to the precaution in the
INTRODUCTION section.
• Care must be taken when using magnets as it could
affect the performance of the speed sensors.
• Since the brake line is classified as one of the critical
safety related parts, be sure to disassemble the
BR
components if a brake fluid leak is found. If any
abnormality is found, replace the component with a
new one.
• When removing brake components, cover the brake
tube connections to prevent foreign matter such as
dust or dirt from entering the tubes.
• Do not damage or deform the brake tubes when
removing or installing them.
• When installing a grommet to the body, ensure that
the brake tube passes through the center of the
grommet.
• When installing a brake tube or flexible hose, ensure
that they are free from twisting or bending.
• If the cap of the flexible hose does not match the
groove on the bracket, twist the hose slightly to insert
it.
• Flexible hoses must be free from absorber oil, grease,
etc.
• When installing a brake tube to a plastic clamp, ensure
that the brake tube is not loose or being pinched.
• Do not reuse a clip or plastic clamp removed from a
flexible hose.
• After installing a brake tube and flexible hose, ensure
that they do not interfere with any other components.
• Do not allow brake fluid to adhere to any painted
surface such as the vehicle body. If brake fluid leaks
onto any painted surface, immediately wash it off.
