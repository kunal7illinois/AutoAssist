THEFT DETERRENT – THEFT DETERRENT SYSTEM (w/ Smart Key System)
Security Indicator Light Circuit
DESCRIPTION
Even when the theft deterrent system is in the disarmed state, the security indicator blinks due to a signal
output from the immobiliser system. The security indicator blinks continuously due to a continuous signal
received from the immobiliser system while in the armed state.
The certification ECU causes the security indicator to light up or blink only during the arming preparation
state and alarm sounding states.
