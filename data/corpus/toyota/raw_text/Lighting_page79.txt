LIGHTING – HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY
• If the alignment distance is 7.62 m (25 ft):
The cutoff line should be within 101.6 mm (4 in.)
above or below the H line as well as 101.6 mm (4
in.) left or right of the V line with low-beam (SAE
J599).
• If the alignment distance is 3 m (9.84 ft):
The low beam cutoff line should be within 40 mm
(1.57 in.) above or below the H line as well as 40
mm (1.57 in.) left or right of the V line (SAE
J599).
• If the alignment distance is 7.62 m (25 ft):
The high beam center of intensity should be
within 101.6 mm (4 in.) above or below the H line
as well as 101.6 mm (4 in.) left or right of the V
line (SAE J599).
• If the alignment distance is 3 m (9.84 ft):
The high beam center of intensity should be
within 40 mm (1.57 in.) above or below the H line
as well as 40 mm (1.57 in.) left or right of the V
line (SAE J599).
• If the alignment distance is 7.62 m (25 ft):
The low beam cutoff line should be 53 mm (2.08
in.) below the H line (preferred cutoff line target).
• If the alignment distance is 3 m (9.84 ft):
The low beam cutoff line should be 21 mm (0.82
in.) below the H line (preferred cutoff line target).
5. HEADLIGHT AIMING ADJUSTMENT
(a) Adjust the aim vertically:
Adjust the headlight aim into the specified range by
turning aiming screw with a screwdriver.
NOTICE:
The final turn of the aiming screw should be
made in the clockwise direction. If the screw is
tightened excessively, loosen it and then
retighten it, so that the final turn of the screw is
in the clockwise direction.

• The low-beam light and the high-beam light are a
Aiming Screw
unit. Adjusting the aim on the low-beam to the
correct position should also result in the high-
beam adjustment being correct.
E128230E01 • If it is not possible to correctly adjust headlight
aim, check bulb, headlight unit, and headlight
unit reflector installation.
• The headlight aim moves up when turning the
aiming screw clockwise, and moves down when
turning the aiming screw counterclockwise.
