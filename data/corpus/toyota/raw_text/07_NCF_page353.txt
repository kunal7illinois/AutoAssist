BODY ELECTRICAL - LIGHTING BE-19
(cid:4)DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHT SYSTEM
(cid:3) A daytime running light system is designed to automatically illuminate the headlights (dimmed Hi beam),
during the daytime to keep the car highly visible to other vehicles.
(cid:3) The main body ECU and power distributor control this system. The main body ECU transmits a turn ON
signal to the power distributor, and the power distributor illuminates and dims the Hi beam with the duty
control.
(cid:3) This system is enabled when the conditions given below are met:
- Power Source: IG-ON*1
- Engine Speed Signal Input (Engine Running Condition)
- Light Control Switch OFF*2, TAIL, or AUTO position (if headlight-on control is not being performed
by the automatic light control.)
- Parking Brake Switch: OFF
*1: The power source condition can be changed by operating the engine switch on models with the smart
key system, and the ignition switch on models without the smart key system.
*2: Only for Canadian package models
