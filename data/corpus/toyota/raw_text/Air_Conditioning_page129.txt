AC–125
AIR CONDITIONING – REFRIGERANT
REPLACEMENT
1. RECOVER REFRIGERANT FROM REFRIGERATION
SYSTEM
(a) Start up the engine.
(b) Turn the A/C switch on.
(c) Operate the cooler compressor at an engine speed
of approximately 1,000 rpm for 5 to 6 minutes to
circulate the refrigerant. This causes most of the
compressor oil from the various components of the
A/C system to collect in the A/C compressor.
(d) Stop the engine.
(e) Recover the refrigerant from the A/C system using a
refrigerant recovery unit.
2. CHARGE WITH REFRIGERANT
(a) Perform vacuum purging using a vacuum pump.
(b) Charge with refrigerant HFC-134a (R134a).

NOTICE:
• Do not turn the A/C on before charging with
refrigerant. Doing so will cause the cooler
compressor to work without refrigerant,
resulting in overheating of the cooler
compressor.
