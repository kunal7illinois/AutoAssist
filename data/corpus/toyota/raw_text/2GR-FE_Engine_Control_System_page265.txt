The leak detection pump creates negative pressure through the reference orifice. When the system is
normal, the EVAP pressure is in 724 to 752 mmHg* and saturated within a minute.
If not, the ECM interprets this as a malfunction. The ECM will illuminate the MIL and set DTC if this
malfunction is detected in consecutive drive cycle.
