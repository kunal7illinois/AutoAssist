PRECAUTION
1. REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION OF THE TIRE
PRESSURE WARNING VALVE SUB-ASSEMBLY
(a) When installing a tire, make sure that the tire
pressure warning valve sub-assembly does not
interfere with the tire bead in order to prevent
damage to the tire pressure warning valve sub-
assembly.
(b) After completing the operation, remove the valve
core to rapidly release the air in the tire and check
that the warning light comes on. If the warning light
does not come on, the system may be defective.
(c) If there is air leakage, tighten the nut to a torque of
4.0 N*m (41 kgf*cm, 35 in.*lbf) and push the valve TW
core 2 or 3 times to remove any dirt attached to the
valve core. If air continues to leak, replace the
grommet, washer, and nut.
(d) When installing the tire pressure warning valve sub-
assembly, check whether the rim, grommet, washer,
and nut are clean. Use a manufacturer-specified
cap.
(e) When putting air into the tire, first install the tire
pressure valve straight onto the stem of the tire
pressure warning valve sub-assembly.
2. TIRE AND WHEEL REPLACEMENT
(a) If replacing a tire, be sure to check the grommet of
the tire valve for damage. If the grommet is
damaged, replace the grommet, washer, and the
nut.
(b) If tires and wheels are replaced, register the
transmitter ID (see page TW-15).
