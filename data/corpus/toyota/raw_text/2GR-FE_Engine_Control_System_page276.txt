2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
1. DTC P0450: Pressure sensor voltage abnormal fluctuation
If the pressure sensor output voltage rapidly fluctuates between less than 0.45 V and more than 4.9 V,
the ECM interprets this as an open or short circuit malfunction in the pressure sensor or its circuit, and
stops the EVAP (Evaporative Emission) system monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets
the DTC (1 trip detection logic).

2. DTC P0451: Pressure sensor noising or stuck
If the pressure sensor output voltage fluctuates rapidly for 10 seconds, the ECM stops the EVAP
system monitor. The ECM interprets this as noise from the pressure sensor, and stops the EVAP
system monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
Alternatively, if the sensor output voltage does not change for 10 seconds, the ECM interprets this as
the sensor being stuck, and stops the monitor. The ECM then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC.
(Both the malfunctions are detected by 2 trip detection logic).
3. DTC P0452: Pressure sensor voltage low
If the pressure sensor output voltage is below 0.45 V, the ECM interprets this as an open or short circuit
malfunction in the pressure sensor or its circuit, and stops the EVAP system monitor. The ECM then
illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (1 trip detection logic).
4. DTC P0453: Pressure sensor voltage high
If the pressure sensor voltage output is 4.9 V or more, the ECM interprets this as an open or short
circuit malfunction in the pressure sensor or its circuit, and stops the EVAP system monitor. The ECM
then illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (1 trip detection logic).
