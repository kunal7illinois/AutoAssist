BC–101
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
4. DTC PRECAUTION
(a) Warnings for some DTCs cannot be cleared only by
repairing the malfunctioning parts. If the warning is
displayed after repair work, the DTC should be
cleared after turning the ignition switch off.
NOTICE:
If a DTC for a malfunctioning part reappears
after it was cleared, then it has been stored
again.
5. CHASSIS DYNAMOMETER PRECAUTION
(a) Enter Test Mode to disable TRAC and VSC control
when using a chassis dynamometer.
HINT:
The vehicle may move unexpectedly out of the
dynamometer because of TRAC and VSC
operations.
NOTICE:
• Make sure that the VSC warning light is
BC
blinking (for vehicles without the multi
information display) or "CHECK VSC
SYSTEM" is displayed on the multi
information display (for vehicles with the
multi information display) (Test Mode is
achieved).
• Secure the vehicle with the lock chain for
safety.
6. CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM PRECAUTIONS
(a) The CAN communication system is used for the
data communication between the skid control ECU,
the steering angle sensor, the yaw rate sensor
(acceleration sensor included) and other ECUs. If
there is trouble in the CAN communication line,
corresponding DTCs in the communication line are
output.
(b) If the DTC in the CAN communication line is output,
repair the malfunction in the communication line and
troubleshoot the VSC system while data
communication is normal.
(c) In order to enable CAN communication, a specific
type of wiring is used for the CAN communication
lines. The wiring used for each communication line
is a twisted pair of wires that have an equal length.
A bypass wire should not be used, because the data
being transmitted will be corrupted.
