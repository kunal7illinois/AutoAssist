2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
FAIL-SAFE CHART
If any of the following DTCs are set, the ECM enters fail-safe
mode to allow the vehicle to be driven temporarily.
Fail-Safe Deactivation
DTCs Components Fail-Safe Operations
Conditions
Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) Sensor
P0031 and P0032 ECM turns off A/F sensor heater. Ignition switch OFF

Heated Oxygen (HO2) Sensor
P0037 and P0038 ECM turns off HO2 sensor heater. Ignition switch OFF

ECM calculates ignition timing
P0100, P0102 and P0103 Mass Air Flow (MAF) Meter according to engine speed and Pass condition detected
throttle valve position.
Intake Air Temperature (IAT) ECM estimates IAT to be 20°C
ES P0110, P0112 and P0113 Pass condition detected
Sensor (68°F).
Engine Coolant Temperature ECM estimates ECT to be 80°C
P0115, P0117 and P0118 Pass condition detected
(ECT) Sensor (176°F).
ECM cuts off throttle actuator
current and throttle valve returned
to 6° throttle position by return

P0220, P0222, P0223, P0604, ECM then adjusts engine output
Electronic Throttle Control Pass condition detected and then
P0606, P0607, P0657, P2102, by controlling fuel injection
System (ETCS) ignition switch turned OFF
P2103, P2111, P2112, P2118, (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition
P2119 and P2135 timing in accordance with
accelerator pedal opening angle
to allow vehicle to continue at
minimal speed*.
ECM sets ignition timing to
P0327 and P0328 Knock Sensor Ignition switch OFF
maximum retard.
P0351 to P0354 Igniter ECM cuts fuel. Pass condition detected
P1550, P1551, P1552 and P1602 Generator Alternator command is fixed. Pass condition detected
APP sensor has 2 sensor circuits:
Main and Sub.
If either circuit malfunctions, ECM
controls engine using other
P2120, P2121, P2122, P2123, Accelerator Pedal Position (APP) Pass condition detected and then
circuit.
P2125, P2127, P2128 and P2138 Sensor ignition switch turned OFF
If both circuits malfunction, ECM
regards accelerator pedal as
being released. As result, throttle
valve closed and engine idles.
HINT:
*: The vehicle can be driven slowly when the accelerator
pedal is depressed firmly and slowly. If the accelerator pedal
is depressed quickly, the vehicle may speed up and slow
down erratically.
