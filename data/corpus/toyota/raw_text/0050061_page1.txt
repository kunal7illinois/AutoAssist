ES–373
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
ECM Power Source Circuit
DESCRIPTION
When the ignition switch is turned ON, the battery voltage is applied to the IGSW of the ECM. The output
signal from the MREL terminal of the ECM causes a current to flow to the coil, closing the contacts of the
integration relay (EFI MAIN relay) and supplying power to either terminal +B or +B2 of the ECM.
