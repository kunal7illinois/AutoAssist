WINDSHIELD / WINDOWGLASS – WINDOW DEFOGGER SYSTEM
Rear Window Defogger System does not Operate
DESCRIPTION
When the rear window defogger switch, which is built into the heater control assembly, is operated, the
operation signals are transmitted to the A/C amplifier assembly through LIN. When the A/C amplifier
WS
assembly receives the signals, it turns on the DEFOG relay to operate the rear window defogger.
