CRUISE CONTROL – CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM
Clutch Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
Clutch switch circuit inspection is necessary for M/T vehicles.
When the clutch pedal is released, the ECM receives positive (+) battery voltage through the ECU IG
fuse. While depressing the clutch pedal, the clutch switch sends a signal to terminal D of the ECM. The
ECM cancels cruise control drive when terminal D receives the signal.
