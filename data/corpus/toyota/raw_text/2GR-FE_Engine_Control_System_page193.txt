12 CHECK WHETHER DTC OUTPUT RECURS (DTC P0136 or P0156)
(a) On the intelligent tester, enter the following menus:
DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II / DTC INFO /
CURRENT CODES.
(b) Read the DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC Output) Proceed to ES
P0136 or P0156 A
No output B

13 PERFORM ACTIVE TEST BY INTELLIGENT TESTER (INJECTION VOLUME)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine and turn the tester on.
(c) Warm up the engine.
(d) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED
OBD II /ACTIVE TEST / INJ VOL.
(e) Change the fuel injection volume using the tester, while
monitoring the output voltage of Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) and
HO2 sensor displayed on the tester.
HINT:
• Change the fuel injection volume within the range of -12 %
and +12 %. The injection volume can be changed in 1 %
graduations within the range.
• The A/F sensor is displayed as AFS B1S1 or AFS B2S1,
and the HO2 sensor is displayed as O2S B1S2 or O2S
B2S2, on the intelligent tester.
Result
Tester Display (Sensor) Voltage Variation Proceed to
AFS B1S1 (A/F)
Alternates between more and less than 3.3 V OK
AFS B2S1 (A/F)
AFS B1S1 (A/F)
Remains more than 3.3 V NG
AFS B2S1 (A/F)
AFS B1S1 (A/F)
Remains less than 3.3 V NG
AFS B2S1 (A/F)
HINT:
A normal HO2 sensor voltage (O2S B1S2 or O2S B2S2)
reacts in accordance with increases and decreases in fuel
injection volumes. When the A/F sensor voltage remains
either less or more than 3.3 V despite the HO2 sensor
indicating a normal reaction, the A/F sensor is malfunctioning.
