CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-117
Brake Assist Operation
(cid:3) In the event of emergency braking, the skid control ECU detects the driver’s intention based on the speed
of the pressure increase in the master cylinder determined by the pressure sensor signal. If the ECU judges
the need for the additional brake assist, the fluid pressure is generated by the pump in the actuator and
directed to the wheel cylinder to apply a greater fluid pressure than the master cylinder.
Also in the following cases, the skid control ECU provides brake assist.
(cid:3) The brake assist system is activated, each solenoid operates as shown in the table on the next page.
