EG-134 ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE
11. Evaporative Emission Control System
General
The evaporative emission control system prevents the vapor gas that is created in the fuel tank from being
released directly into the atmosphere.
The basic structure and operations of this system is the same as those used on 2AZ-FE engine models, except
for the arrangements of some parts. For details, refer to page EG-60.
