2. P0456: EVAP very small leak
In operation C, the vacuum pump creates negative pressure (vacuum) in the EVAP system and the
EVAP system pressure is measured. If the stabilized system pressure is higher than the second 0.02
inch leak pressure standard, the ECM determines that the EVAP system has a small leak, illuminates
the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
