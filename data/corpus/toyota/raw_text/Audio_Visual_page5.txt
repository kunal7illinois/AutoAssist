deformation of the disc, making the disc
unusable.)
• Do not use odd-shaped CDs because these
may cause player malfunctions.

transparent or translucent because they may
not be inserted, ejected, or played normally.

up, mist and also dew may form in the player. In
such a case, the CD may skip or the CD may
stop in the middle of play. Ventilate or dehumidify
the cabin for a while before using the player.
• The CD may skip if the player experiences strong
vibrations when the vehicle is driven on rough
road or similar uneven surface(s).

Do not use a lens cleaner because it may cause
a malfunction in the pickup portion of the player.

soft dry cloth such as an eyeglass cleaner for
plastic lenses from the inside to the outside in a
radial direction.

• Pressing on the disc by hand or rubbing
the disc with a hard cloth may scratch the
disc surface.
