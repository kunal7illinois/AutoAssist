9. "Bluetooth" outline
(a) "Bluethooth" is a trademark owned by Bluetooth
SIG. Inc.
(b) "Bluetooth" is a new wireless connection technology
that uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band. This makes
it possible to connect a cellular phone ("Bluetooth"
compatible phone *1) to the radio and navigation
assembly (the "Bluetooth" system is built in), and
use the handsfree function of the cellular phone,
E100921 even if it is in a pocket or bag. As a result, it is not
necessary to use a connector attached directly to
the cellular phone.
*1: Some versions of "Bluetooth" compatible cellular
phones may not function.
Example:
Radio and Navigation Assembly
(Built-in “Bluetooth” receiver antenna)
Cellular Phone (”Bluetooth” type)

HINT:
The communication performance of "Bluetooth"
may vary depending on obstructions or radio wave
conditions between communication devices,
electromagnetic radiation, communication device NS
sensitivity, or antenna capacity.
