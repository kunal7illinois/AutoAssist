INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• DTC P2610 is set if an internal ECM problem is detected. In this case, diagnostic procedures are not
required. ECM replacement is required.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame
data can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine
was warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the
time of a malfunction (See page ES-45).
1 REPLACE ECM
(a) Replace the ECM (See page ES-518).
