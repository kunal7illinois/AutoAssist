9 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR SIGNAL WAVEFORM
(a) Lift up the vehicle.
(b) Perform the inspection using the oscilloscope.
Skid Control ECU (Harness Side
(1) Disconnect the skid control ECU connector.
Connector Front View):
BC
(2) Connect the oscilloscope to terminals of the skid
control ECU.
(3) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
rotated.
RL- RL+ RR- RR+ OK:
The same waveforms is output from rear
wheels and there is no noise or interference in
the waveform.
HINT:
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed)
increases, the width of the waveform narrows
Normal Signal Waveform:
and the output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated
due to rotor scratches, looseness or foreign
matter attached to the speed sensor.
GND
(4) Connect the connectors.
NG CLEAN OR REPLACE SPEED SENSOR AND
