STEERING COLUMN – ELECTRIC STEERING LOCK
Unlock Position Sensor Signal Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The unlock position sensor is one of the components in the steering lock actuator. The sensor switch
contact closes when the steering lock is released. The steering lock release signal is then sent to the main
body ECU. Receiving the signal, the ECU permits engine start. (This prevents the engine from being
started with the steering locked.)
