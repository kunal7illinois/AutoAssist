BC–394
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
VSC Warning Light does not Come ON
DESCRIPTION
The skid control ECU communicates with the combination meter assembly via CAN communication. If the
ECU stores a DTC, the master caution indicator light will illuminate, and the DTC will be displayed on the
multi-information display in the combination meter (models with multi-information display). On models
without a multi-information display, the VSC warning light will come on when the skid control ECU stores a
DTC.
