2. CHECK SPARK PLUG
(a) Check the electrode.
(1) Using a megohmmeter, measure the insulation
resistance.
Standard insulation resistance:
10 MΩ or more
HINT:
• If a megohmmeter is not available, perform
the following simple inspection instead.
Ground
• If the result is 10 MΩ or less, clean the plug
I039522E10
and measure the resistance again.
(b) Alternative inspection method:
(1) Quickly accelerate the engine to 4,000 rpm 5
times.
(2) Remove the spark plug.
(3) Visually check the spark plug.
If the electrode is dry, the spark plug is
functioning properly. If the electrode is damp,
proceed to the next step.
(c) Check the spark plug for any damage on its threads
and insulator.

(d) Check the spark plug electrode gap.
Maximum electrode gap for used spark plug:
1.3 mm (0.051 in.)
If the gap is greater than the maximum, replace the
spark plug.
Electrode gap for new spark plug:
1.0 to 1.1 mm (0.039 to 0.043 in.)
1.0 to 1.1 mm
