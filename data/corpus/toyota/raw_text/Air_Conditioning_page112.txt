AC–112
AIR CONDITIONING – AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
Steering Pad Switch Circuit
DESCRIPTION
AUTO, OFF, TEMP UP (+), and TEMP DOWN (-) switches are located on the steering pad switch. The
resistance of the steering pad switch changes in accordance with switch operation. The A/C control
assembly outputs voltage to the steering pad switch and reads voltage changes due to the resistance
changes that result from switch operation.
HINT:
If there is an open in the circuit, the A/C system cannot be operated by the steering pad switch assembly.
If there is a short in the circuit, the resulting condition is the same as if the switch were continuously
depressed. Therefore, the A/C control assembly cannot be operated by the steering pad switch assembly,
and the A/C control assembly will not be able to function correctly.
