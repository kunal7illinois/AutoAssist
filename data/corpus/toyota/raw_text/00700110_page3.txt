(2) Move the shift lever to P or neutral.
(3) Connect SST to 9 (TAC) of the DLC3 terminal,
and then connect a tachometer to SST.
SST 09843-18030
(4) Warm up the engine.
(5) Check the idle speed while the radiator-cooling
fan is not rotating.
Standard idle speed:
600 to 700 rpm
TAC DLC3 (6) Turn the ignition switch OFF.
(7) Remove the tachometer and disconnect SST
H100769E32
from the DLC3.
9. INSPECT COMPRESSION
(a) Warm up and stop the engine.
(b) Remove the No. 1 engine under cover.
(c) Remove the 4 ignition coils (see page IG-9).
EM
(d) Remove the 4 spark plugs.
(e) Disconnect the 4 fuel injector connectors.
(f) Set SST and a compression gauge.
SST Compression Gauge SST 09992-00500
(g) Insert the compression gauge into the spark plug
hole.
(h) While cranking the engine, measure the
compression pressure.
Standard compression pressure:
1,300 kPa (13.8 kgf/cm2, 196 psi)
Minimum pressure:
A013304E05 1,000 kPa (10 kgf/cm2, 142 psi)
Standard difference between each cylinder:
100 kPa (1.0 kgf/cm2, 14 psi)
NOTICE:
• Always use a fully charged battery to obtain
an engine speed of 250 rpm or more.
• Check the other cylinders' compression
pressures in the same way.
• This measurement must be done as quickly
as possible.
If the cylinder compression is low, pour a small
amount of engine oil into the cylinder through the
spark plug hole and inspect again.
HINT:
• If adding oil increases the compression, the
piston rings and/or cylinder bore may be worn or
damaged.
• If pressure stays low, a valve may be stuck or
seated improperly, or there may be leakage in
the gasket.
(i) Connect the 4 fuel injector connectors.
(j) Install the 4 spark plugs.
Torque:25 N*m (255 kgf*cm, 18 ft.*lbf)
(k) Install the 4 ignition coils (see page IG-9).
(l) Install the No. 1 engine under cover.
