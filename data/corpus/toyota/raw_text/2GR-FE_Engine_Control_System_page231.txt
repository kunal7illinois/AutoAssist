ES–231
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
If there is no signal from the crankshaft position sensor despite the engine revolving, the ECM interprets
this as a malfunction of the sensor.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, these DTCs are set 10 seconds after the engine is next
started.
MONITOR STRATEGY
P0335: CKP sensor signal check when starter ON
Related DTCs P0335: CKP sensor signal check when starter OFF
P0335: sensor pulse check
