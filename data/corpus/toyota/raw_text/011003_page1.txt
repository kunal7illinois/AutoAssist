2AZ-FE EMISSION CONTROL – AIR FUEL RATIO SENSOR
REMOVAL
1. DISCONNECT CABLE FROM NEGATIVE BATTERY
TERMINAL
CAUTION:
Wait at least 90 seconds after disconnecting the
cable from the negative (-) battery terminal to
prevent airbag and seat belt pretensioner activation.
2. REMOVE AIR FUEL RATIO SENSOR (for Bank 1
Sensor 1)
(a) Disconnect the sensor connector.
(b) Using SST, remove the sensor from the exhaust
manifold.

INSPECTION
1. INSPECT AIR FUEL RATIO SENSOR (for Bank 1
Sensor 1)
(a) Measure the resistance of the sensor.
EC Standard resistance
+B
Tester Connection Specified Condition
HA1A 1 (HA1A) - 2 (+B) 1.8 to 3.4 Ω at 20°C (68°F)
1 (HA1A) - 4 (A1A-) 10 kΩ or higher
A1A- A1A+
A133069E01
If the resistance is not as specified, replace the
sensor.
INSTALLATION
1. INSTALL AIR FUEL RATIO SENSOR (for Bank 1
Sensor 1)
(a) Using SST, install the sensor to the exhaust
30 cm manifold.
SST 09224-00010
Torque:40 N*m (408 kgf*cm, 30 ft.*lbf) for use
with SST

without SST
HINT:
• Use a torque wrench with a fulcrum length of 30
cm (11.81 in.).
• Make sure SST and wrench are connected in a
straight line.
(b) Connect the sensor connector.
2. CONNECT CABLE TO NEGATIVE BATTERY
TERMINAL
3. CHECK FOR EXHAUST GAS LEAKS
