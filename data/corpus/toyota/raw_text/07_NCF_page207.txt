Service Tip
ATF Filling procedure using SST (09843-18040)
When a large amount of ATF needs to be filled (i.e. after removal and installation of oil pan or torque
converter), perform the procedure from step 1.
When a small amount of ATF is required (i.e. removal and installation of oil cooler tube, repair of
a minor oil leak), perform the procedure from step 7.
1) Raise the vehicle while keeping it level.
2) Remove the refill plug and overflow plug.
3) Fill the transaxle with WS type ATF through the refill plug hole until it overflows from the
overflow plug hole.
(cid:1) ATF WS must be used to fill the transaxle.
4) Reinstall the overflow plug.
5) Add the specified amount of ATF (specified amount is determined by the procedure that was
performed) and reinstall the refill plug.

10) Move the shift lever to the D position, and then quickly move it back and forth between N and
D (at least once every 1.5 seconds) for at least 6 seconds. This will activate oil temperature
detection mode.
Standard: The shift position indicator light “D” remains illuminated for 2 seconds and
then goes off.
11) Return the shift lever to the P position and disconnect the TC terminal.
12) Idle the engine to raise the ATF temperature.
13) Immediately after the shift position indicator “D” light turns on, lift the vehicle up.
(cid:1) The shift position indicator light “D” will indicate the ATF temperature according to the
following table.
