EG-102 ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE
(cid:4)IGNITION SYSTEM
1. General
A DIS (Direct Ignition System) is used. The DIS improves the ignition timing accuracy, reduces high-voltage
loss, and enhances the overall reliability of the ignition system by eliminating the distributor.
The DIS is an independent ignition system which has one ignition coil (with igniter) for each cylinder.

contact to spark plugs, are integrated with an
ignition coil. Also, an igniter is enclosed to
simplify the system.
