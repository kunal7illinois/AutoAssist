(c) Connect the intelligent tester together with the CAN VIM (Controller Area Network Vehicle
Interface Module) to the DLC3.
(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(e) Turn on the tester.
(f) Enter the following items: "DIAGNOSIS / OBD/MOBD / ECT / DATA LIST".
(g) According to the display on tester, read "DATA LIST".

HINT:
When DTC P0712 is output and intelligent tester indicates 150°C (302°F) or more, there is a
short circuit.
When DTC P0713 is output and intelligent tester indicates -40°C (-40°F), there is an open
circuit.
Measure the resistance between terminal OIL and body ground.
Temperature Displayed Malfunction
-40°C (-40°F) Open circuit
150 °C (302°F) or more Short circuit
HINT:
If the circuit related to the ATF temperature sensor becomes open, P0713 is immediately set (in
0.5 seconds). When P0713 is set, P0711 cannot be detected.
It is not necessary to inspect the circuit when P0711 is set.

(a) Remove the TCM from the transaxle.
(b) Measure the resistance according to the value(s) in the
table below.
THO1 Standard resistance
Tester Connection Specified Condition
E2 17 (E2) - 18 (THO1) 90 Ω to 156 kΩ
17 (E2) - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
18 (THO1) - Body ground 10 kΩ or higher
HINT:
If the resistance is out of the specified range with the
ATF temperature shown in the table below, the
driveability of the vehicle may decrease.
