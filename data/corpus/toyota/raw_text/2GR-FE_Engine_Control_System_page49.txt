2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
4. FREEZE FRAME DATA
The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is
stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can be
helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or
stopped, whether the engine was warmed up or not,
whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as
other data recorded at the time of a malfunction.
5. DLC3 (Data link Connector 3)
The vehicle's ECM uses ISO 15765-4 for communication
DLC3 protocol. The terminal arrangement of the DLC3
complies with SAE J1962 and matches the ISO 15765-4
format.

HINT:
The DLC3 is the interface prepared for reading various
data from the vehicle's ECM. After connecting the cable
of an intelligent tester, turn the ignition switch on (IG) and
turn the tester on. If a communication failure message is
displayed on the tester screen (on the tester: UNABLE
TO CONNECT TO VEHICLE), a problem exists in either
the vehicle or tester. In order to identify the location of
the problem, connect the tester to another vehicle.
If communication is normal: Inspect the DLC3 on the
original vehicle.
If communication is still not possible: The problem is
probably in the tester itself. Consult the Service
Department listed in the instruction manual.
6. BATTERY VOLTAGE
Standard Voltage:
11 to 14 V
If voltage is below 11 V, replace or recharge the battery
before proceeding to the next step.
7. MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp)
(a) The MIL is illuminated when the engine switch is
first turned on (the engine is not running).
