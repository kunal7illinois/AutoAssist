10. INSPECT CO/HC
HINT:
The ECM properly controls the CO/HC concentration in
the emission gas.
(a) Start and warm up the engine.
(b) Run the engine at 2,500 rpm for approximately 180
seconds.
(c) Insert the CO/HC meter testing probe at least 40 cm
(1.3 ft.) into the tailpipe while idling.
(d) Inspect the CO/HC concentration while idling and/or
at 2,500 rpm.
If the CO/HC concentration is not as specified,
perform troubleshooting.
HINT:
See the table below for possible causes, and then
inspect and repair the applicable causes if
EM necessary.
CO HC Problems Causes
Normal High Rough idle 1. Faulty ignition:
- Incorrect timing
- Plugs are contaminated, shorted,
or gaps are defective
2. Incorrect valve clearance
3. Leaks in intake and exhaust
valve
4. Leaks in cylinders
Low High Rough idle 1. Vacuum leakage:
(Fluctuating HC reading) - Ventilation hoses
- Intake manifold
- Throttle body
- Brake booster line
2. Lean mixture causing misfire
High High Rough idle 1. Restricted air filter
(Black smoke from exhaust) 2. Plugged PCV valve
3. Faulty SFI system:
- Faulty pressure regulator
- Faulty engine coolant
temperature sensor
- Faulty mass air flow meter
- Faulty ECM
- Faulty injectors
- Faulty throttle body
