CAN COMMUNICATION – CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
NOTICE:
• Turn the ignition switch off before measuring the resistance of the CAN main wire and CAN
branch wires.
• After the ignition switch is turned off, check that the key reminder warning system and light
reminder warning system are not operating.
• Before measuring the resistance, leave the vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not operate
the ignition switch, any other switches or the doors. If doors need to be opened in order to
check connectors, open the doors and leave them open.
HINT:
Operating the ignition switch, any other switches or any triggers related ECU and sensor communication
on the CAN, which would cause resistance reading variations.
1 CHECK CAN BUS WIRE (MAIN BUS WIRE FOR DISCONNECTION, BUS WIRES FOR
SHORT CIRCUIT)
