(cid:2)LIGHTWEIGHT AND HIGHLY RIGID BODY
1. High Strength Sheet Steel
(cid:1) High strength sheet steel is used in order to ensure body rigidity and realize a lightweight body.
(cid:1) In the front pillar reinforcement, center pillar reinforcement and rocker members, ultra high strength sheet
steel is used.
(cid:1) Ultra high strength sheet steel has approximately 1.3 times the strength of conventional high strength sheet
steel. Therefore, to provide the same strength of high strength sheet steel, a weight reduction of
approximately 25% can be realized.
