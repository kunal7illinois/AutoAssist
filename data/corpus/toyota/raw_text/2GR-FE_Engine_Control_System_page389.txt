MONITOR DESCRIPTION
After the engine is warmed up, the ECM performs air-fuel ratio feedback control to maintain the air-fuel
ratio at the stoichiometric level. In addition, active A/F ratio control is performed for approximately 10
seconds after preconditions are met in order to measure the A/F sensor response rate. During active A/F
ratio control, the ECM forcibly increases and decreases the injection volume by a certain amount, based
on the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio learned during normal air-fuel ratio control, and measures the A/F
sensor response rate. The ECM receives a signal from the A/F sensor while performing active A/F ratio
control and uses it to calculate the A/F sensor response rate deterioration level.
If the value for A/F sensor response rate deterioration level is less than the threshold, the ECM interprets
this as a malfunction and sets the DTC.
