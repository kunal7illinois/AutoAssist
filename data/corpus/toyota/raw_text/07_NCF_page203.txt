CHASSIS - U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE CH-39
(cid:1)DIFFERENTIAL CASE
The curvature of the differential case opening, where tensile stress is concentrated during driving, is enlarged,
in order to moderate the stress concentration and enhance the differential gear tolerant torque. As a result,
use of the lightweight 2-pinion differential gears is possible.
