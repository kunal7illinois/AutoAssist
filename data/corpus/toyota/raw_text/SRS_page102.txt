DESCRIPTION
The circuit for the side collision sensor RH (to determine deployment of the front seat side airbag
assembly RH and curtain shield airbag assembly RH) is composed of the center airbag sensor assembly,
side airbag sensor RH, and rear airbag sensor RH.
The side airbag sensor RH and rear airbag sensor RH detect impacts to the vehicle and send signals to
RS
the center airbag sensor assembly to determine if the airbag should be deployed.
DTC B1627/82, B1628/82, B1637/82, B1638/82, B1647/82, or B1648/82 is recorded when a malfunction
is detected in the circuit for the side collision sensor RH.
