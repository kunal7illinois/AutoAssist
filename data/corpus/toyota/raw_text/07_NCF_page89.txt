the signals to the ECM.
Sensor
Opens in accordance with the signals from the ECM when the
system is purging, in order to send the fuel vapors that were
Purge VSV absorbed by the canister into the intake manifold. In system
monitoring mode, this valve controls the introduction of the
vacuum into the fuel tank.
Canister Filter Prevents dust and debris in the fresh air from entering the system.
Controls the canister pump module and the purge VSV in
accordance with the signals from various sensors, in order to
ECM achieve a purge volume that suits the driving conditions. In
addition, the ECM monitors the system for any leakage and outputs
a DTC if a malfunction is found.
