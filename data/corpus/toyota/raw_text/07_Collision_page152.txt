DI-2 BODY DIMENSIONS
2. MEASURING
Plate Looseness
(a) Basically, all measurements are to be done with a tracking
Body Looseness
gauge. For portions where it is not possible to use a track-
ing gauge, a tape measure should be used.
(b) Use only a tracking gauge that has no looseness in the
body, measuring plate, or pointers.

Wrong Correct
2) Always calibrate the tracking gauge before measuring
or after adjusting the pointer height.
3) Take care not to drop the tracking gauge or otherwise
shock it.
4) Confirm that the pointers are securely in the holes.
