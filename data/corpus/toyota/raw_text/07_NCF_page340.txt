BE-6 BODY ELECTRICAL - MULTIPLEX COMMUNICATION
(cid:3)DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CAN, AVC-LAN AND BEAN
1. General
(cid:3) The protocols, which are the rules for establishing data communication, differ between the CAN,
AVC-LAN and BEAN*. If the ECUs in the networks use different frameworks for their data, such as
communication speed, communication wire, and signals, they will be unable to understand each other.
Therefore, protocols (rules) must be established among them.
(cid:3) Compared to the AVC-LAN and BEAN*, the CAN features high-speed data transmission. Therefore, the
CAN is able to transmit larger amounts of data faster than other protocols. This feature makes it possible
to transmit data accurately in the power train and chassis control system, which requires large amounts
of data to be transmitted in short periods of time.
*: The BEAN is used in the body electrical system of the ’06 Camry and some other TOYOTA models, but
is not used on the ’07 Camry.
