INSPECTION
1. INSPECT CYLINDER HEAD FOR WARPAGE
(a) Using a precision straightedge and feeler gauge,
measure the warpage of the contact surfaces of the
cylinder block and manifolds.
Maximum warpage:
0.08 mm (0.0032 in.)
Cylinder Block Side If the warpage is greater than the maximum, replace
the cylinder head sub-assembly.

2. INSPECT CYLINDER HEAD FOR CRACKS
(a) Using a dye penetrant, inspect the combustion
chamber, intake ports, exhaust ports and cylinder
block surface for cracks.
If cracked, replace the cylinder head.
3. INSPECT VALVE SEAT
(a) Apply a light coat of Prussian blue to the valve face.
(b) Lightly press the valve against the seat.
NOTICE:
A013365E01 Do not turn the valve.
(c) Check the valve face and seat in accordance with
the following procedure.
(1) If blue appears 360° around the face, the valve
is concentric. If not, replace the valve.
(2) If blue appears 360° around the valve seat, the
guide and face are concentric. If not, resurface
the valve seat (see page EM-87).
Width
(3) Check that the seat contact is in the middle of
the valve face with a width.
