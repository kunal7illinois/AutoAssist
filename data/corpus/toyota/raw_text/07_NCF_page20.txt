MO-20 NEW MODEL OUTLINE
Smart Key System
The smart key system provides a key with a bi-directional communication function. Accordingly, by enabling
the certification ECU to recognize the presence of the key within the detection area, this system can lock or
unlock the doors, or start the engine without the use of the key, as long as the user has the key in his/her
possession.
