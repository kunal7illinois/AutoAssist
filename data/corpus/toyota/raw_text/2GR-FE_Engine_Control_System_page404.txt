5 INSPECT ENGINE MOUNTING INSULATOR ASSEMBLY FRONT
(a) Disconnect the vacuum hose from the front engine
mount insulator.
(b) Using a vacuum pump, apply vacuum of 80 kPa (600
mmHg, 25 in.Hg) and wait for 1 minute.
(c) Check that there is no change in the needle movement
of the vacuum pump gauge.
(d) Check that there is no fluid leakage caused by a break in
the diaphragm.
OK:
Vacuum pressure exists.
