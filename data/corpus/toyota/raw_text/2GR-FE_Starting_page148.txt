2GR-FE STARTING – STARTER
(b) Inspect the resistance of the commutator.
(1) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
between the segments of the commutator.
Standard resistance
Tester connection Specified condition
Below 1 Ω Segment - Segment Below 1 Ω
If the resistance is not as specified, replace the
Segment
starter armature assembly.

(2) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
between the commutator and armature coil
10 kΩ or Higher
core.
Standard resistance
Tester connection Specified condition
Commutator Commutator - Armature coil core 10 kΩ or higher
Coil Core If the resistance is not as specified, replace the
starter armature assembly.

(c) Using vernier calipers, measure the commutator
depth.
Specified depth:
3.1 mm (0.122 in.)
Maximum depth:
Depth
3.8 mm (0.150 in.)
If the depth is greater than the maximum, replace
the starter armature assembly.

4. INSPECT STARTER COMMUTATOR END FRAME
ASSEMBLY
(a) Check the brush length.
(1) Using vernier calipers, measure the brush
Length length.
Specified length:
9.0 mm (0.354 in.)
Maximum length:
4.0 mm (0.157 in.)
If the length is less than the minimum, replace
A076677E10
the starter commutator end frame assembly.
(b) Check the resistance.
(1) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
10 kΩ or Higher
ST
between the positive (+) and negative (-)
brushes.
Resistance:
10 kΩ or higher
If the resistance is not as specified, repair or
replace the starter commutator end frame
assembly.
