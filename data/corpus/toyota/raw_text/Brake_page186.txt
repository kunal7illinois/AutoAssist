DESCRIPTION
If a DTC of the motor line is stored, the VSC NO. 1 (fail safe) relay cuts off the power supply to the VSC
NO. 2 relay and performs fail safe.
While any of the ABS, TRAC, VSC, or BA is operating, the skid control ECU (housed in the actuator
assembly) turns the VSC NO. 2 relay on and activates the pump motor in the brake actuator.
This code may be stored if the motor relay (BM) voltage becomes lower than the DTC detecting condition
due to insufficient output from the battery or alternator.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
BC When any of the following (1 or 2) is detected:
1. All of the following conditions continue for 0.12 seconds or
more.
• The IG1 terminal voltage is between 9.5 and 17.2 V. • ABS NO. 1 fuse
• During initial check and ABS, BA, TRAC, or VSC are • VSC NO. 2 relay

operating. • VSC NO. 2 relay circuit
• Relay contact is open when the relay is ON. • Brake actuator assembly
2. All of the following conditions continue for 0.12 seconds.
• The IG1 terminal voltage is 9.5 V or less.
• Relay contact remains open when the relay is ON.
• ABS NO. 1 fuse
When the motor relay is OFF, the VSC NO. 2 relay remains • VSC NO. 2 relay

• Brake actuator assembly
• ABS NO. 1 fuse
Immediately after the ignition switch is turned on (IG), the
• VSC NO. 1 (fail safe) relay
