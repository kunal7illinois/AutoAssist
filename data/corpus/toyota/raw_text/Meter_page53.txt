ME–53
METER – METER / GAUGE SYSTEM
Fuel Receiver Gauge Malfunction
DESCRIPTION
The meter CPU uses the fuel sender gauge assembly to determine the level of the fuel in the fuel tank.
The resistance of the fuel sender gauge will vary between approximately 15 Ω with the float at the full
position, and 410 Ω with the float at the empty position. The meter outputs battery voltage through two
820 Ω resistors that are mounted in parallel inside the meter ECU. The meter CPU measures the voltage
between the variable resistor in the fuel sender gauge and the two resistors mounted in parallel in the
meter. Voltage measured at this point will vary as the float of the fuel sender gauge is moved. The highest
voltage observed should be approximately half of battery voltage.
HINT:
The fuel level warning light will come on when the fuel level is below 10.5 liters.
