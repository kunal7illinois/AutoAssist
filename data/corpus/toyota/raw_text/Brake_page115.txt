BC–109
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
(1) Operation description
The skid control ECU receives a speed signal
from each wheel speed sensor, and uses these
signals to detect locking of the wheels. The ECU
uses this information in order to determine
appropriate control of the solenoid valves.
The solenoid valves control the hydraulic
pressure applied to the brake cylinder at each
wheel. In this way, the solenoid valves are used
to control the brake power split between the front
and rear, and left and right wheels. The BRAKE
warning light will come on if there is a
malfunction in the EBD system.
