sure to check the conditions at the time the
malfunction occurred, such as by the DTC output
and the freeze frame data output, and record it
before disconnecting each connector or removing
and installing parts.

and each individual sensor with the ignition switch
off unless otherwise specified in the inspection
procedure.
