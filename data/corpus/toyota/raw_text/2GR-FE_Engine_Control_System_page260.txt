2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
• Following the A/F CONTROL procedure enables technicians to check and graph the output voltages of
both the A/F and HO2 sensors.
• To display the graph, enter the following menus on the tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II /
ACTIVE TEST / A/F CONTROL / USER DATA / AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2 or AFS B2 S1 and O2S B2
S2, and press the YES button and then the ENTER button followed by the F4 button.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. The ECM records vehicle and driving condition
information as freeze frame data the moment a DTC is stored. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data
can be helpful in determining whether the vehicle was running or stopped, whether the engine was
warmed up or not, whether the air-fuel ratio was lean or rich, as well as other data recorded at the time of
a malfunction (See page ES-45).
ES
1 CHECK ANY OTHER DTCS OUTPUT (IN ADDITION TO DTC P0420 AND/OR P0430)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) and turn the tester on.
(c) Enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED
OBD II / DTC INFO / CURRENT CODES.
(d) Read the DTCs.
Result
Display (DTC output) Proceed to
P0420 and/or P0430 A
P0420 and/or P0430 and other DTCs B
HINT:
If any DTCs other than P0420 or P0430 are output,
troubleshoot those DTCs first.
B GO TO DTC CHART (See page ES-63)
A
2 PERFORM ACTIVE TEST BY INTELLIGENT TESTER (A/F CONTROL)
(a) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(b) Start the engine and turn the tester on.
(c) Warm up the engine at a engine speed of 2,500 rpm for
approximately 90 seconds.
(d) On the tester, enter the following menus: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST / A/F CONTROL.
(e) Perform the A/F CONTROL operation with the engine in
an idling condition (press the RIGHT or LEFT button to
change the fuel injection volume.)
(f) Monitor the output voltages of the A/F and HO2 sensors
(AFS B1 S1 and O2S B1 S2 or AFS B2 S1 and O2S B2
S2) displayed on the tester.
HINT:
• The A/F CONTROL operation lowers the fuel injection
volume by 12.5 % or increases the injection volume
by 25 %.
