COOLING SYSTEM
ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. CHECK COOLING SYSTEM FOR LEAKS
(a) Remove the radiator reservoir cap.
CAUTION:
To avoid the danger of being burned, do not
remove the radiator reservoir cap while the
engine and radiator are still hot. Thermal
expansion will cause hot engine coolant and
steam to blow out from the radiator reservoir.
(b) Fill the radiator and reservoir with coolant, and then
Radiator Cap Tester
attach a radiator cap tester.
(c) Warm up the engine.
(d) Pump the radiator cap tester to 118 kPa (1.2 kgf/
cm2, 17.1 psi), and then check that the pressure
does not drop.
If the pressure drops, check the hoses, radiator and
water pump for leakage.
If there are no signs of external coolant leaks, check
A112194E01 the heater core, cylinder block and head.
(e) Reinstall the radiator reservoir cap.
2. CHECK ENGINE COOLANT LEVEL OF RESERVOIR
(a) The engine coolant should be between the LOW
and FULL lines when the engine is cold.
If low, check for leakage and add TOYOTA Super
Long Life Coolant (SLLC) or similar high quality
ethylene glycol based non-silicate, non-amine, non-
nitrite, and non-borate coolant with long-life hybrid
organic acid technology up to the FULL line.

3. CHECK ENGINE COOLANT QUALITY
A112306 (a) Remove the radiator reservoir cap.
CAUTION:
To avoid the danger of being burned, do not
remove the radiator reservoir cap while the
engine and radiator are still hot. Thermal
expansion will cause hot engine coolant and
steam to blow out from the radiator.
(b) Check for any excessive deposits of rust or scale
around the radiator reservoir cap and radiator filler
hole; the coolant should be free of oil.
If excessively dirty, replace the coolant.
(c) Install the radiator reservoir cap.
