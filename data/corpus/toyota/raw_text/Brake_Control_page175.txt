DTC C0210/33 Rear Speed Sensor RH Circuit
DTC C0215/34 Rear Speed Sensor LH Circuit
Low Output Signal of Rear Speed Sensor RH
DTC C1273/73
(Test Mode DTC)
Low Output Signal of Rear Speed Sensor LH
DTC C1274/74
(Test Mode DTC)
DESCRIPTION
The speed sensors detect wheel speed and transmit the signals to the ECU. These signals are used for
control of the ABS control system. Each of the front and rear rotors have 48 serrations.
When the rotors rotate, the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet in the speed sensor
induces an AC voltage.
BC
Since the frequency of this AC voltage changes in direct proportion to the speed of the rotor, the
frequency is used by the ECU to detect the speed of each wheel.
DTCs C1273/73 and C1274/74 can be deleted when the speed sensor sends a wheel speed signal or the
Test Mode ends. DTCs C1273/73 and C1274/74 are output only in the Test Mode.

When any of the following is detected:
1. At a vehicle speed of 6 mph (10 km/h) or more, an open
• Rear speed sensor RH/LH
or short in the sensor signal circuit continues for 1 second
• Speed sensor circuit
C0210/33 or more.
• Speed sensor rotor
C0215/34 2. Momentary interruption of the sensor signal from the

abnormal wheel occurs 7 times or more.
• Brake actuator assembly (Skid control ECU)
3. An open in the speed sensor signal circuit continues for
0.5 seconds or more.
HINT:
• DTC C0210/33 is for the rear speed sensor RH.
• DTC C0215/34 is for the rear speed sensor LH.
