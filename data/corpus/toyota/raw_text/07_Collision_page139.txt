BODY PANEL SEALING AREAS
Be sure to apply body sealer to the body panel joints and door edges (tip of outer panel folded part), etc., to water-
proof and rustproof them.
HINT:
1) Apply degreasing agent to a clean cloth and clean the sealer application areas.
2) After removing the applied spot sealer from the sealer application areas using thinner or equivalent, rustproof
the areas by applying primer or equivalent. Then apply body sealer.
3) If sealer is unnecessarily applied to an area, apply degreasing agent to a clean cloth and clean off the sealer
immediately.
