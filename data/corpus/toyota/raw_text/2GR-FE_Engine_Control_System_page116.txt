HINT:
• When any of these DTCs are set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. The ECM turns off the A/F sensor
heater in fail-safe mode. Fail-safe mode continues until the engine switch is turned off.
• The ECM provides a pulse width modulated control circuit to adjust the current through the heater. The
A/F sensor heater circuit uses a relay on the B+ side of the circuit.
