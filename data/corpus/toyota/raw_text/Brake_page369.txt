2 INSPECT SPEED SENSOR AND SENSOR ROTOR SERRATIONS
(a) Lift up the vehicle.
Skid Control ECU (Harness Side
(b) Disconnect the skid control ECU connector.

(c) Connect the oscilloscope to each speed sensor terminal
of the skid control ECU connector.

(d) Check that a waveform is output when the tires are
Normal Signal Waveform: rotated (by the sensor circuit).
OK:
A waveform as shown in the figure is output.
HINT:
• Each sensor circuit outputs the same waveform
without noise.
• As vehicle speed (wheel rotation speed) increases,
GND the width of the waveform narrows and the fluctuation
in the output voltage becomes greater.
• When noise is identified in the waveform on the
oscilloscope, the erratic signals are generated due to
rotor scratches, looseness or foreign matter attached
1 V/Division, 2 ms./Division
to the speed sensor.
(e) Make sure that the waveform does not change while
C140980E03 jiggling a connector or a wire harness.
OK:
The waveform does not change.
HINT:
If the waveform changes while jiggling a connector or a
wire harness, there may be a malfunction in the
connector or the wire harness.
(f) Connect the connector.

3 RECONFIRM DTC
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-302).
(b) Start the engine.
(c) Drive the vehicle at a speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) or more
for 60 seconds or more.
