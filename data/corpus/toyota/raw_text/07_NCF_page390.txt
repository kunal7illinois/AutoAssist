BE-56 BODY ELECTRICAL - AIR CONDITIONING
5. A/C Pressure Sensor
A/C pressure sensor detects the refrigerant pressure and outputs it to the A/C ECU in the form of voltage
changes.
6. Room Temp. Sensor and Outside Temp. Sensor
(cid:1) The room temperature sensor detects the room temperature based on changes in the resistance of its
built-in thermistor and sends a signal to the A/C ECU. This sensor is used on models with automatic air
conditioning.
(cid:1) The outside temperature sensor detects the outside temperature based on changes in the resistance of its
built-in thermistor and sends a signal to the A/C ECU.
7. Solar Sensor
(cid:1) The solar sensor consists of a photo diode, two amplifier circuits for the solar sensor, and a frequency
converter circuit for the light control sensor. This sensor is used on models with automatic air conditioning.
(cid:1) A solar sensor detects (in the form of changes in the current that flows through the built-in photo diode)
the changes in the amount of sunlight from the LH and RH sides (2 directions) and outputs these sunlight
strength signals to the A/C ECU.
