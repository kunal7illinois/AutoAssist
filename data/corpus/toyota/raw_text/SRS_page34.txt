RS–34
SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM – AIRBAG SYSTEM
NOTICE:
*: Before measuring the resistance, leave the
vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not
operate the ignition switch, any other switches,
or the doors.
If the result is not as specified, the DLC3 may have
a malfunction. Repair or replace the harness and
connector.
HINT:
If the display shows a communication error
message when connecting the cable of the
intelligent tester to the DLC3, turning the ignition
switch on (IG) and operating the intelligent tester,
there is a problem on the vehicle side or tester side.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
on the original vehicle.
• If communication is still not possible when the
tester is connected to another vehicle, the
problem is probably in the tester itself. Consult
the Service Department listed in the tester's
instruction manual.
2. SYMPTOM SIMULATION
HINT:
The most difficult case in troubleshooting is when no
symptoms occur. In such cases, a thorough customer
problem analysis must be carried out. Then the same or
similar conditions and environment in which the problem
RS occurred in the customer's vehicle should be
reproduced. No matter how experienced or skilled a
technician may be, if he proceeds to troubleshoot without
confirming the problem symptoms, he will likely overlook
something important and make a wrong guess at some
points in the repair operation.
This leads to a standstill in troubleshooting.
