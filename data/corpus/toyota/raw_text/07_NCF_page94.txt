b. Atmospheric Pressure Measurement
1)When the ignition switch is turned OFF, the purge VSV and the vent valve are turned OFF. Therefore,
atmospheric pressure is introduced into the canister.
2)The ECM measures the atmospheric pressure based on the signals provided by the canister pressure
sensor.
3)If the measurement value is out of standards, the ECM actuates the leak detection pump in order to
monitor the changes in the pressure.
