2GR-FE FUEL – FUEL SYSTEM
(e) Install SST (pressure gauge) using SST and a fuel
tube connector as shown in the illustration.
SST (Clip) SST 09268-31011 (09268-41500, 90467-13001,
SST (T-joint) 95336-08070), 09268-45014 (09268-41200,
09268-41220, 09268-41250)
(f) Wipe up any gasoline.
SST (Clip)
(g) Connect the negative (-) battery terminal.
(h) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
SST (Gauge)
(i) Select the following menu items: DIAGNOSIS /
ENHANCED OBD II / ACTIVE TEST / FUEL PUMP
SST (Hose) / SPD.
(j) Measure the fuel pressure.
Fuel pressure:
SST (Hose) SST (Clip) 304 to 343 kPa (3.1 to 3.5 kgf*cm2, 44.1 to 49.7
psi)
• If the fuel pressure is greater than the standard
SST
(Tube value, replace the fuel pressure regulator.
Connector) • If the fuel pressure is less than the standard
value, check the fuel hoses and connections, fuel
Fuel Tube
pump, fuel filter and fuel pressure regulator.
(k) Disconnect the intelligent tester from the DLC3.
A129461E01
(l) Start the engine. FU
(m) Measure the fuel pressure at idle.
Fuel pressure:
304 to 343 kPa (3.1 to 3.5 kgf*cm2, 44.1 to 49.7
psi)
(n) Stop the engine.
(o) Check that the fuel pressure remains as specified
for 5 minutes after the engine stops.
Fuel pressure:
147 kPa (1.5 kgf*cm2, 21 psi) or more
If the fuel pressure is not as specified, check the fuel
pump, pressure regulator and/or fuel injectors.
(p) After checking the fuel pressure, carefully
disconnect the negative (-) battery cable, and
remove the SST and fuel tube connector to prevent
gasoline from splashing.
(q) Reconnect the fuel tube to the main fuel tube (fuel
tube connector).
(r) Install the No. 1 fuel pipe clamp to the fuel tube
connector.
(s) Check for fuel leaks (step 1).
