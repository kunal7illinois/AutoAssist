DESCRIPTION
The Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor system consists of a CKP sensor plate and a pickup coil.
The sensor plate has 34 teeth and is installed on the crankshaft. The pickup coil is made of wound copper
wire, an iron core and magnet. The sensor plate rotates and, as each tooth passes through the pickup
coil, a pulse signal is created. The pickup coil generates 34 signals per engine revolution. Based on these
signals, the ECM calculates the crankshaft position and engine RPM. Using these calculations, the fuel
ES
injection time and ignition timing are controlled.
DTC No. DTC Detection Conditions Trouble Areas
When either condition below is met:
• Open or short in CKP sensor circuit
• No CKP sensor signal to ECM while cranking (1 trip
• CKP sensor
P0335 detection logic)
• CKP sensor plate
• No CKP sensor signal to ECM at engine speed of 600
• ECM
rpm or more (1 trip detection logic)
Under conditions (a), (b) and (c), no CKP sensor signal to
ECM for 0.05 seconds or more
• Open or short in CKP sensor circuit
(1 trip detection logic):
• CKP sensor
P0339 (a) Engine speed 1,000 rpm or more
• CKP sensor plate
(b) Starter signal OFF
• ECM
(c) 3 seconds or more have elapsed since starter signal
switched from ON to OFF

HINT:
• The correct waveform is as shown.
• G2+ stands for the Camshaft Position (CMP) sensor signal, and NE+ stands for the CKP sensor signal.
• Grounding failure of the shielded wire may cause noise in waveforms.

MONITOR DESCRIPTION
If there is no signal from the CKP sensor despite the engine revolving, the ECM interprets this as a
malfunction of the sensor.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 10 seconds after the engine is next started.
