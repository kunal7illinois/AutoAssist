ET–69
EXTERIOR – FRONT DOOR BLACK OUT TAPE
INSTALLATION
1. REPAIR INSTRUCTION
(a) Clean the vehicle body surface.
(1) Using a heat light, heat the vehicle body
surface.
Heating temperature
Item Temperature
Vehicle Body 40 to 60°C (104 to 140°F)
NOTICE:
Do not heat the vehicle body excessively.
(2) Wipe off any tape adhesive residue with
cleaner.
(b) Installation temperature
ET
(1) When ambient temperature is below 15°C,
perform the installation procedure after
warming the vehicle body surface (installation
surface of the door frame) and tape up to
between 20 to 30°C using a heat light. When
ambient temperature is above 35°C, cool the
vehicle body surface (installation surface of the
door frame) and tape down to between 20 to
30°C prior to installation.
HINT:
• The most appropriate temperature for
installing the tape is 25°C.
• When the temperature is low, the tape turns
stiff and comes off easily. When the
temperature is high, the tape looses
elasticity.
(c) Before installation
(1) Remove any roughness of coating and dirt on
and around the vehicle body surface where the
tape will be installed (installation surface of the
door frame). If any roughness or dirt remains
when pressing the tape onto the surface, air will
be trapped under the tape and result in a poor
appearance.
HINT:
Spray water on the shop floor to settle any dust.
(d) Key points for handling the tape
(1) The tape bends and rolls up easily. Store the
tape between flat pieces of cardboard or other
similar objects and keep it dry and level.
NOTICE:
Do not bend the tape or leave it in high
temperature places.
(e) Key points for installation of the tape (how to use a
squeegee and installation procedure for flat
surfaces)
NOTICE:
• Conduct positioning of the tape with a high
accuracy to achieve a neat finish and to avoid
peeling.
