(d) Map matching
The current driving route is calculated by
autonomous navigation (according to the gyro
sensor and vehicle speed sensor) and GPS
navigation. This information is then compared with
possible road shapes from the map data in the map
disc and the vehicle position is set onto the most
appropriate road.
