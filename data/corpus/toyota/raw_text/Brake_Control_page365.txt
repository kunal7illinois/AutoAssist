BC–354
BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for BOSCH Made)
INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• When U0073/94, U0100/63, U0123/62 and/or U0126/63 is output together with C1231/31, inspect and
repair the trouble areas indicated by U0073/94, U0100/65, U0123/62 and/or U0126/63 first.
• When the speed sensor or the yaw rate and acceleration sensor has trouble, DTCs for the steering
angle sensor may be output even when the steering angle sensor is normal. When DTCs for the speed
sensor or yaw rate and acceleration sensor are output together with other DTCs for the steering angle
sensor, inspect and repair the speed sensor and yaw rate and acceleration sensor first, and then
inspect and repair the steering angle sensor.
• Check the condition of each related circuit connector before troubleshooting (See page IN-40).
1 CHECK DTC
(a) Clear the DTC (See page BC-302).
(b) Turn the ignition switch off.
(c) Turn the ignition switch on (IG) again and check that no
CAN communication system DTC is output.
BC (d) Drive the vehicle and turn the steering wheel to the right
and left at the speed of 22 mph (35 km/h) and check that
no speed sensor and yaw rate and acceleration sensor
DTCs are output (See page BC-302).
Result
Condition Proceed to
No CAN communication system DTC and the speed sensor or yaw rate and
A
acceleration sensor DTC are output
CAN communication system DTC is output B
Speed sensor or yaw rate and acceleration sensor DTC is output C
HINT:
• If there is a malfunction in the speed sensor or the
yaw rate and acceleration sensor, an abnormal value
may be output although the steering angle sensor is
normal.
• If the speed sensor and the yaw rate and acceleration
sensor DTCs are output simultaneously, repair the
sensors and inspect the steering angle sensor.
