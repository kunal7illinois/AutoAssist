ENGINE - 2GR-FE ENGINE EG-107
System Outline
Air Fuel Ratio Maintains the temperature of the air fuel ratio sensor or oxygen sensor at an
Sensor and Oxygen appropriate level to increase accuracy of detection of the oxygen
Sensor Heater Control concentration in the exhaust gas.
(cid:1) The ECM controls the purge flow of evaporative emission (HC) in the
canister in accordance with engine conditions.

emission leakage occurring between the fuel tank and the canister through
changes in the fuel tank pressure.
Active Control
The damping characteristic of the front engine mount is controlled variably
Engine Mount
to reduce idling vibration.
