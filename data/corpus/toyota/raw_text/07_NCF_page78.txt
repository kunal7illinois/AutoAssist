7. VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing-intelligent) System
General
(cid:1) The VVT-i system is designed to control the intake camshaft within a range of 40(cid:2) (of Crankshaft Angle)
to provide valve timing that is optimally suited to the engine condition. This improves torque in all the
speed ranges as well as increasing fuel economy, and reducing exhaust emissions.

(cid:1) Using the engine speed, intake air volume, throttle position and water temperature, the ECM can
calculate optimal valve timing for each driving condition and controls the camshaft timing oil control
valve. In addition, the ECM uses signals from the camshaft position sensor and the crankshaft position
sensor to detect the actual valve timing, thus providing feedback control to achieve the target valve
timing.
