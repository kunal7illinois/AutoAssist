TW–20
TIRE AND WHEEL – TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM
INITIALIZATION
1. INITIALIZATION
NOTICE:
• Perform initialization after the transmitter ID
registration is completed.
• Initialization is necessary after replacing any of
the ECU, tires with different tire pressure, or tire
pressure warning valve and transmitter, or when a
new vehicle is delivered.
• Perform the tire pressure adjustment after the
vehicle has sufficiently cooled down. If the
vehicle is not sufficiently cooled down, increase
the air pressure by 20 to 30 kPa (0.2 to 0.3 kgf/
cm2, 2.9 to 4.3 psi) above the specified value.
(a) Set the air pressure of all wheels, including the
TW ground spare tire, to the specified value.

*1: For driving under 100 mph (160 km/h)
*2: For driving at 100 mph (160 km/h) or over
(b) Keep the tire pressure warning reset switch pressed
for 3 seconds or more with the ignition switch on
(IG).
(c) Check that the tire pressure warning light blinks 3
times (1 second ON, 1 second OFF).
HINT:
• Initialization will be completed if signals are
received from all the wheels. Initialization will be
canceled if the ignition switch is turned off during
initialization.
