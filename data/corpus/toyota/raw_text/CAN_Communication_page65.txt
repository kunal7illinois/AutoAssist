CAN COMMUNICATION – CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
• Before measuring the resistance, leave the vehicle as is for at least 1 minute and do not operate
the ignition switch, any other switches or the doors. If doors need to be opened in order to
check connectors, open the doors and leave them open.
HINT:
Operating the ignition switch, any other switches or any triggers related ECU and sensor communication
on the CAN, which would cause resistance reading variations.
