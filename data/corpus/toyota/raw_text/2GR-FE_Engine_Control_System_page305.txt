ES–305
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
DTC P0560 System Voltage
DESCRIPTION
The battery supplies electricity to the ECM even when the ignition switch is off. This power allows the
ECM to store data such as DTC history, freeze frame data and fuel trim values. If the battery voltage falls
below a minimum level, these memories are cleared and the ECM determines that there is a malfunction
in the power supply circuit. When the engine is next started, the ECM illuminates the MIL and sets the
DTC.
DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
Open in ECM back-up power source circuit • Open in back-up power source circuit
P0560
(1 trip detection logic) • ECM
HINT:
If DTC P0560 is set, the ECM does not store other DTCs.
