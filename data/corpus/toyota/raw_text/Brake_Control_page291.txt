(1) Operation description
The skid control ECU detects wheel lock
condition by receiving vehicle speed signals
from each speed sensor, and sends control
signals to the pump motor and solenoid valves.
The pump motor and solenoid valves avoid
wheel lock by controlling the hydraulic pressure
of each wheel cylinder.
The ABS warning light comes on when the ABS
system is malfunctioning.
