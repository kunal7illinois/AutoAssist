SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM – OCCUPANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
HINT:
If the display shows a communication error
message when connecting the cable of the
intelligent tester to the DLC3, turning the ignition
switch on (IG) and operating the intelligent tester,
there is a problem on the vehicle side or tester side.
• If communication is normal when the tester is
connected to another vehicle, inspect the DLC3
on the original vehicle.
• If communication is still not possible when the
tester is connected to another vehicle, the
problem is probably in the tester itself. Consult
the Service Department listed in the tester's
DLC3 instruction manual.

2. SYMPTOM SIMULATION
C131977E01
HINT:
The most difficult case in troubleshooting is when no
symptoms occur. In such cases, a thorough customer
problem analysis must be carried out. Then the same or
similar conditions and environment in which the problem
occurred in the customer's vehicle should be simulated.
No matter how experienced or skilled a technician may
be, if he proceeds to troubleshoot without confirming the
problem symptoms, he will likely overlook something
important and make a wrong guess at some points in the
repair operation.
This leads to a standstill in troubleshooting.
(a) Vibration method: When vibration seems to be the
Vibrate Slightly major cause. RS
HINT:
Perform the simulation method only during the
primary check period (for approximately 6 seconds
after the ignition switch is turned on (IG)).
(1) Slightly vibrate the part of the sensor considered
to be the problem cause with your fingers and
check whether the malfunction occurs.
HINT:
Shaking the relays too strongly may result in
open relays.
(2) Slightly shake the connector vertically and
Shake Slightly
horizontally.
(3) Slightly shake the wire harness vertically and
horizontally.
The connector joint and fulcrum of the vibration
are the major areas to be checked thoroughly.
