TYPICAL MALFUNCTION THRESHOLDS
P2102:
Throttle actuator current Less than 0.5 A
P2103:
Either of following conditions is met: A or B
A. Hybrid IC diagnosis signal Fail
B. Hybrid IC current limiter port Fail
FAIL-SAFE
When either of these DTCs, as well as other DTCs relating to ETCS (Electronic Throttle Control System)
malfunctions, is set, the ECM enters fail-safe mode. During fail-safe mode, the ECM cuts the current to
the throttle actuator off, and the throttle valve is returned to a 6° throttle angle by the return spring. The
ECM then adjusts the engine output by controlling the fuel injection (intermittent fuel-cut) and ignition
timing, in accordance with the accelerator pedal opening angle, to allow the vehicle to continue running at
a minimal speed. If the accelerator pedal is depressed gently, the vehicle can be driven slowly.
Fail-safe mode continues until a pass condition is detected, and the engine switch is then turned off.
