AC–233
AIR CONDITIONING – COMPRESSOR AND PULLEY (for 2AZ-FE)
Standard:
AC (Oil capacity inside the new compressor
and magnetic clutch: 160 + 15 cc (5.4 + 0.51
fl.oz.)) - (Remaining oil amount in the removed
compressor and magnetic clutch) = (Oil
amount to be removed from the new
compressor when replacing)
NOTICE:
• If a new compressor and magnetic clutch is
installed without removing some oil, due to
the oil remaining in the pipes of the vehicle,
the oil amount will be too large. This prevents
heat exchange in the refrigerant cycle and
causes refrigeration system failure.
• If the volume of oil remaining in the removed
compressor and magnetic clutch is too small,
check for oil leakage.
• Be sure to use ND-OIL 8 or equivalent for
compressor oil.
2. INSTALL COMPRESSOR AND PULLEY
