BE-148 BODY ELECTRICAL - SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM
(cid:3)FRONT PASSENGER OCCUPANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
1. General
The front passenger occupant classification system judges whether the front passenger seat is occupied by
an adult or child (with child seat) or is unoccupied, in accordance with the load that is applied to the front
passenger seat and whether the seat belt is buckled. Thus, it restricts the deployment of the front passenger
airbag, front passenger side airbag, and the front passenger seat belt pretensioner. In addition, the system
informs the driver of the result of the judgment through the use of the AIRBAG ON/OFF indicator lights.
(cid:1) This system consists of the occupant classification ECU, four occupant classification sensors, “AIRBAG
ON/OFF indicator lights”, seat belt buckle switch, and airbag sensor assembly.

Service Tip
(cid:1) When installing items to the front passenger seat or removing/installing the front passenger seat,
connect the hand-held tester and be sure to perform a system check and perform a zero-point
calibration of the sensor load value.
(cid:1) If performing maintenance due to the SRS warning light being on constantly or due to a collision,
in addition to the above item, check that the hand-held tester display value indicates within the range
of 30 kg (66 lb) +/- 3 kg (6.6 lb) when a 30 kg (66 lb) weight is placed on the front passenger seat.
