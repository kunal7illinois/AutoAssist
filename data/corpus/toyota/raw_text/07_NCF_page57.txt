EG-30 ENGINE - 2AZ-FE ENGINE
(cid:4)STARTING SYSTEM
1. General
(cid:3) A compact and lightweight PS (Planetary reduction-Segment conductor motor) starter is used on all
models.
(cid:3) The PS starter contains an armature that uses square-shaped conductors and its surface functions as a
commutator, resulting in improved output torque and overall length reduction.
(cid:3) In place of the field coil used in the conventional starter, the PS starter uses two types of permanent
magnets: main magnets and interpolar magnets. The main magnets and interpolar magnets have been
efficiently arranged to increase the magnetic flux and to shorten the length of the yoke.
