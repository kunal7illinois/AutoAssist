ES–345
2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Components Operations
(c) Leak detection
Creates negative pressure (vacuum) in EVAP system for leak check.
pump
Has opening with 0.02 inch diameter. Vacuum produced through orifice by closing purge VSV, turning off vent valve
(d) Reference orifice
and operating leak detection pump, to monitor reference pressure. Reference pressure indicates small leak of EVAP.
