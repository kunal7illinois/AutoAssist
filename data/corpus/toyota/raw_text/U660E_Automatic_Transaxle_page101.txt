DTC P0791 Intermediate Shaft Speed Sensor "A" Circuit
DTC P0793 Intermediate Shaft Speed Sensor "A"
DESCRIPTION
AX
This sensor detects the rotation speed of the turbine which shows the input speed of transaxle. By
comparing the input turbine speed signal (NC) with the counter gear speed sensor signal (NC), the TCM
detects the shift timing of the gears and appropriately controls the engine torque and hydraulic pressure
according to various conditions, thus, providing smooth gear shift.

DTC No. DTC Detection Condition Trouble Area
When the speed sensor input voltage is either more
P0791
than 1.9 V or less than 0.1 V for 2 seconds or more.
• Transmission revolution sensor (speed sensor NC)
When the vehicle speed is 15.5 mph (25 km/h) or • TCM
P0793 higher, the counter gear speed is less than 300 rpm for
2 seconds or more.
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The NT terminal of the TCM detects a revolution signal from the speed sensor (NT) (input RPM). The
TCM calculates a gearshift comparing the speed sensor (NT) with the speed sensor (NC).
While the vehicle is operating in 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th gear in the shift position of D, if the input shaft
revolution is less than 300 rpm *1although the output shaft revolution is more than 1,000 rpm *2, the TCM
interprets this as a fault, illuminates the MIL and stores the DTC.
*1: Pulse is not output or is irregularly output.
*2: The vehicle speed is 31 mph (50 km/h) or more.
