BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM (for ADVICS Made)
FREEZE FRAME DATA
1. FREEZE FRAME DATA
(a) Whenever an ABS DTC is detected, the skid control
ECU stores the current vehicle (sensor) state as
Freeze Frame Data.
The skid control ECU stores the number of times
(maximum: 31) the ignition switch has been turned
from off to on (IG) since the last time the ABS was
activated.
HINT:
• However, if the vehicle is stopped or at a low
speed (4.3 mph (7 km/h) or less), or if a DTC is
detected, the skid control ECU will stop counting
the number.
• Freeze Frame Data at the time the ABS
operates:
The skid control ECU stores and updates data
whenever the ABS system operates. BC
When the ECU stores data at the time a DTC is
detected, the data stored during ABS operation is
erased.
• Freeze Frame Data at the time a DTC is
detected:
When the skid control ECU stores data at the
time a DTC is detected, no updates will be
performed until the data is cleared.
(b) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(c) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(d) On the tester display, select the Freeze Frame Data.
