(7) Ground the spark plugs.
(8) Check if a spark occurs at each spark plug
while the engine is being cranked.
NOTICE:
• Be sure to ground the spark plugs when
checking.
• Replace the ignition coil if it receives an

NG Check that there is resistance
between ECM and VVT sensor. If
IG there is no resistance, replace VVT
sensor. If there is resistance, repair
wiring between VVT sensor and
ECM.
