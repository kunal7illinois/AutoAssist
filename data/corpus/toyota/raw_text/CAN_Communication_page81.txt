2 CHECK FOR SHORT IN CAN BUS WIRES (NO. 1 CAN J/C SIDE)
(a) Disconnect the CAN main bus wire white connector
No. 1 CAN J/C “A” Side (with Earth (E42) from the No. 1 CAN J/C "A" side (with earth
Terminal): terminal).

3 CHECK FOR SHORT IN CAN BUS WIRES (NO. 1 CAN J/C BRANCH WIRE)
(a) Reconnect the CAN main bus wire connector (E42) to
E10
DLC3: the No. 1 CAN J/C "A" side (with earth terminal).
CANH
(b) Connect the probes of an ohmmeter to terminals 6
(CANH) and 14 (CANL) of the DLC3.
(c) While observing the resistance value shown on the
tester, disconnect connectors E44, E45, E46 and E63
from the No. 1 CAN J/C one by one until the resistance
becomes normal (between 54 and 69 Ω).
