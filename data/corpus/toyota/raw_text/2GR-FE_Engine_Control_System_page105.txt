Advanced cam timing:
With warm engine and engine speed of between 500
rpm and 4,000 rpm, all conditions (a), (b) and (c) are
met • Valve timing
(2 trip detection logic): • Oil control valve (OCV) for exhaust camshaft (bank
P0014 (a) Difference between target and actual exhaust valve 1)
P0024 timing is more than 5°CA (Crankshaft Angle) for 4.5 • OCV filter (bank 1)
seconds • Exhaust camshaft
(b) Current exhaust valve timing is fixed (timing • ECM
changes less than 5°CA in 5 seconds)
(c) Variations in VVT controller timing are more than
19°CA of maximum delayed timing (advanced)
Retarded cam timing:

(b) Current exhaust valve timing is fixed (timing
changes less than 5°CA in 5 seconds)
(c) Variations in VVT controller timing are more than
19°CA or less of maximum delayed timing (retarded)
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
1. The ECM optimizes the exhaust valve timing using the VVT (Variable Valve Timing) system to control
the exhaust camshaft. The VVT system includes the ECM, the Oil Control Valve (OCV) and the VVT
controller.
