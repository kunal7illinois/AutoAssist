2GR-FE COOLING – COOLING FAN ECU
COOLING FAN ECU
ON-VEHICLE INSPECTION
1. INSPECT COOLING FAN ECU
1 2 3 (a) Inspect the input voltage.
(1) Disconnect the cooling fan ECU connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch on (IG). Check the
E1 SI +B1 voltage of the +B terminal of the disconnected
wire harness side connector.
A125060E02
Standard voltage:
9 to 14 V
If the result is not as specified, inspect the
power source system (fusible link, fuse, wire
harness and relay).
(b) Inspect the cooling fan motor (see page CO-15).
(c) Measure the resistance between terminals RFC
(ECM) and SI (cooling fan ECU) of the wire harness
side connectors.
HINT:
• If the fan does not operate, there may be a short
circuit.
• If the fan remains operating, there may be an
open circuit.
(d) Inspect the ECM power source circuit and ground
circuit.
