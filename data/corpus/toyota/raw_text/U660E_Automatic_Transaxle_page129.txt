AX–129
U660E AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE – AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE SYSTEM
2 PERFORM ACTIVE TEST BY INTELLIGENT TESTER (SHIFT SOLENOID VALVE SLT)
NOTICE:
• Perform the test at the normal operating ATF
(Automatic Transmission Fluid) temperature: 50 to AX
80°C (122 to 176°F)
• Be sure to prevent SST hose from interfering with the
exhaust pipe.
• This check must be conducted after checking and
adjusting the engine.
• Perform the test with the A/C OFF.
HINT:
Performing the ACTIVE TEST using the intelligent tester
allows relays, VSVs, actuators and other items to operate
without removing any parts. Performing the ACTIVE TEST as
the first step in troubleshooting is one method to save labor
time.
It is possible to display the DATA LIST during the ACTIVE
TEST.
(a) Turn the ignition switch off.
(b) Lift the vehicle up.
(c) Remove the test plug on the transmission case center
