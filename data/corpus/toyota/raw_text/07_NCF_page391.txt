NOTE:
(cid:1) The PlasmaclusterTM generator uses a high voltage, which is hazardous. Therefore, if the
PlasmaclusterTM generator requires repairs, be sure to have them done at a Toyota dealer.
(cid:1) Do not apply any type of spray (such as a cleaning solvent or hair spray) or stick any foreign matter into
the PlasmaclusterTM ion outlet, as this could cause improper operation or a malfunction.
(cid:1) After use, dust may accumulate around the side register on the driver seat side. If this occurs, press the
OFF switch on the heater control panel to stop the blower motor before cleaning the area.
(cid:1) It is normal for the PlasmaclusterTM generator to emit a slight sound during operation. This sound is
created when electrons collide with the electrode while PlasmaclusterTM ions are being generated.
