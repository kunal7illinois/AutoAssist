2GR-FE CHARGING – GENERATOR
INSPECTION
1. INSPECT GENERATOR CLUTCH PULLEY
Free Lock (a) Hold the center of the pulley, and confirm that the
outer ring turns counterclockwise and does not turn
clockwise.
If the result is not as specified, replace the clutch
pulley.

2. INSPECT GENERATOR BRUSH HOLDER ASSEMBLY
(a) Using vernier calipers, measure the length of the
exposed brushes.
Length Standard exposed length:
9.5 to 11.5 mm (0.374 to 0.453 in.)
Minimum exposed length:
4.5 mm (0.177 in.)
If the exposed length is less than the minimum,
replace the brush holder assembly.

3. INSPECT GENERATOR ROTOR ASSEMBLY
(a) Check that the generator rotor bearing is not rough
or worn.
If necessary, replace the generator rotor assembly.
A079306E02
(b) Check the generator rotor for an open circuit.
Slip Rings Ohmmeter
(1) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
between the slip rings.
Standard resistance
Condition Specified condition
Approx. 20°C (68°F) 2.3 to 2.7 Ω
If the result is not as specified, replace the
generator rotor assembly.

(c) Check the rotor for a short to ground.
Ohmmeter
(1) Using an ohmmeter, measure the resistance
between the slip ring and rotor.
Rotor Standard resistance
Tester condition Specified condition
CH Slip ring - Rotor 1 MΩ or higher
