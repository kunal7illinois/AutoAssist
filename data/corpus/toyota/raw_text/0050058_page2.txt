Vent valve turned OFF (vent) and EVAP system pressure measured by ECM in order to
Atmospheric pressure register atmospheric pressure.
A 10 seconds
measurement If pressure in EVAP system not between 76 kPa-a and 110 kPa-a (570 mmHg-a and 825
mmHg-a), ECM cancels EVAP system monitor.
In order to determine reference pressure, leak detection pump creates negative pressure
First reference

valve operate normally.
Vent valve turned ON (closed) to shut EVAP system.
Negative pressure (vacuum) created in EVAP system, and EVAP system pressure then
EVAP system pressure
C measured. 15 minutes*
measurement
Write down measured value as it will be used in leak check.
If EVAP pressure does not stabilize within 15 minutes, ECM cancels EVAP system monitor.
Purge VSV opened and then EVAP system pressure measured by ECM.
ES D Purge VSV monitor 10 seconds
Large increase indicates normality.
After second reference pressure measurement, leak check performed by comparing first and
Second reference second reference pressure.
E 60 seconds
pressure measurement If stabilized system pressure higher than second reference pressure, ECM determines that
EVAP system leaking.
F Final check Atmospheric pressure measured and then monitoring result recorded by ECM. -
*: If only a small amount of fuel is in the fuel tank, it takes longer for the EVAP pressure to stabilize.
