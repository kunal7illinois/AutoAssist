AUDIO / VISUAL – AUDIO AND VISUAL SYSTEM
(b) "Bluetooth" is a new wireless connection technology
that uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band. This makes
it possible to connect a cellular phone ("Bluetooth"
compatible phone *1) to the radio receiver (the
"Bluetooth" system is built in), and use the
handsfree function of the cellular phone, even if it is
in a pocket or bag. As a result, it is not necessary to
use a connector attached directly to the cellular
phone.
*1: Some versions of "Bluetooth" compatible cellular
phones may not function.
Example:
Radio Receiver
(Built-in “Bluetooth” receiver antenna)
Cellular Phone (”Bluetooth” type)
Cellular Tower

HINT:
The communication performance of "Bluetooth"
may vary depending on obstructions or radio wave
conditions between communication devices,
electromagnetic radiation, communication device
sensitivity, or antenna capacity. AV
