2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
The Air-Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor varies its output voltage in proportion to the air-fuel ratio. If the A/F sensor
impedance (alternating current resistance) or output voltage deviates greatly from the standard range, the
ECM determines that there is an open or short malfunction in the A/F sensor circuit.
