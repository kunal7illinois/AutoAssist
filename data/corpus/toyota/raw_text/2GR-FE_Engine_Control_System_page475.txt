ES–475
2GR-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
Air Intake Control Circuit
DESCRIPTION
The air cleaner is equipped with two inlets, one of which is opened or closed by the Air Intake Control
Valve (AICV). This system reduces intake noise and increases engine power at low-to-high engine
speeds range.
When the engine is operating in the low-to-mid speed range, this control operates the AICV to close one
of the air cleaner inlets. When the engine speed is more than 3,600 rpm and the opening angle of the
throttle valve is more than 60°, the ECM activates the VSV and opens the AICV.
