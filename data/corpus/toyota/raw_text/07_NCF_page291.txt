CHASSIS - BRAKE CH-127
2) Front Wheel Skid Restraining Control (Turn to the Right)
In the front wheel skid restraining control, the brakes of the front wheels and the rear wheel of the inner
circle of the turn are applied. Also, depending on whether the brake is ON or OFF and the condition of
the vehicle, there are circumstances in which the brake might not be applied to the wheels even if those
wheels are targeted for braking.
(cid:3) The diagram below shows the hydraulic circuit in the pressure increase mode, as it controls the front
wheel skid condition while the vehicle makes a right turn.
(cid:3) In other operating modes, the pressure holding valve and the pressure reduction valve are turned
ON/OFF according to the ABS with EBD operation pattern.
(cid:3) The front wheel skid restraining control is activated, each solenoid operates as shown in the table on
the next page.
