INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
According to the DATA LIST displayed by the intelligent tester, you can read the value of the switch,
sensor, actuator and so on without parts removal. Reading the DATA LIST as the first step of
troubleshooting is one method to shorten labor time.
NOTICE:
In the table below, the values listed under "Normal Condition" are reference values. Do not depend
solely on these reference values when deciding whether a part is faulty or not.
1. READ DATA LIST
(a) Turn the ignition switch off.
(b) Connect the intelligent tester together with the CAN VIM (controller area network vehicle
interface module) to the DLC3.
(c) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(d) Turn on the tester.
