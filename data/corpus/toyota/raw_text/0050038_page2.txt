Purge VSV opened and then EVAP system pressure measured by ECM.
D Purge VSV monitor 10 seconds
Large increase indicates normality.
After second reference pressure measurement, leak check performed by comparing first and
Second reference second reference pressure.
E 60 seconds
pressure measurement If stabilized system pressure higher than second reference pressure, ECM determines that
EVAP system leaking.
F Final check Atmospheric pressure measured and then monitoring result recorded by ECM. -
*: If only a small amount of fuel is in the fuel tank, it takes longer for the EVAP pressure to stabilize.

(a) P0455: EVAP gross leak
In operation C, the leak detection pump creates negative pressure (vacuum) in the EVAP system and the
EVAP system pressure is measured. If the stabilized system pressure is higher than [second reference
pressure x 0.2] (near atmospheric pressure), the ECM determines that the EVAP system has a large
leakage, illuminates the MIL and sets the DTC (2 trip detection logic).
