INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
Performing the ACTIVE TEST using the intelligent tester allows relays, VSVs, actuators and so on to
operate without removing any parts. Performing the ACTIVE TEST as the first step in troubleshooting is
one method to save labor time.
It is possible to display the DATA LIST during the ACTIVE TEST.
1. PERFORM ACTIVE TEST
(a) Warm up the engine.
(b) Turn the ignition switch off.
(c) Connect the intelligent tester to the DLC3.
(d) Turn the ignition switch on (IG).
(e) Turn the intelligent tester on.
(f) When using the intelligent tester:
