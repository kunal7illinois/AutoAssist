5. Clutch Pressure Control
Clutch to Clutch Pressure Control
(cid:3) This control is used for shifting from the 2nd to 3rd gear, and from the 3rd to 4th gear.
(cid:3) Solenoid valves actuate SL1, SL2, and SL3 in accordance with the signals from the ECM, and guide this
output pressure directly to the control valves B , C , and C in order to regulate the line pressure that acts

on the B brake, C and C clutches. As a result, compact B , C and C accumulators without a back

pressure chamber have been realized.

Line Pressure
Clutch Pressure Optimal Control
The ECM monitors the signals from various types of sensor such as the input turbine speed sensor, allowing
shift solenoid valves SL1, SL2, and SL3 to minutely control the clutch pressure in accordance with engine
output and driving conditions. As a result, smooth shift characteristics have been realized.
