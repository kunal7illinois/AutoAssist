INSPECTION PROCEDURE
HINT:
• If different DTCs that are related to a different system are output simultaneously while terminal E2 is
used as a ground terminal, terminal E2 may be open.
• Read freeze frame data using the intelligent tester. Freeze frame data records the engine conditions
when malfunctions are detected. When troubleshooting, freeze frame data can help determine if the
vehicle was running or stopped, if the engine was warmed up or not, if the air-fuel ratio was lean or
rich, and other data from the time the malfunction occurred.
