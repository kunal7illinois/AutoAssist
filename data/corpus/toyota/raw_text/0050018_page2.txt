2AZ-FE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM – SFI SYSTEM
HINT:
When any of these DTCs are set, check the air-flow rate by selecting the following menu items on the
intelligent tester: DIAGNOSIS / ENHANCED OBD II/ DATA LIST / PRIMARY / MAF.
Mass Air Flow Rate (g/sec.) Malfunctions
• Open in Mass Air Flow (MAF) meter power source circuit
Approximately 0.0
• Open or short in VG circuit
271.0 or more • Open in E2G circuit
MONITOR DESCRIPTION
If there is a defect in the MAF meter or an open or short circuit, the voltage level deviates from the normal
operating range. The ECM interprets this deviation as a malfunction in the MAF meter and sets a DTC.
Example:
ES
When the sensor output voltage remains less than 0.2 V, or more than 4.9 V, for more than 3 seconds, the
ECM sets a DTC.
If the malfunction is not repaired successfully, a DTC is set 3 seconds after the engine is next started.
