Speed-sensitive volume compensation (SVC)
Some audio systems are equipped with speed-sensitive volume compensation
(SVC). The navigation or audio unit receives the vehicle speed pulse (VSP) from
the ECM/PCM. The system processes the speed input and increases the navigation
or audio system volume level as the vehicle speed increases to compensate for the
various interior noises that occur at higher speeds. When the vehicle slows down,
the volume returns to its normal level. The SVC has four settings: SVC OFF, LOW,
MID and HIGH that can be adjusted using the navigation or audio unit. The SVC
comes from the factory with the MID setting as the default.
To change the audio unit SVC setting, press the tune folder sound knob repeatedly
until the SVC is displayed, rotate the knob to adjust the SVC to the desired setting
(SVC OFF, LOW, MID, or HIGH).
To change the navigation unit SVC setting, press the AUDIO button, and then
select the SOUND icon on the navigation display. Press the navigation display to
select the desired setting (OFF, LOW, MID, HI).
