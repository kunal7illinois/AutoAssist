valves in a valve body do not slide smoothly in their bores.
Use this procedure to free the valves.
1. Soak a sheet of #600 abrasive paper in ATF for about 30 minutes.
2. Carefully tap the valve body so the sticking valve drops out of its bore. It may
be necessary to use a small screwdriver to pry the valve free. Be careful not to
scratch the bore with the screwdriver.
3. Inspect the valve for any scuff marks. Use the ATF-soaked #600 paper to
polish off any burrs that are on the valve, then wash the valve in solvent and
dry it with compressed air.
4. Roll up half of the ATF-soaked #600 paper and insert it in the valve bore of the
sticking valve. Twist the paper slightly, so that it unrolls and fits the bore
tightly, then polish the bore by twisting the paper as you push it in and out.
NOTE: The valve body is aluminum and does not require much
polishing to remove any burrs.

5. Remove the #600 paper. Thoroughly wash the entire valve body in solvent,
then dry it with compressed air.
6. Coat the valve with ATF, then drop it into its bore. It should drop to the bottom
of the bore under its own weight. If not, repeat steps 4 and 5, then retest. If the
valve still sticks, replace the valve body.
