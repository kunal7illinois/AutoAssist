SAVE USERS MEMORY
When replacing the navigation unit, this function allows the dealer to transfer the
customer's personal data td the new navigation unit. The transferred information
includes their Setup settings, and personal addresses. The dealer inserts a PC card to
the navigation unit, and then selects the Save Users Memory function. The two
functions in this diagnostic screen are EXPORT and IMPORT. EXPORT saves the
customer's data to the PC card, and IMPORT moves the PC card files to the new
navigation unit.

Before starting this function, see the PC CARD FAQS for information regarding
PC cards, and the use of this function.
1. Select EXPORT button to move the customer's data from the original
navigation unit to the PC card. Select YES on the Export User Data
Confirmation screen. The process takes only a couple of seconds. The system
stores two files on the card.
NOTE: If the EXPORT button is grayed out, check the PC card's
edge connector, and the pins inside the navigation unit
(with a flashlight) for damage.
