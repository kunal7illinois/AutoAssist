2008 Honda Civic GX
2006-08 BRAKES Conventional Brake Components - Civic (Except Hybrid)
NOTE:
If the brake disc is beyond the service limit for
(cid:1)
refinishing, replace it (see KNUCKLE/HUB
REPLACEMENT ).
A new brake disc should be refinished if its runout
(cid:1)
is greater than 0.04 mm (0.0016 in.).
THICKNESS AND PARALLELISM
1. Raise the front of the vehicle, and support it with safety stands in the proper
locations (see LIFT AND SUPPORT POINTS ).
2. Remove the front wheels.
3. Remove the brake pads: Except Si model (see REPLACEMENT - EXCEPT
SI MODEL ), Si model (see REPLACEMENT - SI MODEL ).
4. Using a micrometer, measure the brake disc thickness at eight points, about 45°
apart and 10 mm (3/8 in.) in from the outer edge of the brake disc. Replace the
brake disc if the smallest measurement is less than the max. refinishing limit.
Brake disc thickness:
Standard:
Except Si model: 20.9-21.1 mm (0.82-0.83 in.)
Si model: 24.9-25.1 mm (0.98-0.99 in.)
Max. refinishing limit:
Except Si model: 19.0 mm (0.75 in.)
Si model: 23.0 mm (0.91 in.)
Brake disc parallelism: 0.015 mm (0.0006 in.) max.
NOTE: This is the maximum allowable difference between the
thickness measurements.
