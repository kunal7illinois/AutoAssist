EBD Features
The electronic brake distribution (EBD) feature helps control vehicle braking by
adjusting the rear brake force in accordance with the rear wheel load before the
ABS operates. Based on the wheel speed sensor signals, the control unit uses the
modulator to control the rear brakes individually. When the rear wheel speed is less
than the front wheel speed, the VSA modulator-control unit retains the current rear
brake fluid pressure by closing the inlet valve in the modulator. As the rear wheel
speed increases and approaches the front wheel speed, the VSA modulator-control
unit increases the rear brake fluid pressure by momentarily opening the inlet valve.
This whole process is repeated very rapidly. While this is happening, there is
kickback at the brake pedal.
