Main Bearing Clearance Inspection
1. To check the main bearing-to-journal oil clearance, remove the lower block
and bearing halves (see CRANKSHAFT AND PISTON REMOVAL ).
2. Clean each main journal and bearing half with a clean shop towel.
3. Place one strip of plastigage across each main journal.
4. Reinstall the bearings and lower block, then torque the bolts to 25 N-m (2.5
kgf-m, 18 lbf-ft) + 57 degrees in the proper sequence (see step 19 ).
NOTE: Do not rotate the crankshaft during inspection.
5. Remove the lower block and bearings again, and measure the widest part of the
plastigage.
