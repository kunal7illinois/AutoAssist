buildings, will block satellites in that direction. That is why it is necessary to be in
an open area to effectively troubleshoot GPS reception issues. The satellites shown
on the diagram correspond to the PRN number in the GPS Details screen. There are
always 24 active GPS satellites in orbit. Because satellites fail, and have to be
removed from service, spares are always parked in orbit, ready to be activated. This
is why the PRN (satellite ID number) can be greater than 24.
NOTE:
To use this screen for troubleshooting, the vehicle
(cid:1)
should be outside, away from buildings, tall trees, and
high-tension wires for at least 10 minutes with the
engine running.
Metallic window tinting on the front or side window or
(cid:1)
after-market electronic accessories mounted near the
navigation unit, GPS antenna, or navigation display can
interfere with GPS acquisition.
The Number of Satellites box shows the number of
(cid:1)
acquired satellites (maximum of 12). It should contain 4
or more icons. If not, troubleshoot for GPS icon is white
or not shown (see GPS ICON IS WHITE OR NOT
SHOWN).
The Current Position shows latitude, longitude, and
(cid:1)
elevation (in meters). If there are less than 4 satellites,
the elevation can be grossly inaccurate.
The Date/Time field shows the current date, and also a
(cid:1)
time that includes daylight savings and other offsets
entered by the customer in Setup function Adjust Time
Zone/Clock.
