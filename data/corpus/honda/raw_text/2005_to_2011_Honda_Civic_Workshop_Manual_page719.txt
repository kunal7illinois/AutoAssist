D Position: Shifting between 4th gear and 5th gear
As the speed of the vehicle reaches the programmed value, the PCM turns shift
solenoid valve A OFF while shift solenoid valve B and C remain ON. As a result,
the pressure in the right end of shift valve A is released. Even though shift solenoid
valve A pressure (SA) is released, cut valve A is kept on the right side by the line
pressure (4). Shift valve A is moved to the right side to uncover A/T clutch pressure
control solenoid valve C pressure (5T) (5J) port leading to the 4th clutch. The 4th
and 5th clutches are engaged by the A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve
pressure mode.
NOTE: When used, "left" or "right" indicates direction on the
hydraulic circuit.
