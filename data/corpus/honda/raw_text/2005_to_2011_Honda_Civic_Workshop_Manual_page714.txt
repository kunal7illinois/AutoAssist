The PCM turns shift solenoid valve B OFF, shift solenoid valve A remains ON, and
C remains OFF. Shift solenoid valve B is turned OFF, and shift solenoid valve B
pressure (SB) in the right end of shift valve B and in the left end of the servo
control valve is released. Cut valve B and servo control valve are kept in the right
side by line pressure (4) even though releasing hydraulic pressure in the left end.
Shift valve B is moved to the right side to switch A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valve B pressure (5F) port to line pressure (5D) port leading to the 2nd
clutch. 2nd clutch pressure (20) is applied to the 2nd clutch, and the 2nd clutch is
engaged by the line pressure mode.
