Airbags
The SRS is a safety device which, when used with the seat belt, is designed to help
protect the driver and front passenger in a frontal impact exceeding a certain set
limit. The system consists of the SRS unit, including safing sensor and impact
sensor (A), the cable reel (B), the driver's airbag (C), the front passenger's airbag
(D), side airbags (E), side curtain airbags (F), seat belt tensioners (G), seat belt
buckle tensioners (H), side impact sensors (first) (I), front impact sensors (J), rear
safing sensor (K) and side impact sensors (second) (L).

SRS unit determines whether or not the airbags will deploy. In such cases, the seat
belt will provide sufficient protection, and the supplemental protection offered by
