Is there continuity?
YES -Repair short to body ground in the wire between the reverse lockout
solenoid and the ECM (A27).
NO -Update the ECM if it does not have the latest software (see UPDATING
THE ECM ), or substitute a known-good ECM (see SUBSTITUTING THE
ECM ), then recheck. If the symptom/indication goes away with a known-good
ECM, replace the original ECM (see ECM REPLACEMENT ).
REVERSE LOCKOUT SOLENOID TEST
1. Remove the reverse lockout solenoid (see REVERSE LOCKOUT
SOLENOID TEST ).
2. Connect battery positive terminal to the reverse lockout solenoid 2P connector
No. 2 terminal, and connect the battery negative terminal to the No. 1 terminal.
