D Position: 1st gear shifting from the N position
The shift solenoid valves and the shift valves remain the same position when
shifting from D to N. The PCM actuates A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve
A to regulate the line pressure. Line pressure (1) becomes A/T clutch pressure
control solenoid valve A pressure (55), and A/T clutch pressure control solenoid
valve A pressure flows to the lock-up shift valve, shift valve B, the manual valve,
and shift valve A. Also solenoid valve A pressure becomes 1st clutch pressure (10)
at shift valve C, and 1st clutch pressure (10) flows to the 1st clutch. The 1st clutch
is engaged by A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A pressure mode when
shifting to D from N.
