Reservoir Union
BRAKE BOOSTER TEST
FUNCTIONAL TEST
1. With the engine stopped, press the brake pedal several times to deplete the
vacuum reservoir, then press the brake pedal hard, and hold it for 15 seconds.
If the brake pedal sinks, either the master cylinder is bypassing internally, or
the brake system is leaking. Inspect the brake hoses and lines (see BRAKE
HOSE AND LINE INSPECTION ).
2. Start the engine with the brake pedal pressed. If the brake pedal sinks slightly,
the vacuum booster is operating normally. If the brake pedal height does not
vary, do the leak test.
3. Do the brake system test (see BRAKE SYSTEM INSPECTION AND
TEST ).
LEAK TEST
1. Press the brake pedal with the engine running, then stop the engine. If the
brake pedal height does not vary while pressed for 30 seconds, the vacuum
booster is OK. If the pedal height rises go to step 6. If it does not rise go to step
2.
2. Start the engine and let it idle for 30 seconds. Turn the ignition switch off, and
wait 30 seconds. Press the brake pedal several times using normal pressure.
When the pedal is first pressed, it should be low. On consecutive applications,
the pedal height should gradually rise. Does the pedal rise on each consecutive
application? If it rises the booster is OK. If it does not go to step 3.
3. Disconnect the brake booster vacuum hose (A) at the booster. The check valve
is built into the hose.
