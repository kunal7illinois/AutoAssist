valve B, and becomes line pressure (5A) at the manual valve. Line pressure (5A)
passes through shift valve A, flows to shift valve C, and becomes 1st clutch
pressure (10). 1st clutch pressure (10) is applied to the 1st clutch, and the 1st clutch
is engaged.

R Position: Shifting to the R position from the P or N position
The manual valve is moved into the R position. This causes line pressure (1) to

solenoid valves C and D ON, and shift solenoid valves A and B remain OFF. Shift
solenoid valve D pressure (SD) is applied to the left end of shift valve D, causing
shift valve D to move to the right side, uncovering the line pressure (3) port leading
