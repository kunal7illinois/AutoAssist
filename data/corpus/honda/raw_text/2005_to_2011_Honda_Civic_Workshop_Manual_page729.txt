No Lock-up
The PCM turns shift solenoid valve D OFF. The lock-up shift valve is on the right
side, and uncovers the torque converter pressure port leading to the back of the
torque converter. Torque converter pressure (92) regulated by the regulator valve
flows to the lock-up shift valve, and becomes torque converter pressure (94).
Torque converter pressure (94) enters into the back of the torque converter, and
discharges into the circuit from the front of the torque converter. When the
hydraulic pressure flow enters the torque converter from the rear and discharges it
from the front, the torque converter clutch piston and cover become disengaged.
This is called the non lock-up condition.
NOTE: When used, "left" or "right" indicates direction on the
hydraulic circuit.
