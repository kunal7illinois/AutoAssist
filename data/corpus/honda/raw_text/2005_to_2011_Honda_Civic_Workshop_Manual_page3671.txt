YAW RATE TUNING
This diagnostic allows you to graphically display problems with the yaw rate
sensor.
The ANG-Disp value accumulates any differences between the offset, and
(cid:1)
sensor voltages (see Yaw Rate diagnostic). When the sensor is healthy, the
random changes in these two voltages generally cancels out, so the value is 0.
However if one voltage is consistently higher than the other, then the ANG-
Disp value accumulates the constant change.
The Reset button temporarily clears the angular accumulation (ANG-Disp),
(cid:1)
and clears the display dots.
Do not touch the CCW or CW, or Set buttons. These are used for factory setup
(cid:1)
only.
For serious problems with the sensor, the stationary test usually confirms whether
the sensor is defective. For yaw rate issues related to driving, perform the road test
described below.
1. Stationary test: If the-VP icon spins in place and the ANG-Disp value slowly
increases or decreases in value, the yaw rate sensor is defective. Replace the
Navigation unit.
2. Road test: Drive the vehicle on a very straight road. Enter the diagnostic mode,
select Yaw rate, and touch the Tuning button. While driving down a straight
road, the white dots should trace a straight line across the screen. However, if
you are driving on a straight road, and you notice the dots constantly dropping
down or heading up as you drive, the navigation unit's yaw sensor is defective.
