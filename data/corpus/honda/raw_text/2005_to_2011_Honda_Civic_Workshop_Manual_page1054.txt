5. Make sure the selector control shaft is in the N position. If necessary, move the
shift lever to the N position from the P position.
NOTE: Do not use the selector control shaft to adjust the shift
position. If the selector control shaft tips are squeezed
together it will cause a faulty signal or position due to
play between the selector control shaft and switch.
