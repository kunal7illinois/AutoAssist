GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION
EPS INDICATOR
Under normal conditions, the EPS indicator comes on when the ignition switch is
turned to the ON (II) position, then goes off after the engine is started. This
indicates that the LED and its circuit are operating correctly. If there is a failure in
the system after the engine is started, the EPS indicator will stay on, and the power
assist is turned off.
When the EPS indicator comes on, the control unit memorizes the DTC. In this
case, the control unit will not activate the EPS system after the engine starts again,
but it keeps the EPS indicator on.
When DTC 51-01, 51-02 or 51-06 is stored in the control unit, the EPS indicator
will stay on until the DTC is erased. When a problem is detected and the EPS
indicator comes on, there are cases when the indicator stays on until the ignition
switch is turned OFF, and cases when the indicator goes off automatically when the
system returns to normal. Even though the system is operating normally, the EPS
indicator will come on under the following conditions:
The vehicle speed decreases abruptly from 12mph (20 km/h) or more (by
(cid:1)
applying brake), and it is less than 1 mph (1 km/h) and engine speed is 2,000
rpm or above for 5 seconds (continuously) after the abrupt deceleration.
While turning the steering wheel with the vehicle speed of 1 mph (1 km/h) or
(cid:1)
less for 20 seconds, and the engine speed is 2,000 rpm or above for at least 10
seconds.
When the engine speed is 500 rpm or less, and the vehicle is travelling at a
(cid:1)
speed of 6 mph (10 km/h) or more for about 3 seconds.
To determine the actual cause of the problem, question the customer about the
conditions during which the problem occured, taking the above conditions into
consideration.
