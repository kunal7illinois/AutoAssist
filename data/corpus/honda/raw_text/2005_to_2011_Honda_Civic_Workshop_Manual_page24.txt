The control unit detects the wheel speed based on the wheel sensor signals it
received, then it calculates the vehicle speed based on the detected wheel speed.
The control unit detects the vehicle speed during deceleration based on the rate of
deceleration.
The control unit calculates the slip rate of each wheel, and transmits the control
signal to the modulator unit solenoid valve when the slip rate is high.
The hydraulic control has three modes: Pressure intensifying, pressure reducing,
and pressure retaining.
