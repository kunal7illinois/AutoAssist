1. Connect the Honda Diagnostic System (HDS) to the data link connector (DLC)
(see GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION ).
2. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
3. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the engine control
module (ECM). If it doesn't, troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC
CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
4. Go to PGM-FI, and check for DTCs (see DTC TROUBLESHOOTING
INDEX .
5. Do the following tests while monitoring parameters in the PGM-FI DATA
LIST with the HDS.
NOTE: Intermittent failures are often caused by loose circuit
connections. While monitoring cruise control inputs,
flex their circuits, and note if any of the test results
change.
