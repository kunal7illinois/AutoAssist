STEERING WHEEL INSTALLATION
1. Before installing the steering wheel, make sure the front wheels are aligned
straight ahead, then center the cable reel (A). Do this by first rotating the cable
reel clockwise until it stops. Then rotate it counterclockwise about three full
turns. The arrow mark (B) on the cable reel label should point straight up.
