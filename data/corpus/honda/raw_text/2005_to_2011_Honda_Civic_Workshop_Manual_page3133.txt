2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 ENGINE Ignition System (R18A1) - Civic (All Except Hybrid)
1. Connect the Honda Diagnostic System (HDS) to the data link connector (DLC)
(see step 2 on HOW TO USE THE HDS (HONDA DIAGNOSTIC
SYSTEM) ).
2. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
3. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the ECM/PCM. If it
doesn't, troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT
TROUBLESHOOTING ).
4. Check for DTCs (see GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING
INFORMATION ). If a DTC is present, diagnose and repair the cause before
continuing with this test.
5. Start the engine. Hold the engine speed at 3,000 rpm without load (in the P or
N position (A/T) or neutral (M/T)) until the radiator fan comes on, then let it
idle.
6. Check the idle speed (see IDLE SPEED INSPECTION ).
7. Jump the SCS line with the HDS.
8. Connect the timing light to the No. 1 ignition coil harness.
9. Aim the light toward the pointer (A) on the cam chain case. Check the ignition
timing under a no load condition (headlights, blower fan, rear window
defogger, and air conditioner are turned off).
