Automatic Transmission Gear Position Indicator
The A/T gear position indicator in the gauge control module shows which shift
lever position has been selected without having look down at the shift lever.
Clutches and Gears
The five-speed automatic transmission uses hydraulically-actuated clutches to
engage or disengage the transmission gears. When hydraulic pressure is introduced
into the clutch drum, the clutch piston moves. This presses the friction discs and the
steel plates together, locking them so they do not slip. Power is then transmitted
through the engaged clutch pack to its hub-mounted gear. Likewise, when the
hydraulic pressure is bled from the clutch pack, the piston releases the friction discs
and the steel plates, and they are free to slide past each other. This allows the gear
to spin independently on its shaft, transmitting no power.
