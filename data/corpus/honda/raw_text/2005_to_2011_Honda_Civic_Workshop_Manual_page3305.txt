Shifting to 5th gear or reverse gear
When the shift lever is moved to the 5th gear-reverse plane, the shift piece pushes
and turns the reverse lock cam. When the shift lever is shifted to 5th gear or reverse,
the shift fork moves and completes the gear change. When the shift to 5th gear or
reverse is completed, the reverse lock cam is turned back to a neutral position by
the return spring.
