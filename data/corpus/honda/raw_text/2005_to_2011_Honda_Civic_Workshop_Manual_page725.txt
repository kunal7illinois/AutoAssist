2008 Honda Civic LX
2006-08 TRANSMISSION Automatic Transmission - Civic (Except Hybrid)
When starting off in reverse gear, the PCM turns shift solenoid valves B and C ON.
Shift solenoid valve A remains OFF, and D remains ON. Shift solenoid valve B is
turned ON, and shift solenoid valve B pressure (SB) is applied to the right end of
shift valve B. Shift valve B is moved to the right side to switch A/T clutch pressure
control solenoid valve A pressure (55') port to line pressure (1B) port leading to the
5th clutch. The 5th clutch is engaged with the line pressure mode.
Reverse Inhibitor Control
When R is selected while the vehicle is moving forward at speeds over 6 mph (10
km/h), the PCM turns shift solenoid valves A and C ON, and shift solenoid valves
B and D OFF. Shift solenoid valve D is kept OFF, and shift valve D is kept in the
left side to cover line pressure (3) port leading to the servo valve. The servo valve is
kept in the forward position. Shift solenoid valve A is turned ON, shift valve A is
moved to the right side and covers the port to stop line pressure (1 A) leading to the
5th clutch. The servo valve is not applied line pressure, the 5th clutch is not applied
5th clutch pressure, as a result, power is not transmitted to the reverse direction.
NOTE: When used, "left" or "right" indicates direction on the
hydraulic circuit.
