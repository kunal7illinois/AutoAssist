17. Check for Temporary DTCs or DTCs with the HDS.
Is DTC P0401 indicated?
YES - Check for poor connections or loose terminals at the EGR valve and the
ECM/PCM. If the ECM/PCM was updated, substitute a known-good
ECM/PCM (see SUBSTITUTING THE ECM/PCM ), then go to step 16. If
the ECM/PCM was substituted, go to step 1.

Does the screen indicate PASSED?
YES - If the ECM/PCM was updated, troubleshooting is complete. If the
ECM/PCM was substituted, replace the original ECM/PCM (see ECM/PCM
REPLACEMENT ). If any other Temporary DTCs or DTCs were indicated in
step 17, go to the indicated DTCs troubleshooting.
NO - If the screen indicates FAILED, check for poor connections or loose
terminals at the EGR valve and the ECM/PCM. If the ECM/PCM was updated,
substitute a known-good ECM/PCM (see SUBSTITUTING THE
ECM/PCM ), then go to step 16. If the ECM/PCM was substituted, go to step
1. If the screen indicates EXECUTING, keep driving until a result comes on. If
the screen indicates OUT OF CONDITION, go to step 16.
