2008 Honda Civic LX
2006-08 TRANSMISSION Automatic Transmission - Civic (Except Hybrid)
Full Lock-up
When the vehicle speed increases, the PCM controls A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valve A to increase A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A pressure
(55). A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A pressure (55) is applied to the
lock-up control valve, and the lock-up control valve is moved to the left side to
release torque converter back pressure (94). Torque converter pressure (91) enters
into the front of the torque converter, and the torque converter clutch piston is
engaged with the torque converter cover securely by torque converter pressure.
Under this condition, torque converter back pressure is released fully, causing the
torque converter clutch to be fully engaged; this condition is full lock-up.
NOTE: When used, "left" or "right" indicates direction on the
hydraulic circuit.
