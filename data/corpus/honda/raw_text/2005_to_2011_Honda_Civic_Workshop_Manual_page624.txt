3. Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), and disconnect the HDS from the DLC.

operating temperature (the radiator fan comes on).

Updating the PCM
Special Tools Required
Honda diagnostic system (HDS) tablet tester
(cid:1)
Honda interface module (HIM) and an iN workstation with HDS and CM
(cid:1)
update software
HDS pocket tester
(cid:1)
GNA600 and an iN workstation with HDS and CM update software
(cid:1)
NOTE:
Use this procedure when you need to update the PCM
(cid:1)
during troubleshooting procedures.
Make sure HDS/HIM has the latest software version
(cid:1)
downloaded from the iN (interactive network).
To ensure the latest program is installed, do a PCM
(cid:1)
update whenever the PCM is substituted or replaced.
You cannot update a PCM with the program it already
(cid:1)
has. It will only accept a new program.
Before you update the PCM, make sure the battery is
(cid:1)
fully charged, and connect a jumper battery (not a
battery charger) to maintain system voltage.
Never turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0) while
(cid:1)
updating the PCM. If you turn the ignition switch to
LOCK (0) before completion, the PCM can be damaged.
