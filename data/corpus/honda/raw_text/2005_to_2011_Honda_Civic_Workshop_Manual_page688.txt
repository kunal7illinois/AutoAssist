Grade Logic Control: Ascending Control
When the PCM determines that the vehicle is climbing a hill in D, the PCM extends
the engagement area of 2nd gear, 3rd gear, and 4th gear to prevent the transmission
from frequently shifting between 2nd and 3rd gears, between 3rd and 4th gears, and
between 4th and 5th gears, so the vehicle can run smooth and have more power
when needed.
NOTE: Shift commands stored in the PCM between 2nd and 3rd
gears, between 3rd and 4th gears, and between 4th and 5th
gears, enable the PCM to automatically select the most
suitable gear according to the magnitude of a gradient.
