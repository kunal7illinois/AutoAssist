17. Place the steering gearbox in a press, then remove the cylinder end seal (A) and
backup ring (B) from the steering gearbox by pressing on the 24 "long, 3/8"
drive extension.
Note these items when pressing the cylinder end seal:
Keep the tool straight to avoid damaging the cylinder wall. Check the tool
(cid:1)
angle, and correct it if necessary, when removing the cylinder end seal.
Use a press to remove the cylinder end seal. Do not try to remove the seal
(cid:1)
by striking the tool; striking the tool would break the backup ring, and the
cylinder end seal would remain in the steering gearbox.
