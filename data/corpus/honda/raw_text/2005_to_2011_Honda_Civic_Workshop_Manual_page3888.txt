2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 ACCESSORIES & EQUIPMENT Power Windows - Civic (All Except Hybrid)
The system is composed of the power window master switch and the driver's power
window motor.
The driver's power window motor incorporates a pulser which generates pulses
during the motor's operation and sends the pulses to the driver's power window
control unit. As soon as the power window control unit detects no pulses from the
pulser, the driver's power window control unit makes the power window motor stop
and reverse. If the window is more than halfway closed, it will reverse to half open
position. If the window is less than halfway closed, it will stop and reverse about 2
inches. This is to prevent pinching an obstacle during auto-up operation. The auto
reverse operation is not active when the switch is held in the up position.
