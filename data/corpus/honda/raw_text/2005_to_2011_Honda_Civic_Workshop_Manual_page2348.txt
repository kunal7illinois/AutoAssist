CYLINDER BORE HONING
Only a scored or scratched cylinder bore must be honed.
1. Measure the cylinder bores (see BLOCK AND PISTON INSPECTION ). If
the engine block is to be reused, hone the cylinders, and remeasure the bores.
2. Hone the cylinder bores with honing oil and a fine (400 grit) stone in a 60
degree cross-hatch pattern (A). Use only a rigid hone with 400 grit or finer
stone such as Sunnen, Ammco, or equivalent. Do not use stones that are worn
or broken.

3. When honing is complete, thoroughly clean the engine block of all metal
particles. Wash the cylinder bores with hot soapy water, then dry and oil them
