SRS components are located in this area. Review the SRS component locations (see
COMPONENT LOCATION INDEX ) and the precautions and procedures (see
PRECAUTIONS AND PROCEDURES ) in the SRS before doing repairs or
service.
NOTE:
Follow the C-pillar trim installation procedure carefully;
(cid:1)
improper installation could cause the side curtain
airbag to deploy improperly and possibly cause injury.
Put on gloves to protect your hands.
(cid:1)
Use the appropriate tool from the KTC trim tool set to
(cid:1)
avoid damage when prying components.
Take care not to scratch the trim and panels.
(cid:1)
The front clip in the C-pillar trim (A) consists of a
(cid:1)
grommet (B) and a pin (C). The grommet expanded with
the pin secures it to the body panel (D). The projections
(E) on the pin is broken during removal, so the clip
must be replaced with a new one when the trim is
reinstalled.
