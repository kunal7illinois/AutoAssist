FREQUENCY SWEEP
Do this test to find rattles or reverberation that may cause a perception of poor
sound quality.
1. Insert the audio diagnostic CD (T/N: 07AAZ-SDBA100) into the navigation
unit or audio unit.
2. Play track No. 13 (sweep from 500 Hz to 35 Hz) at a normal, or slightly higher
than normal, volume level.
3. Listen to each speaker for poor sound quality or reverberations caused by

channel with the problem.
If vibrations or poor sound quality are heard, go to step 4.
