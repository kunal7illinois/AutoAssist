turn 1/4 turn after it's tight, then it clicks.
Is the correct fuel fill cap installed and properly tightened?
YES - Go to step 2.
NO - Replace or tighten the cap, then go to step 19.
2. Check the fuel fill cap seal (A) and the fuel fill pipe mating surface (B). Verify
that the fuel fill cap tether cord (C) is not caught under the cap.
