As the speed of the vehicle reaches the programmed value, the PCM turns shift
solenoid valve A OFF, while shift solenoid valve B and C remain OFF. Shift
solenoid valve A is turned OFF, and shift solenoid valve A pressure (SA) in the
right end of shift valve A and in the left end of cut valve A is released. Even though
shift solenoid valve A pressure is released, cut valve A is kept on the right side by
line pressure (4). Shift valve A is moved to the right side to switch to the line
pressure (5G) port to the A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve B pressure (5E)
port leading to the 2nd clutch. Also shift valve A uncovers 3rd clutch pressure (30)
port leading A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve C pressure (5L) to the 3rd
