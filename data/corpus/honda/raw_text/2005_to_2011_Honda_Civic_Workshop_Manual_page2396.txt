2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 ENGINE PERFORMANCE EVAP System (K20Z3) - Civic (Except GX & Si)
YES - If the ECM was updated, troubleshooting is complete. If the ECM was
substituted, replace the original ECM (see ECM REPLACEMENT ). If any
other Temporary DTCs or DTCs were indicated in step 37, go to the indicated
DTC's troubleshooting.
NO - If the screen indicates FAILED, check for poor connections or loose
terminals at the FTP sensor and the ECM. If the ECM was updated, substitute a
known-good ECM (see SUBSTITUTING THE ECM ), then go to step 36. If
the ECM was substituted, go to step 1. If the screen indicates NOT
COMPLETED, keep idling until a result comes on.
DTC P0455: EVAP SYSTEM LARGE LEAK DETECTED; DTC P0456: EVAP SYSTEM VERY
SMALL LEAK DETECTED
NOTE: The fuel system is designed to allow specified maximum
vacuum and pressure conditions. Do not deviate from the
vacuum and pressure tests as indicated in these
procedures. Excessive pressure/vacuum would damage the
EVAP components or cause eventual fuel tank failure.
Special Tools Required
Vacuum pump/gauge, 0-30 in.Hg, Snap-on YA4000A or equivalent, commercially
available
NOTE:
Before you troubleshoot, record all freeze data and any
(cid:1)
on-board snapshot, and review the general
troubleshooting information (see GENERAL
TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION ).
Fresh fuel has a higher volatility that will create greater
(cid:1)
pressure/vacuum. The optimum condition for testing is
less than a full tank of fresh fuel. If possible, to assist in
leak detection, add 1 gallon of fresh fuel to the tank (as
long as it will not fill the tank), just before starting these
procedures.
