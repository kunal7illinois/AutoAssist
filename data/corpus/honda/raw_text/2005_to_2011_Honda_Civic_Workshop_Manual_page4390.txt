2008 Honda Civic GX
2006-08 BRAKES VSA System - Civic (All Except Hybrid)
ABS indicator or VSA indicator does not go off, and no DTCs are stored
1. Check for the communication between the vehicle and the HDS.
Is there the communication?
YES -Check for loose terminals in the gauge control module (tach) 36P
connector. If necessary, substitute a known-good gauge control module (tach),
then recheck. If it is OK, replace the original gauge control module (tach) (see
REPLACEMENT ).
NO -If the HDS does not communicate with all the system of the vehicle,
troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
If the HDS does not communicate with only VSA, go to step 2.
2. Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0).
3. Check the No. 4 (7.5 A) fuse in the under-dash fuse/ relay box.
Is the fuse blown?
YES -Install the new No. 4 (7.5 A) fuse, and recheck. If the fuse continues to
blow, check for short to body ground in the wire between the No. 4 (7.5 A)
fuse in the under-dash fuse/relay box and the VSA modulator-control unit. If
necessary, substitute a known-good VSA modulator-control unit (see VSA
MODULATOR-CONTROL UNIT REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION ),
and retest.
NO -Reinstall the checked fuse, then go to step 4.
4. Disconnect the VSA modulator-control unit 37P connector.
5. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
6. Measure voltage between VSA modulator-control unit 37P terminal No. 28 and
body ground.
