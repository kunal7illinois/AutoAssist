If the pump does not run, do the fuel pump circuit troubleshooting (see
(cid:1)

5. Read the fuel pressure gauge. The pressure should be 380-430 kPa (3.9-4.4
2
kgf/cm , 55-63 psi).

If the pressure is out of specification, replace the fuel pressure regulator
(cid:1)
(see FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR REPLACEMENT ) and the
fuel filter (see FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR REPLACEMENT ),
then recheck the fuel pressure.
