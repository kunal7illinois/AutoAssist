RECIRCULATION CONTROL MOTOR TEST
NOTE: Before testing, check for HVAC DTCs (see HOW TO USE
THE SELF-DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTION ).
1. Disconnect the 7P connector from the recirculation control motor.
NOTE: Incorrectly applying power and ground to the
recirculation control motor will damage it. Follow the
instructions carefully.
2. Connect battery power to the No. 1 terminal of the recirculation control motor,
and ground the No. 5 and No. 7 terminals; the recirculation control motor
should run smoothly. To avoid damaging the recirculation control motor, do
not reverse power and ground. Disconnect the No. 5 or No. 7 terminals from
ground; the recirculation control motor should stop at Fresh (when the No. 5
terminal is disconnected) or Recirculate (when the No. 7 terminal is
disconnected). Don't cycle the recirculation control motor for a long time.
