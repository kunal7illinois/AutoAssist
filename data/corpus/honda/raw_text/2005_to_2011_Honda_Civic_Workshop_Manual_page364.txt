2. Turn the ignition switch ON (II), and check that the SRS indicator comes on
for about 6 seconds and then goes off.
Does the SRS indicator stay on, and is DTC 86-1x or 86-2x indicated?
YES -Go to step 3.
NO -Intermittent failure, system is OK at this time. Go to
TROUBLESHOOTING INTERMITTENT FAILURES. If another DTC is

NOTE: After market devices (fluorescent lights, laptop
computers, etc.) used near the front passenger's seat-

cause a false DTC 86-1x or 86-2x. If one of these
devices was used, clear the DTC, operate the device
near the seat-back, and recheck for DTCs. If DTC 86-1x
or 86-2x is set, clear it, and do not use the device near
the seat-back.
