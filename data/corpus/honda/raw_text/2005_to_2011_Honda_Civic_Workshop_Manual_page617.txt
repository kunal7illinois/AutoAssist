If the D indicator or the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) has been reported on, or
if a driveability problem is suspected, do this:
1. Connect the HDS to the DLC. (See the HDS user's manual for specific
instructions.)
2. Turn the ignition switch to ON (II). Make sure the HDS communicates with
the PCM. If it does not, go to the DLC circuit troubleshooting (see DLC
CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
3. Select A/T system, and observe the DTC in the DTCs MENU on the HDS
screen.
4. Record the freeze data and on-board snapshots for all fuel and emissions DTCs
and A/T DTCs.
5. If there is a fuel and emissions DTC, first check the fuel and emissions system
as indicated by the DTC.
6. Clear the DTC and data.
7. Drive the vehicle for several minutes under the same conditions as those
indicated by the freeze data, and then recheck for a DTC. If the A/T DTC
returns, go to the INDICATED DTC'S TROUBLESHOOTING. If the DTC
does not return, there was an intermittent problem within the circuit. Make sure
all pins and terminals in the circuit are tight.
Symptom Troubleshooting Versus DTC Troubleshooting
Some symptoms will not trigger diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) or cause the D
indicator to blink. If the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) was reported on or the D
indicator has been blinking, check for DTCs. If the vehicle has an abnormal
symptom, and there are no DTCs stored, do the symptom troubleshooting. Check
the list of probable cause(s) for the symptom, in the sequence listed, until you find
the problem.
