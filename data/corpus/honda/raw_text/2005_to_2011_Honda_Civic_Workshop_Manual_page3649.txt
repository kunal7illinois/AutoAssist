power circuit. A feedback can cause this problem.
1. Remove the key from the ignition.
Does the navigation screen stay on?
YES -Go to step 2.
NO -The system is OK at this time.
2. The vehicle may have been used as a demonstration vehicle at an event like an
auto show. In these events, power is often jumpered to the navigation system
so that the ignition key is not needed in the vehicle. At the end of the show, the
jumper wire may not have been removed. Check the navigation unit connector
A (17P) for a non-factory jumper wire in series with the factory cable.
Is there a jumper wire?
YES -Remove the jumper wire, and re-test. Return the jumper wire to Tech
Line.
NO -Go to step 3.
3. Check if the audio unit works.
Does the audio unit work with the ignition switch off?
YES -Troubleshoot the ACC circuit for a short to power with another circuit.
NO -Replace the navigation unit (see NAVIGATION UNIT
REMOVAL/INSTALLATION).
