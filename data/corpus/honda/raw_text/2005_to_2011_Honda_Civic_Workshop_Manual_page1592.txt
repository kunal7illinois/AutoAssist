1. Connect the Honda Diagnostic System (HDS) to the data link connector (DLC)
(see step 2 in HOW TO USE THE HDS (HONDA DIAGNOSTIC
SYSTEM) ).
2. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
3. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the ECM/PCM. If it
doesn't, troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT
TROUBLESHOOTING ).
4. Go to PGM-FI, and check for DTCs (see DTC TROUBLESHOOTING ).
5. Do the following tests while monitoring parameters in the PGM-FI DATA
LIST with the HDS.
NOTE: Intermittent failures are often caused by loose circuit
connections. While monitoring cruise control inputs, flex
their circuits, and note if any of the test results change.
