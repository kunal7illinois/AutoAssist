The PCM controls the shift solenoid valves. The conditions of the shift solenoid
valves and positions of the shift valve are as follows:
Shift solenoid valve A is turned OFF, shift valve A remains on the right side,
(cid:1)
and cut valve A remains on the left side.
Shift solenoid valve B is turned OFF, and shift valve B remains on the right
(cid:1)
side.
Shift solenoid valve C is turned OFF, and shift valve C remains on the right
(cid:1)
side.
Line pressure (1) passes through the manual valve and stops at cut valve B. Line
pressure (1) also flows to shift solenoid valves, and A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valve A. Under this condition, hydraulic pressure is not applied to the
clutches.
