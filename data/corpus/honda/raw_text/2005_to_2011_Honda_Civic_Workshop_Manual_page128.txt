Self-diagnostic System
A self-diagnostic circuit is built into the SRS unit; when the ignition switch is
turned ON (II), the SRS indicator comes on and goes off after about 6 seconds if the
system is operating normally.
If the indicator does not come on, or does not go off after 6 seconds, or if it comes
on while driving, it indicates an abnormality in the system. The system must be
inspected and repaired as soon as possible.
For better serviceability, the SRS unit memory stores a DTC that relates to the
cause of the malfunction, and the unit is connected to the data link connector
(DLC). This information can be read with the HDS when it is connected to the DLC
(see GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION).
NOTE: Before you disconnect the negative cable from the battery
for troubleshooting, make sure you have the anti-theft code
for the audio system or the navigation system (if equipped).
