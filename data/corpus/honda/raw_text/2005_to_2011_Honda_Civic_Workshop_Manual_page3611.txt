GPS Antenna
The GPS antenna amplifies and transmits the signals received from the satellites to
the GPS receiver.
GPS Receiver and Clock
The GPS receiver is built into the navigation unit. It calculates the vehicle position
by receiving the signal from the GPS antenna. The current time vehicle position and
signal reception condition is transmitted from the GPS receiver to the navigation
unit to adjust vehicle position.

destination. The unit performs map matching correction, GPS correction, and
distance tuning. It also controls the menu functions and the DVD-ROM drive, and
interprets voice commands. With control of all these items, the navigation unit
makes the navigation picture signal, then it transmits the signal to the navigation
