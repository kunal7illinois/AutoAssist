3. Clean all ring grooves thoroughly with a squared-off broken ring or ring
groove cleaner with a blade to fit the piston grooves.
The top and 2nd ring grooves are 1.2 mm (0.05 in.) wide. The oil ring groove
is 2.0 mm (0.08 in.) wide. File down a blade if necessary.
Do not use a wire brush to clean the ring grooves, or cut the ring grooves
deeper with the cleaning tools.
NOTE: If the piston is to be separated from the connecting rod,
do not install new rings yet.
4. Using a piston that has its rings removed, push a new ring (A) into the cylinder
bore 15-20 mm (0.6-0.8 in.) from the bottom.
