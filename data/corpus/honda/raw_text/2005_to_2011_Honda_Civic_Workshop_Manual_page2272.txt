6. If the plastigage measures too wide or too narrow, remove the crankshaft, and
remove the upper half of the bearing. Install a new, complete bearing with the
same color code(s), and recheck the clearance. Do not file, shim, or scrape the
bearings or the caps to adjust clearance.
7. If the plastigage shows the clearance is still incorrect, try the next larger or
smaller bearing (the color listed above or below the current one), and check
again. If the proper clearance cannot be obtained by using the appropriate
larger or smaller bearings, replace the crankshaft, and start over.

Crankshaft Bore Code Location
1. Numbers, letters or bars have been stamped on the either side of the block end
as a code for the size of each of the five main journal bores. Write down the
crank bore codes.
If you can't read the codes because of accumulated dirt and dust, do not scrub
them with a wire brush or scraper. Clean them only with solvent or detergent.
