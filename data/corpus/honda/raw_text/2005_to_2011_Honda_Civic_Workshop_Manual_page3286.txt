5. If the indicated maintenance is not done, the engine oil life indicator shows a
negative mileage, for example "-10,", on the display. If the negative mileage is
between 0 and -9, the indicator is displayed for only a few seconds when the
ignition switch is turned to the ON (II) position. The negative mileage remains
displayed after the vehicle is driven more than 10 miles (for USA models) or
10 km (for Canada models) after 0% oil life is reached. This means the
indicated maintenance item(s) should have been done more than 10 miles (or
10 km) ago.

Resetting the Maintenance Information Display
NOTE:
The vehicle must be stopped to reset the display.
(cid:1)
If a required service is done and the display is not reset,
(cid:1)
or if the maintenance display is reset without doing the
service, the system will not show the proper
maintenance timing. This can lead to serious
mechanical problems because there will be no accurate
record of when the required maintenance is needed.
1. Turn the ignition switch to the ON (II) position.
