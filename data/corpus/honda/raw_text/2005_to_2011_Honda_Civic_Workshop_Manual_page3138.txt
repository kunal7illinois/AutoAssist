Is there continuity?
YES -Go to step 6.
NO -Repair open in the wire between ignition coil relay 3P socket terminal No.
2 and body ground.
6. Connect the Honda Diagnostic System (HDS) to the data link connector (DLC)
(see step 2 on HOW TO USE THE HDS (HONDA DIAGNOSTIC
SYSTEM) ).
7. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
8. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the engine control
module (ECM)/powertrain control module (PCM). If it doesn't, troubleshoot
the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
9. Jump the SCS line with the HDS, then turn the ignition switch OFF.
NOTE: This step must be done to protect the ECM/PCM from
damage.
10. Disconnect ECM/PCM connector A (44P).
