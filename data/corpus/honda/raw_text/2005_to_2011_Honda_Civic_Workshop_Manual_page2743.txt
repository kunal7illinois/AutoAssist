FUEL PUMP CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING
If you suspect a problem with the fuel pump, check that the fuel pump actually
runs; when it is on, you will hear some noise if you listen to the fuel fill port with
the fuel fill cap removed. The fuel pump should run for 2 seconds when the ignition
switch is first turned on. If the fuel pump does not make noise, check as follows:
1. Turn the ignition switch OFF.
2. Remove the under-dash fuse/relay box (see REMOVAL AND
INSTALLATION ), then remove PGM-FI main relay 2 (FUEL PUMP) (A)
from the under-dash fuse/relay box.
