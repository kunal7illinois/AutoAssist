Is there continuity?
YES -Check for loose wires or poor connections at the heater control panel
24P connector and at the air mix control motor 7P connector. If the
connections are good, substitute a known-good heater control panel and
recheck. If the symptom/indication goes away, replace the original heater
control panel.
NO -Repair any open in the wires between the heater control panel and the air
mix control motor.
