Fig. 16: Identifying A-Pillar Trim
1. Pull the door opening seal away from the A-pillar as needed:
2-door (see step 5 in TRIM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION - DOOR
(cid:1)
AREAS )
4-door (see step 4 in TRIM REMOVAL/INSTALLATION - DOOR
(cid:1)
AREAS )
2. Hit the upper clip in the A-pillar trim (A) with a rubber mallet. The clip is
under the "SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAG" mark (B). Hitting the clip breaks the
projections (C) on the pin (D) and pushes it into the grommet (E) and against
the body (F). The grommet becomes narrow.
NOTE: The clip must be replaced with a new one when the A-
pillar trim is reinstalled.
