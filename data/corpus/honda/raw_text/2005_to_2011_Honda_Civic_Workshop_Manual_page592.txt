Unfortunately, there are no error messages and no diagnostics for the PC card.
There are many reasons why a card won't play audio files in the audio unit.
The card may not be fully inserted into the slot. Eject the card, and inspect for
(cid:1)
warping or damage to the edge connector. Never use excessive force to insert a
card. This can result in damage to the pins in the rear of the slot.
The customer's card may contain audio files that are not recognized by the
(cid:1)
system. Only MP3 and WMA music files are played.
The flash card type may not be accepted by the system. Only Compact Flash
(cid:1)
and ATA cards have been tested.
The card's PCMCIA adapter may be preventing a known-good card from
(cid:1)
playing. New PCMCIA adapters are constantly being released and have not
been tested.
The card's capacity may exceed 1 GB. Only cards with capacities of up to 1
(cid:1)
GB (1000 MB) have been tested.
There may not be any files on the card. Some cards have write protection.
(cid:1)
Make sure it is turned off before putting files on the card.
Although flash memory chips are reliable, occasionally they develop bad
(cid:1)
sectors or other formatting errors that prevent them from playing. The
customer should reformat the card using the FAT or FAT32 format.
