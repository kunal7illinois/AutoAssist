11. Clean the areas where the driveshaft contacts the transmission (differential)
with solvent, and dry with compressed air. Then install the driveshaft, be sure
not to allow dust or other foreign particles to enter the transmission. Turn the
steering knuckle fully outward, and slide the driveshaft into the differential
until you feel its set ring fully engage the side gear.
12. Attach the torque converter to the drive plate with the eight bolts (A). Rotate
the crankshaft pulley as necessary to tighten the bolts to 1/2 of the specified
torque, then to the final torque, in a crisscross pattern. After tightening the last
bolt, check that the crankshaft rotate freely.
