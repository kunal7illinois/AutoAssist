1. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
2. Clear the DTC with the HDS.
3. Turn the ignition switch OFF.
4. Remove the fuel fill cap, and wait 1 minute.
5. Check the FTP SENSOR in the DATA LIST with the HDS.
Is it between - 0.67 and 0.67 kPa (- 0.2 and 0.2 in.Hg, -5 and 5 mmHg), or 2.4
and 2.6 V?

6. Install the fuel fill cap.
7. Clear the DTC with the HDS.
8. Start the engine. Hold the engine speed at 3,000 rpm without load (in Park on
neutral) until the radiator fan comes on, then let it idle.
9. Monitor the OBD STATUS for DTC P1454 in the DTCs MENU with the
HDS.
Does the screen indicate FAILED?
YES - Go to step 10.
NO - If the screen indicates PASSED, intermittent failure, the system is OK at
this time. Check for poor connections or loose terminals at the FTP sensor, the
EVAP canister vent shut valve, and the ECM/PCM. Also check for a blockage
in the vent hoses and the drain joint. If the screen indicates NOT
COMPLETED, keep idling until a result comes on.
