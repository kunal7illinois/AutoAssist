15. Install the brake pads and pad shims correctly. Install the brake pad with the
wear indicator (C) on the upper inside. If you are reusing the brake pads,
always reinstall the brake pads in their original positions to prevent a
temporary loss of braking efficiency.
16. Pivot the caliper down into position. Install the flange bolt (A), and tighten it to
the specified torque while holding the caliper pin (B), with a wrench. Be
careful not to damage the pin boot.
