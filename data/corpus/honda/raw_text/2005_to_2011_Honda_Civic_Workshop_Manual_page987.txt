6. If the level is below the lower mark, check for fluid leaks at the transmission,
the hoses, and the line joints. If a problem is found, fix it before filling the
transmission with ATF.
NOTE: If the vehicle is driven when the ATF level is below the
lower mark:
Transmission damage will result.
(cid:1)
The vehicle might not move in any gear.
(cid:1)
The vehicle may accelerate poorly, and flare when
(cid:1)
starting off in D and R.
The engine may vibrate at idle.

7. If the level is above the upper mark, drain the ATF to proper level (see step 3 ).
NOTE: If the vehicle is driven when the ATF level is above the
upper mark, the vehicle may creep forward while in N,
or have problems shifting.
8. If necessary, fill the transmission with ATF through the dipstick hole (A) to
bring the fluid level between the upper mark and the lower mark of the
dipstick. Do not fill the fluid above the upper mark. Always use genuine Honda
ATF-Z1 automatic transmission fluid (ATF). Using a non-Honda ATF can
affect shift quality.
