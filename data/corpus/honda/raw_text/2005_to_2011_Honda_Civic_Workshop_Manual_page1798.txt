ECM/PCM was substituted, replace the original ECM/PCM (see ECM/PCM
REPLACEMENT ). If any other Temporary DTCs or DTCs were indicated in step
37, go to the indicated DTCs troubleshooting.
NO - If the screen indicates FAILED, check for poor connections or loose terminals
at the EGR valve and the ECM/PCM. If the ECM/PCM was updated, substitute a
known-good ECM/PCM (see SUBSTITUTING THE ECM/PCM ), then go to
step 35. If the ECM/PCM was substituted, go to step 1. If the screen indicates
