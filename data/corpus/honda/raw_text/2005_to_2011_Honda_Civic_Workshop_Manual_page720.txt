D Position: Driving in 5th gear
The PCM turns shift solenoid valve C OFF, shift solenoid valve A remains OFF,
and B remains ON. Shift solenoid valve C pressure (SC) is then released to the right
side of shift valve C. This causes shift valve C to move to the right side, releasing
the 4th clutch pressure. The 5th clutch is engaged by the A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valve C pressure mode.
NOTE: When used, "left" or "right" indicates direction on the
hydraulic circuit.
