2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 STEERING EPS System - Civic (All Except Hybrid & Si)
If the CPU cannot be activated, or it fails, the EPS indicator comes on, but the
(cid:1)
DTC is not memorized.
The memory can hold any number of DTCs. However, when the same DTC is
(cid:1)
detected more than once, the most recent DTC is written over the prior DTC,
therefore only one occurance is memorized.
The lowest DTC is indicated first. The DTCs are indicated in ascending order,
(cid:1)
not in the order that they occurred.
The DTCs are memorized in the EEPROM (nonvolatile memory) therefore the
(cid:1)
memorized DTCs cannot be erased by disconnecting the battery. Perform the
specified procedures to clear DTCs.
SELF-DIAGNOSIS
Self-diagnosis can be classified into three categories:
Initial diagnosis: Done right after the engine starts and until the EPS indicator
(cid:1)
goes off.
Regular diagnosis: Done right after the initial diagnosis until the ignition
(cid:1)
switch is turned OFF.
Steering diagnosis: Done during regular diagnosis while turning steering
(cid:1)
wheel.
The EPS control unit performs the following functions when a problem is detected
by self-diagnosis:
1. Turns on the EPS indicator.
2. Memorizes the DTC.
3. Stops power assist and manual steering operation resumes.
NOTE: For DTCs 11-01, 11-02, 12-01,21-01,21-02, 22-01 and 35-
04 the EPS indicator will go off automatically, and the
system returns to normal.
