YAW Rate-Lateral Acceleration Sensor 5P Connector Terminal
Is there continuity?
YES -Go to step 8.
NO -Repair open in the wire between the yaw rate-lateral acceleration sensor
and the VSA modulator-control unit.
8. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
9. Measure voltage between yaw rate-lateral acceleration sensor 5P connector
terminal No. 1 and body ground.

Sensor 5P Connector Terminal And Body Ground
Is there battery voltage?
YES -Go to step 10.
NO -Check the No. 4 (7.5 A) fuse in the under-dash fuse/relay box. If the fuse
is OK, repair open in the wire between the No. 4 (7.5 A) fuse and yaw rate-
lateral acceleration sensor.
10. Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0).
11. Reconnect the yaw rate-lateral acceleration sensor 5P connector.
12. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
13. Measure voltage between yaw rate-lateral acceleration sensor 5P connector
terminal No. 5 and body ground.
