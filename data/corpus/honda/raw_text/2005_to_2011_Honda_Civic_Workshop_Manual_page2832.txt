CALIBRATION
The outside air temperature indicator's displayed temperature can be recalibrated
±5°F (or ±3°C) to meet the customer's expectations.
1. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
2. Select the outside air temperature display.
3. Press and hold the SEL/RESET switch until the trip meter resets, then release
it. Press, and continue to hold, the switch again, and the display will scroll
through temperature settings from +5°F to -5°F (or +3°C to -3°C) as shown.

4. When the desired correction value appears on the display, release the button,
and the recalibrated outside air temperature will be displayed.
Example:
Incorrect value = 68°F (20 °C)
Desired correction value = +2°F (+1°C)
Correct valve = 70°F (21°C)
Desired correction value = -2°F (-1°C)
Correct valve = 66°F (19°C)
NOTE: The recalibration temperature is not the value the
sensor sees. Therefore the temperature can only be
adjusted ±5 degrees from the sensor.
NOTE: To recalibrate the display to the true temperature,
remove the outside air temperature sensor (A), but
leave it connected. Submerge the sensor and a
thermometer (B) in a container of ice water (C). Select
the calibration mode as described above, then
