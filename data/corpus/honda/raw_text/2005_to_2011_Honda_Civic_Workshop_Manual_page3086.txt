NOTE: Do not install an A/C compressor into a system unless you
are completely sure that the system is free of
contamination. Installing the A/C compressor into a
contaminated system can result in premature A/C
compressor failure.
1. If the A/C compressor is marginally operable, run the engine at idle speed, and
let the air conditioning work for a few minutes, then shut the engine off.
2. Recover the refrigerant with a recovery/recycling/charging station (see
REFRIGERANT RECOVERY ).
3. Remove the front grille cover (see FRONT GRILLE COVER
REPLACEMENT ) and the drive belt (see DRIVE BELT INSPECTION ).
4. Remove the clips (A) and the bolts.
