5. Measure the piston ring end-gap (B) with a feeler gauge:
If the gap is too small, check to see if you have the proper rings for your

If the gap is too large, recheck the cylinder bore diameter against the wear
(cid:1)
limits, refer to the BLOCK AND PISTON INSPECTION . If the bore is
beyond the service limit, the engine block must be rebored.
