2008 Honda Civic GX
2006-08 BRAKES VSA System - Civic (All Except Hybrid)
NO -Intermittent failure, the system is OK at this time. Check for loose
terminals at the VSA modulator-control unit 37P connector. Refer to
INTERMITTENT FAILURES TROUBLESHOOTING (see ).
5. Check and note BATTERY voltage in the VSA DATA LIST with the H DS. If
the voltage listed is 0 V, go to step 8, otherwise go to step 6.
6. Using a voltmeter, measure and note the voltage between the battery terminals.
NOTE: If the voltage is below 9.5 V, check the battery (see
BATTERY TEST ), and troubleshoot the alternator
regulator circuit (see ALTERNATOR AND REGULATOR
CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
7. Compare the voltage noted in step 5 to the voltage in step 6.
Is the difference between the two voltage readings less then 3 V?
YES -Intermittent failure, the system is OK at this time. Check for loose
terminals at the VSA modulator-control unit 37P connector. Refer to
INTERMITTENT FAILURES TROUBLESHOOTING (see ). If the code
resets after clearing, replace the VSA modulator-control unit (see VSA
MODULATOR-CONTROL UNIT REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION ).
NO -Check for loose terminals in the VSA modulator-control unit 37P
connector. If necessary, substitute a known-good VSA modulator-control unit
(see VSA MODULATOR-CONTROL UNIT REMOVAL AND
INSTALLATION ), and retest.
8. Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0).
9. Disconnect the VSA modulator-control unit 37P connector.
10. Measure voltage between VSA modulator-control unit 37P connector terminal
No. 13 and body ground.
