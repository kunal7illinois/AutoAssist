(see step 2 in HOW TO USE THE HDS (HONDA DIAGNOSTIC
SYSTEM) ).
21. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
22. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the ECM. If it doesn't,
troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
23. Jump the SCS line with the HDS, then turn the ignition switch OFF.
NOTE: This step must be done to protect the ECM from
damage.
24. Disconnect ECM connector B (44P).
25. Check for continuity between ECM connector terminal B42 and alternator 4P
connector terminal No. 3.

Is there continuity?
YES - Update the ECM if it does not have the latest software (see
UPDATING THE ECM ), or substitute a known-good ECM (see
SUBSTITUTING THE ECM ), then recheck. If the symptom/indication goes
away with a known-good ECM, replace the original ECM (see ECM
REPLACEMENT ).
