2. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
3. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the VSA modulator-
control unit. If it doesn't, troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT
TROUBLESHOOTING ).
4. Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) and note it. Also check the on board
snapshot data, and download any data found. Then refer to the indicated DTC's
troubleshooting, and begin the appropriate troubleshooting procedure.
NOTE:
The HDS communication will be stopped when the
(cid:1)
vehicle speed is at 31 mph (50 km/h) or more.
The HDS can read the DTC, current data, and other
(cid:1)
system data.
For specific operations, refer to the Help menu that
(cid:1)
came with the HDS.
