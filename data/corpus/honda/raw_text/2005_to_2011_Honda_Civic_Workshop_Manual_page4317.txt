learns the current driver's normal braking characteristics by monitoring the brake
pressure sensor and the brake pedal position switch at each stop. Using these inputs
and their values, the VSA modulator-control unit is able to learn the driver's normal
braking habits, and then determine the difference between a normal stop and a panic
stop for the individual driver of the vehicle. If during a panic stop the VSA
modulator-control unit determines that the brake system pressure increases above a
learned threshold in less than a learned amount of time, the VSA modulator-control
unit engages brake assist. Because the brake system pressure crossed the threshold
before the time threshold had expired, the VSA modulator-control unit goes into
brake assist mode.

Modulator Unit
The modulator unit consists of the inlet solenoid valve, the outlet solenoid valve,
the VSA NO (normally open) solenoid valve, the VSA NC (normally closed)
solenoid valve, the reservoir, the pump, the pump motor, and the damping chamber.
The hydraulic control has three modes at ABS action; pressure intensifying,
pressure retaining, and pressure reducing.
And pressure adding mode is combined at TCS, VSA, and brake assist action.
The hydraulic circuit is an independent four channel type; one channel for each
wheel.
