3. Clean all the ring grooves thoroughly with a squared-off broken ring, or a ring
groove cleaner with a blade to fit the piston grooves. File down a blade if
necessary. The top ring and second ring grooves are 1.2 mm (0.05 in.) wide,
and the oil ring groove is 2.0 mm (0.08 in.) wide. Do not use a wire brush to
clean the ring grooves, or cut the ring grooves deeper with the cleaning tools.
NOTE: If the piston is to be separated from the connecting rod,
do not install new rings yet.
4. Using a piston, push a new ring (A) into the cylinder bore 15-20 mm (0.6-0.8
in.) from the bottom.
