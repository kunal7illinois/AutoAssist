2. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
3. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the EPS control unit. If
it doesn't, troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT
TROUBLESHOOTING ).
4. Clear the DTC(s) by following the screen prompts on the HDS.
NOTE: See the HDS Help menu for specific instructions.
5. Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0).
MEMORIZING THE TORQUE SENSOR NEUTRAL POSITION
The torque sensor neutral position must be memorized whenever the gearbox, the
motor, or the EPS control unit is replaced. Note that the torque sensor neutral
position is not affected when erasing the DTC.
NOTE: The torque sensor is sensitive to temperature. This
procedure should be performed within the range of 68°F ±
50°F (20°C ± 10°C).
1. With the ignition switch in LOCK (0) position, connect the HDS to the data
link connector (DLC) (A) located under the driver's side of the dashboard.
