TALK and BACK buttons. They are used to activate the voice control system. The

Press the BACK button on the steering wheel. The Cancel indicator on the
(cid:1)
screen should momentarily turn green. If it does not briefly turn green, then
check the wiring from the steering wheel BACK button to the navigation unit.
