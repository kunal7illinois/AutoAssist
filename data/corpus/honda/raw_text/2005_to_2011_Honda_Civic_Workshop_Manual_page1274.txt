DRIVE AXLE - NOISE DIAGNOSIS
Unrelated Noises
Some driveline trouble symptoms are also common to the engine, transmission,
wheel bearings, tires, and other parts of the vehicle. Ensure cause of trouble actually
is in the drive axle before adjusting, repairing, or replacing any of its parts.
Non-Drive Axle Noises
A few conditions can sound just like drive axle noise and have to be considered in
pre-diagnosis. The 4 most common noises are exhaust, tires, CV/universal joints
and wheel trim rings.
In certain conditions, the pitch of the exhaust gases may e gear whine. At other
times, it may be mistaken for a wheel bearing rumble.
Tires, especially radial and snow, can have a high-pitched tread whine or roar,
similar to gear noise. Also, some non-standard tires with an unusual tread
construction may emit a roar or whine.
