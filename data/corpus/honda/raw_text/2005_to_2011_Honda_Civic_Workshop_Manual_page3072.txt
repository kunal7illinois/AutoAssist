Fig. 71: Measuring Evaporator Temperature Sensor Resistance Between
HVAC Control Unit 24P Connector Terminals No. 2 And No. 13
Is resistance less than 24 kohms ?
YES - Go to step 13.
NO - Test the evaporator temperature sensor (see EVAPORATOR
TEMPERATURE SENSOR TEST ).
13. Reconnect the HVAC control unit 24P connector.
14. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
15. Check if the blower motor operates at all speeds.
Does the blower motor operates at all speeds?
YES - Check for loose wires or poor connections at the HVAC control unit
24P connector. If the connections are good, substitute a known-good HVAC
control unit and recheck. If the symptom goes away, replace the original
HVAC control unit.
NO - Repair the problem in the blower motor circuit.
EVAPORATOR TEMPERATURE SENSOR TEST
1. Remove the evaporator core and the evaporator temperature sensor (see
EVAPORATOR CORE REPLACEMENT ).
2. Dip the sensor in ice water, and measure the resistance between its terminals.
