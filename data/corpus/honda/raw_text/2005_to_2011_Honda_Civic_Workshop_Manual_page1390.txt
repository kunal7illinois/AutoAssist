2. Remove the front wheels.
3. Remove the brake pads (see REPLACEMENT ).
4. Using a micrometer, measure the brake disc thickness at eight points, about 45°
apart and 10 mm (3/8 in.) in from the outer edge of the brake disc. Replace the
brake disc if the smallest measurement is less than the max. refinishing limit.
Brake disc thickness:
Standard: 22.9-23.1 mm (0.90-0.91 in.)
Max. refinishing limit: 21.0 mm (0.83 in.)
Brake disc parallelism: 0.015 mm (0.0006 in.) max.
NOTE: This is the maximum allowable difference between the
thickness measurements.

5. If the brake disc is beyond the service limit for parallelism, refinish the brake
disc with an on-car brake lathe. The Kwik-Lathe produced by Kwik-Way
Manufacturing Co. and the "Front Brake Disc Lathe" offered by Snap-on Tools
Co. are approved for this operation.
NOTE: If the brake disc is beyond the service limit for
refinishing, replace it, refer to the
