14. Measure the resistance of each solenoid valve between the connector terminal
and body ground.
Standard: 12-25 ohms
If the resistance is out of standard, go to step 17 and replace the shift
(cid:1)
solenoid valve.
If the resistance is within the standard, go to step 15 and check the
(cid:1)
solenoid valve for a clicking sound.
15. Connect a jumper wire from the positive battery terminal to each solenoid
terminal individually.
If a clicking sound is heard, go to step 16 and replace the solenoid harness.
(cid:1)
If no clicking sound is heard, go to step 17 and replace shift solenoid
(cid:1)
valve.
16. Remove the shift solenoid harness connector (A), and replace it. Install a new
O-ring (B) on the shift solenoid harness connector, and install the connector in
the transmission housing, then go to step 22.
