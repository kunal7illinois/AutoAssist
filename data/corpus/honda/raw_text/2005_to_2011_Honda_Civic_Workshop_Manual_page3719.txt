When the system sounds the alarm, the horn sounds and the exterior lights flash for
2 minutes. The alarm can be stopped at any time by unlocking the driver's door with
the key or by pressing any button on the transmitter.
PANIC MODE
The panic mode sounds the alarm in order to attract attention. When the PANIC
button on the transmitter is pressed and held for 2 seconds, the horn sounds and the
exterior lights flash for about 20 seconds.
The panic mode can be cancelled at anytime by pressing any button on the
transmitter or by turning the ignition switch ON (II). The panic mode will not
function if the ignition switch is ON (II).
KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEM
The keyless entry system is integrated with the multiplex integrated control system.
The multiplex integrated control unit (MICU) receives LOCK, UNLOCK and
PANIC signals from the immobilizer-keyless control unit (keyless receiver).
The keyless entry system allows you to lock and unlock the vehicle with the
transmitter. When you press the LOCK button, all doors lock. When you press the
UNLOCK button once, only the driver's door unlocks. The other doors will unlock
when you press the button a second time. The doors will not lock with the
transmitter if a door is not fully closed, or if the key is in the ignition switch.
When the switch for the ceiling light is in the center (DOOR) position, it will come
on when the UNLOCK button is pressed. If a door is not opened, the light will go
off in about 30 seconds, and the doors will relock. If the doors are locked with the
transmitter within 30 seconds, the light will go off immediately.
