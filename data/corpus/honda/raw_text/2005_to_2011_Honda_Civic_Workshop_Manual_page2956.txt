Is there continuity?
YES -Check for loose wires or poor connections at the heater control panel
24P connector. If the connections are good, substitute a known-good heater
control panel, and recheck.
NO -Check for an open in the wire between the heater control panel and body
ground. If the wire is OK, check for poor ground at G504 (see CONNECTOR
TO HARNESS INDEX ).
POWER TRANSISTOR TEST
1. Remove the passenger's dashboard undercover (see PASSENGER's
DASHBOARD UNDERCOVER REMOVAL/INSTALLATION ).
2. Disconnect the 4P connector from the power transistor.
3. Measure the resistance between the No. 3 and No. 4 terminals of the power
transistor. It should be about 1.5 kohms.
If the resistance is within the specifications, go to step 4.
(cid:1)
If the resistance is not within the specifications, replace the power
(cid:1)
transistor.
NOTE: Also check the blower motor. Power transistor failure
can be caused by a defective blower motor.
