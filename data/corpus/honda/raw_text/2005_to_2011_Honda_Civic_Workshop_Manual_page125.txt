Front Passenger's Weight Sensors
The front passenger's weight sensors (M) are part of seat base. The front passenger's
weight sensors detect the weight on the seat, and send the information to the ODS
unit (N). If the total weight is about 65 lbs (30 kg) or less, the ODS unit sends a
signal to the SRS unit to prevent the passenger's airbag from deploying. When the
passenger's airbag is disabled, the passenger airbag cutoff indicator on the center
panel comes on to alert the driver that the front passenger's airbag will not deploy in
a front-end collision.
Driver's Seat Position Sensor
The driver's seat position sensor (O) is under the driver's seat on the left side. When
the driver's seat is moved to its full forward position, the deployment of the driver's
airbag is moderated to decrease its force of impact during a front-end collision.
