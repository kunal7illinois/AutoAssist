5. Measure the piston ring end-gap (B) with a feeler gauge:
If the gap is too small, check to see if you have the proper rings for your
(cid:1)
engine.
If the gap is too large, recheck the cylinder bore diameter against the wear
(cid:1)
limits (see BLOCK AND PISTON INSPECTION ). If the bore is
beyond the service limit, the engine block must be rebored.
