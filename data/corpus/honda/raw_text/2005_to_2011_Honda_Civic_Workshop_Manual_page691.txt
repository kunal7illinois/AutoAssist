Shift solenoid valve D controls the hydraulic pressure to switch the lock-up shift
valve and lock-up ON and OFF. The PCM actuates shift solenoid valve D and A/T
clutch pressure control solenoid valve A to start lock-up. A/T clutch pressure
control solenoid valve A applies and regulates hydraulic pressure to the lock-up
control valve to control the volume of the lock-up. The lock-up mechanism operates
in D (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th gears) and in D3 (1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears).
