STEERING WHEEL ROTATIONAL PLAY CHECK
1. Turn the front wheels to the straight ahead position.
2. Measure how far you can turn the steering wheel left and right without moving
the front wheels.
If the play is within the limit, the gearbox and linkages are OK.
(cid:1)
If the play exceeds the limit, adjust the rack guide: power steering type
(cid:1)
(see HYDRAULIC POWER STEERING TYPE ), EPS type (see EPS
TYPE ). If the play is still excessive after rack guide adjustment, inspect
the steering linkage and gearbox (see STEERING LINKAGE AND
GEARBOX INSPECTION ).
