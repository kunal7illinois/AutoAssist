2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 HVAC Heating/Air Conditioning - Civic (All Except Hybrid)
All A/C system parts (A/C compressor, discharge line, suction line, evaporator,
(cid:1)
A/C condenser, receiver/dryer, expansion valve, O-rings for joints) are
designed for refrigerant R-134a. Do not exchange with R-12 parts.
Use a halogen gas leak detector designed for refrigerant R-134a.
(cid:1)
R-12 and R-134a refrigerant servicing equipment are not interchangeable. Use
(cid:1)
only a recovery/recycling/charging station that is U.L.-listed and is certified to
meet the requirements of SAE J2210 to service the R-134a air conditioning
systems.
Always recover refrigerant R-134a with an approved
(cid:1)
recovery/recycling/charging station before disconnecting any A/C fitting.
OIL SEPARATOR
Oil emission from the A/C compressor to the A/C line is reduced by placing the oil
separator in the A/C compressor. This results in a thinner oil film inside of the heat
exchanger (A/C condenser and evaporator). Air conditioning efficiency is increased
without sacrificing engine performance.
