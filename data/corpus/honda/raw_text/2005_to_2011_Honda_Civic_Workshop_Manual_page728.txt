Fluid in the chamber between the torque converter cover and the torque converter
clutch piston is drained off, and fluid entering from the chamber between the pump
and the stator exerts pressure through the torque converter clutch piston against the
torque converter cover. The torque converter clutch piston engages with the torque
converter cover; the torque converter clutch locks-up, and the mainshaft rotates at
the same as the engine.

Torque Converter Clutch Lock-up OFF (Disengaging Torque Converter Clutch)
Fluid entered from the chamber between the torque converter cover and the torque
converter clutch piston passes through the torque converter and goes out from the
chambers between the turbine and the stator, and the pump and the stator. As a
result, the torque converter clutch piston moves away from the torque converter
cover, and the torque converter clutch lock-up is released.
