Fig. 41: Installing Clip To Quarter Pillar Trim
15. Reinstall the quarter pillar trim (A).
-1 Fit the upper edge of the trim to the headliner (B).
-2 Place the trim over the center/C-pillar (C), and fit its B-pillar upper clip
(D), C-pillar upper clip (E), and all of the other clips (F, G) into holes (H)
in the body, then lightly push the trim into place.
NOTE:
Make sure the side curtain airbag isn't tucked
(cid:1)
down under the clips and ribs.
Apply pressure to the areas of the trim just
(cid:1)
upon the quarter/C-pillar upper clips until these
clip fittings are felt. If you push too hard, the
clip will be damaged, and it will not hold the
trim properly.

(cid:1)
don't come off the body by tugging on the trim
