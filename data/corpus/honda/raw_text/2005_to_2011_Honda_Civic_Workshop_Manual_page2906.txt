17. With a sponge, apply a light coat of glass primer along the edge of the rear
window (A) between the dams (B) as shown, then lightly wipe it off with
gauze or cheesecloth:
With the printed dots (D) on the rear window as a guide, apply the glass
(cid:1)
primer to both lower corner portions of the rear window.
Do not apply body primer to the rear window, and do not get body and

glass primer sponges mixed up.
Never touch the primed surfaces with your hands. If you do, the adhesive

window is installed.
Keep water, dust, and abrasive materials away from primed surfaces.
