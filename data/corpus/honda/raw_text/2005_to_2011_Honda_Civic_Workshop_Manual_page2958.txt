AIR MIX CONTROL MOTOR TEST
NOTE: Before testing, check for HVAC DTCs (see HOW TO USE
THE SELF-DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTION ).
1. Disconnect the 7P connector from the air mix control motor.
NOTE: Incorrectly applying power and ground to the air mix
control motor will damage it. Follow the instructions
carefully.
2. Connect battery power to the No. 1 terminal of the air mix control motor, and
ground the No. 2 terminal; the air mix control motor should run, and stop at
Max Hot. If it doesn't, reverse the connections; the air mix control motor
should run, and stop at Max Cool. When the air mix control motor stops
running, disconnect battery power immediately.

(see AIR MIX CONTROL MOTOR TEST ).
If the linkage or door sticks or binds, repair them as needed.
