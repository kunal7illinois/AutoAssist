The PCM turns shift solenoid valve B ON, and shift solenoid valves A and C
remain OFF. Shift solenoid valve B pressure (SB) is applied to the right side of shift
valve B. Shift valve B then moves to the left side, causing the line pressure port
leading to the 1st clutch to be uncovered, and the A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valve A pressure port to be covered. Line pressure (1B) passed through
shift valve B flows to the manual valve, shift valve A, and shift valve C, and
becomes 1st clutch pressure (10). 1st clutch pressure is applied to the 1st clutch, and
the 1st clutch is engaged by the line pressure mode.
