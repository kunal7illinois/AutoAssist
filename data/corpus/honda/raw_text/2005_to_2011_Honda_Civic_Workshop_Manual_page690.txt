Clutch Pressure Control
The PCM actuates A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C to
control the clutch pressure. When shifting between gears, the clutch pressure
regulated by A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C engages and
disengages the clutch smoothly.
The PCM receives input signals from the various sensors and switches, processes
data, and outputs current to A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and
C.
