Hydraulic Flow
Distribution of Hydraulic Pressure
As the engine turns, the ATF pump starts to operate. Automatic transmission fluid
(ATF) is drawn through the ATF strainer (filter) and discharged into the hydraulic
circuit. Then, ATF flowing from the ATF pump becomes line pressure that is
regulated by the regulator valve. Torque converter pressure from the regulator valve
enters the torque converter through the lock-up shift valve, and it is discharged from
the torque converter. The torque converter check valve prevents torque converter
pressure from rising.
The PCM turns the shift solenoid valves ON and OFF. The shift solenoid valve
controls line pressure from the ATF pump via the manual valve when the shift
