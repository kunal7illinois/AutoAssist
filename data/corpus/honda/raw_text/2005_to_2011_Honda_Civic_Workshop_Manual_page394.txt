2006-08 RESTRAINTS SRS (Supplemental Restraint System) - Civic (Except Hybrid)
reel.
After the vehicle is completely repaired, turn the ignition switch ON (II). If the SRS
indicator comes on for about 6 seconds and then goes off, the SRS is OK. If the
indicator does not function properly, use the HDS SRS Menu Method to read the
DTC (see GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION). If you cannot
retrieve a code, do the SRS Symptom Troubleshooting.
CHECKING AND ADJUSTING THE HEADLINER/PILLAR TRIM OVERLAP
To prevent the side curtain airbag from deploying and damaging the pillar trim, the
overlap between the headliner and pillar trim must be less then 15 mm (0.6 in.). To
check the overlap, do this:
1. Install the headliner (A) and the pillar trims (B).
