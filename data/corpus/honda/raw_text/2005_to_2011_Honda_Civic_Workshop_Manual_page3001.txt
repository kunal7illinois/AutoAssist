CAUTION:
Air conditioning refrigerant or lubricant vapor
(cid:1)
can irritate your eyes, nose, or throat.

(cid:1)
The air conditioning system uses HFC-134a (R-134a) refrigerant and
polyalkyleneglycol (PAG) refrigerant oil, which are not compatible with CFC-12
(R-12) refrigerant and mineral oil. Do not use R-12 refrigerant or mineral oil in this
system, and do not attempt to use R-12 servicing equipment; damage to the air
conditioning system or your servicing equipment will result. Use only service
equipment that is U.L.-listed and is certified to meet the requirements of SAE J2210
to remove R-134a from the air conditioning system.
If accidental system discharge occurs, ventilate work area before resuming service.
R-134a service equipment or vehicle air conditioning systems should not be
pressure tested or leak tested with compressed air.
Additional health and safety information may be obtained from the refrigerant and
lubricant manufacturers.
Always disconnect the negative cable from the battery whenever replacing air
(cid:1)
conditioning parts.
Keep moisture and dirt out of the system. When disconnecting any lines, plug
(cid:1)
or cap the fittings immediately; don't remove the caps or plugs until just before
you reconnect each line.
Before connecting any hose or line, apply a few drops of refrigerant oil to the
(cid:1)
O-ring.
When tightening or loosening a fitting, use a second wrench to support the
(cid:1)
matching fitting.
When discharging the system, use an R-134a refrigerant
(cid:1)
recovery/recycling/charging station; don't release refrigerant into the
atmosphere.
