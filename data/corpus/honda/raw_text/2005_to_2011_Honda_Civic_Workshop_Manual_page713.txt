As the speed of the vehicle reaches the programmed value, the PCM turns shift
solenoid valve A ON, shift solenoid valve B remains ON, and C remains OFF. Shift
solenoid valve A pressure (SA) is applied to the right end of shift valve A and to the
left side of cut valve A. Cut valve A is moved to the right side to release 1st clutch
pressure in line pressure mode, and shift valve A is moved to the left side to switch
line pressure (5A) port to A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve C pressure
(5C) port leading to the 1st clutch. Also shift valve A uncovers 2nd clutch pressure
(20) port leading A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve B pressure (56) to the
2nd clutch. The 1st clutch and the 2nd clutch are engaged by the A/T clutch
pressure control solenoid valve pressure mode.
