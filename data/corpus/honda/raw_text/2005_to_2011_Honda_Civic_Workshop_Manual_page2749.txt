Is there battery voltage?
YES - Update the ECM/PCM if it does not have the latest software (see
UPDATING ECM/PCM ), or substitute a known-good ECM/PCM (see
SUBSTITUTING THE ECM/PCM ), then recheck. If the
symptom/indication goes away with a known-good ECM/PCM, replace the
original ECM/PCM (see ECM/PCM REPLACEMENT ).
