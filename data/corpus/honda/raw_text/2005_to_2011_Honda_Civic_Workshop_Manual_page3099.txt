Fig. 114: Removing A/C Condenser
8. Install the A/C condenser in the reverse order of removal, and note these items:
If you're installing a new A/C condenser, add refrigerant oil (SP-10) (see
(cid:1)
A/C REFRIGERANT OIL REPLACEMENT ).
Replace the O-rings with new ones at each fitting, and apply a thin coat of
(cid:1)
refrigerant oil before installing them. Be sure to use the correct O-rings for
HFC-134a (R-134a) to avoid leakage.
Immediately after using the oil, reinstall the cap on the container, and seal
(cid:1)
it to avoid moisture absorption.
Do not spill the refrigerant oil on the vehicle; it may damage the paint; if
(cid:1)
the refrigerant oil contacts the paint, wash it off immediately.
Charge the system (see SYSTEM CHARGING ).
