2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 RESTRAINTS SRS (Supplemental Restraint System) - Civic (Except Hybrid)
Before scrapping any airbags, side airbags, side curtain airbags, seat belt tensioners,
or seat belt buckle tensioner (including those in a whole vehicle to be scrapped), the
part(s) must be deployed. If the vehicle is still within the warranty period, the
Honda District Parts and Service Manager must give approval and/or special
instruction before deploying the part(s). Only after the part(s) have been deployed
(as the result of vehicle collision, for example), can they be scrapped. If the parts
appear intact (not deployed), treat them with extreme caution. Follow this
procedure.
DEPLOYING AIRBAGS IN THE VEHICLE
If an SRS equipped vehicle is to be entirely scrapped, its airbags, side airbags, side
curtain airbags, seat belt tensioners, and seat belt buckle tensioner should be
deployed while still in the vehicle. These parts should not be considered as
salvageable parts and should never be installed in another vehicle.
1. Turn the ignition switch OFF, then disconnect the negative cable from the
battery, then wait for 3 minutes before starting work.
2. Confirm that each airbag, side airbag, side curtain airbag, seat belt tensioner, or
seat belt buckle tensioner is securely mounted.
3. Confirm that the deployment tool is functioning properly by following the
check procedure on the tool label.
Driver's Airbag
4. Remove the access panel (A) from the steering wheel then disconnect the
driver's airbag 4P connector (B) from the cable reel.
