solenoid valve is OFF. When the shift solenoid valve is turned ON by the PCM,
line pressure changes to shift solenoid valve pressure at the shift solenoid valve,
then the shift solenoid valve pressure flows to the shift valve. Applying shift
solenoid pressure to the shift valve moves the position of the shift valve, and
switches the port of the hydraulic circuit. The PCM also controls A/T clutch
pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C. The A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valves regulate hydraulic pressure, and apply the pressure to the clutches
to engage smoothly. The clutches receive optimum clutch pressure which is
regulated by the A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves for comfortable driving
and shifting under all conditions.
