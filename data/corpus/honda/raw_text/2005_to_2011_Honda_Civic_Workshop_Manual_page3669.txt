YAW RATE
This diagnostic checks the yaw rate sensor in the control unit. This device detects
when the vehicle turns, and repositions the vehicle position icon on the map screen.
For more detailed information, see YAW RATE SENSOR theory of operation
under System Description.
Sensor indicates the voltage output from the yaw rate sensor. It should indicate
(cid:1)
about 2.500 V when stopped.
Offset is the reference voltage or standard within the yaw rate sensor. It also
(cid:1)
should indicate about 2.500 V when stopped.
A sensor output voltage LOWER than the Offset voltage indicates that the
(cid:1)
vehicle is turning to the right.
