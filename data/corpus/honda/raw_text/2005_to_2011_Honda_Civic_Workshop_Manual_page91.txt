OPENING THE SRS UNIT SHORTING CONNECTORS FOR DIAGNOSIS
Special Tools Required
SRS short canceller 070AZ-SAA0100
NOTE:
To prevent damaging of the connector cavity, insert the
(cid:1)
short canceller straight into the cavity from the terminal
side.
Before installing the short canceller, wash it with
(cid:1)
electric contact cleaner, then dry it with compressed
air.
Do not use the short canceller if it is damaged.
(cid:1)
Make sure to remove the short canceller before
(cid:1)
reconnection.
When SRS unit connectors A (28P) or B (28P) are disconnected, a short circuit is
created in the connector by its own function to prevent an airbag deployment. The
circuit may need to be open sometimes when diagnosis is done on the system. Insert
the short canceller (070AZ-SAA0100) in the specified cavities when it is necessary
to keep the circuit open for diagnosis.
