the head, then lift it and snap it closed against the seat several times.

7. The actual valve seating surface (B), as shown by the blue compound, should
be centered on the seat.
If it is too high (closer to the valve stem), you must make a second cut
(cid:1)
with the 60° cutter to move it down, then one more cut with the 45° cutter
to restore seat width.
If it is too low (closer to the valve edge), you must make a second cut with
(cid:1)
the 30° cutter to move it up, then one more cut with the 45° cutter to
restore seat width.
NOTE: The final cut should always be made with the 45° cutter.
8. Insert the intake and exhaust valves in the head, and measure the valve stem
installed height (A).
