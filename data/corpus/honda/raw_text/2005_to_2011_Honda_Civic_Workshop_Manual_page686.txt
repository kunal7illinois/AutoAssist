Shift Control
The PCM instantly determines which gear should be selected by various signals
sent from the sensors and the switches, and actuates shift solenoid valves A, B, C,
and D to control gear selection.
The shift solenoid valves are a normally closed type. When a shift solenoid valve is
turned ON by the PCM, its port opens and the pressure from the shift solenoid valve
(s) moves to the shift valves. When a shift solenoid valve is turned OFF by the
PCM, its port closes, cutting off the pressure to the shift valves.
The combination of driving signals to shift solenoid valves A, B, C, and D and their
respective gear position are shown in the table.
