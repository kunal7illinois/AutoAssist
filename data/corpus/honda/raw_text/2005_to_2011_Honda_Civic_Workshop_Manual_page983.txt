4. Measure the ATF temperature sensor resistance between shift solenoid harness
connector terminals No. 6 and No. 7.
Standard: 50 ohms-25 kohms
5. If the resistance is out of standard, go to step 6, and replace the ATF
temperature sensor and solenoid harness. The ATF temperature sensor is not
available separately from the shift solenoid harness.
If the resistance is within the standard, the test is complete, connect the
connector securely, and install the splash shield.
6. Remove the drain plug (A), and drain the automatic transmission fluid (ATF).
