Partial Lock-up
As the speed of the vehicle reaches the programmed value, the PCM turns shift
solenoid valve D ON. Shift solenoid valve D pressure (SD) is applied to the right
end of the lock-up shift valve, which switches the pressure over to the torque
converter pressure port leading to the front of the torque converter. Torque
converter pressure (91) enters into the front of the torque converter to engage the
torque converter clutch piston. The PCM also controls A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valve A to regulate A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A pressure
(55), and A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A pressure (55) is applied to
the lock-up control valve. Torque converter pressure (94) drained from the back of
the torque converter is applied to the right side of the lock-up control valve, and
