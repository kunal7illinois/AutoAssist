37. Apply power steering fluid to the inside of the valve seal ring sizing tool. Set
the larger diameter end of the sizing tool over the valve seal ring, and move the
sizing tool up and down several times to make the valve seal ring fit in the
pinion shaft groove.
38. Remove the sizing tool, turn it over, slide the smaller diameter end over the
valve seal ring. Move it up and down several times to make the valve seal ring
fit snugly in the pinion shaft groove.
39. Apply power steering fluid to the surface of the sleeve seal ring guide. Slip two
new seal rings (A) over the ring guide from the smaller diameter end, and
expand them. Install only two rings at a time from each end of the pinion shaft
sleeve (B).
Note these items when installing the seal ring:
Do not over-expand the seal ring. Install the resin seal rings with care so
(cid:1)
as not to damage them. After installation, make sure you contract the seal
rings using the sizing tool.
There are two types of sleeve seal rings; black and brown. Do not mix the
(cid:1)
different types of rings as they are not compatible.
