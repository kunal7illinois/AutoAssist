GENERAL INFORMATION Trouble Shooting - Basic Procedures
Axle shaft noise is similar to gear noise and pinion bearing whine. Axle shaft
bearing noise will normally distinguish itself from gear noise by occurring in all
driving modes (Drive, cruise, coast and float), and will persist with transmission in
Neutral while vehicle is moving at problem speed.
If vehicle displays this noise condition, remove suspect parts, replace wheel seals
and install a new set of bearings. Re-evaluate vehicle for noise before removing any
internal components.
Vibration
Vibration is a high-frequency trembling, shaking or grinding condition (felt or
heard) that may be constant or variable in level and can occur during the total
operating speed range of the vehicle.
The types of vibrations that can be felt in the vehicle can d into 3 main groups:
Vibrations of various unbalanced rotating parts of the vehicle.
(cid:1)
Resonance vibrations of the body and frame structures caused by rotating of
(cid:1)
unbalanced parts.
Tip-in moans of resonance vibrations from stressed engine or exhaust system
(cid:1)
mounts or driveline flexing modes.
