12. Turn the mainshaft holder bolt (B) clockwise; stop turning when the dial gauge
has reached its maximum movement. The reading on the dial gauge is the
amount of mainshaft thrust clearance.
NOTE: Do not turn the mainshaft holder bolt more than 60
degrees after the needle of the dial gauge stops
moving. Applying more pressure with the mainshaft
holder bolt could damage the transmission.
13. If the reading is within the standard, the clearance is correct. If the reading is
not within the standard, select the appropriate shim needed from the table, and
recheck the thrust clearance.
Standard: 0.11-0.17 mm (0.004-0.007 in.)
(Example)
Measure reading: 1.93 mm (0.0759 in.)
Subtract the total clearance measurement from the middle of the clearance
standard 0.14 mm (0.0056 in.).
