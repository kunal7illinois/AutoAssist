2. Disconnect the 22P connector (B) from the power window master switch.
3. Check for continuity between the terminals in each switch position according
to Fig. 17, Fig. 18, Fig. 19 and Fig. 20 .
Driver's Switch (With AUTO UP/AUTO DOWN)
The driver's switch is combined with the control unit, so you cannot isolate the
switch to test it. Instead, run the master switch input test procedures (see 4-
DOOR WITH AUTO UP/AUTO DOWN FUNCTION ). If the tests are
normal, the driver's switch must be faulty. Replace the switch.
