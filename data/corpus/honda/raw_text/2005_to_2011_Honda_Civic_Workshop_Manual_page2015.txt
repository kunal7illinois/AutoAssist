2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 STEERING EPS System - Civic (All Except Hybrid & Si)
back-and-forth with the vehicle stopped, causes an increase of power consumption
in the EPS motor. The increase of electric current causes the motor to heat up.
Because this heat adversely affects the system, the control unit monitors the electric
current of the motor.
When the control unit detects heat build-up in the motor, it reduces the electric
current to the motor gradually to protect the system, and it restricts the power assist
operation. The EPS indicator does not come on during this function.
When steering torque is not applied to the steering wheel, or when the ignition is
turned off and the motor cools, the control unit will restore the power assist
gradually until it's fully restored (after about 8 minutes).
TORQUE SENSOR NEUTRAL POSITION
The EPS control unit stores the torque sensor neutral position in the EEPROM. The
torque sensor neutral position must be memorized whenever the gearbox, the motor,
or the EPS control unit is replaced.
NOTE: The torque sensor neutral position is not effected when
erasing the DTCs.
HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT DTCS
The troubleshooting procedures assume that the cause of the problem is still present
and the EPS indicator is still on. Following the procedure when the EPS indicator
does not come on can result in incorrect diagnosis.
1. Question the customer about the conditions when the problem occured, and try
to reproduce the same conditions for troubleshooting. Find out when the EPS
indicator came on, such as during EPS control, after EPS control, when the
vehicle was at a certain speed, etc.
2. When the EPS indicator does not come on during the test-drive, but
troubleshooting is done based on the DTC, check for loose connectors, poor
terminal contact, etc., in the affected circuit before you start troubleshooting.
3. After troubleshooting, clear the DTC and test-drive the vehicle. Be sure the
EPS indicator does not come on.
