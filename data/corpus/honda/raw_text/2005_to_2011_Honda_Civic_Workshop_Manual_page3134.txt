10. If the ignition timing differs from the specification, check the cam timing. If
the cam timing is OK, update the engine control module (ECM)/powertrain
control module (PCM) if it does not have the latest software (see UPDATING
ECM/PCM ), or substitute a known-good ECM/PCM (see SUBSTITUTING
THE ECM/PCM ), then recheck. If the system works properly, and the
ECM/PCM was substituted, replace the original ECM/PCM (see ECM/PCM
REPLACEMENT ).
11. Disconnect the HDS and the timing light.
