RGB Color
This screen verifies that the navigation display is receiving the video (R, G, B and
Composite sync) signals properly. The three primary colors should all be shown
without distortion. The combination of all three should produce a central white
section. If the picture has lines in it, or scrolls horizontally or vertically, and any of
the colors are missing, troubleshoot for a Composite sync and color signal problem
