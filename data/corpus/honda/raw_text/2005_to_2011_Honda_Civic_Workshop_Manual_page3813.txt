FLUID REPLACEMENT
Check the reservoir (A) at regular intervals, and add the recommended fluid as
necessary. Always use Honda Power Steering Fluid. Use of any other type of power
steering fluid or automatic transmission fluid can cause increased wear and poor
steering in cold weather.
NOTE: If the fluid is contaminated, the screen in the reservoir may
be partially blocked. Replace the reservoir if necessary.
