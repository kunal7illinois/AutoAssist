GA-NET BUS CONFIGURATION
The GA-Net bus passes audio and navigation commands throughout the navigation
and audio components. These commands include navigation touch screen and hard
button signals, audio/XM selections by voice, and XM station and music title
names. Because the entire bus is daisy chained between components (see diagram),
any open or short in the GA-Net bus harness will cause any or all of these functions
to become inoperative. Naturally the addition of any audio accessory must maintain
the continuity of the GA-Net bus by installing the Y cable included with the
accessory kit.
