on-board snapshot, and review the general
troubleshooting information (see GENERAL
TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION ).
Fresh fuel has a higher volatility that will create greater
(cid:1)
pressure/vacuum. The optimum condition for testing is
less than a full tank of fresh fuel. If possible, to assist in
leak detection, add 1 gallon of fresh fuel to the tank (as

procedures.
1. Check the fuel fill cap (the cap must say "TIGHTEN TO CLICK"). It should
turn 1/4 turn after it's tight, then it clicks.

2. Check the fuel fill cap seal (A) and the fuel fill pipe mating surface (B). Verify
that the fuel fill cap tether cord (C) is not caught under the cap.
