REGULATOR VALVE BODY DISASSEMBLY, INSPECTION, AND REASSEMBLY
1. Clean all parts thoroughly in solvent, and dry them with compressed air. Blow
out all passages except the air check valve filter.
2. Inspect the regulator valve body for scoring and damage.
3. Hold the regulator spring cap in place while removing the stop bolt. The
regulator spring cap is spring loaded. Once the stop bolt is removed, release the
spring cap slowly so it does not pop out.
4. Check all valves for free movement. If any fail to slide freely, refer to VALVE
BODY REPAIR .
5. Check the air check valve filter for clogging. If the filter is clogged, remove the
air check valve, and clean the filter thoroughly by pouring clean ATF. Do not
blow out the filter with compressed air. Replace the air check valve, if the filter
or check valve (ball) is clogged or damaged.
6. Coat all parts with ATF during assembly.
7. Align the hole in the regulator spring cap with the stop bolt hole, then press the
spring cap into the valve body, and tighten the stop bolt.
