of these functions to become inoperative. The addition of any factory audio
accessory must maintain the continuity of the GA-Net bus by installing the Y cable
included with the accessory kit.

Yaw Rate Sensor
The yaw rate sensor (located in the navigation unit) detects the direction change
(angular speed) of the vehicle. The sensor is an oscillation gyro built into the
navigation unit.
Sensor Element Structure
The sensor element is shaped like a tuning fork, and it consists of the piezoelectric
parts, the metal block, and the support pin. There are four piezoelectric parts: one to
drive the oscillators, one to monitor and maintain the oscillation at a regular
frequency, and two to detect angular velocity. The two oscillators, which have a 90-
degree twist in the center, are connected at the bottom by the metal block and
supported by the support pin. A detection piezoelectric part is attached to the top of
each oscillator. The driving piezoelectric part is attached to the bottom of one
oscillator, and the monitoring piezoelectric part is attached to the bottom of the
other oscillator.
Oscillation Gyro Principles
The piezoelectric parts have electric/mechanical transfer characteristics. They bend
vertically when voltage is applied to both sides of the parts, and voltage is generated
between both sides of the piezoelectric parts when they are bent by an external
force. The oscillation gyro functions by utilizing this characteristic of the
piezoelectric parts and Coriolis force. (Coriolis force deflects moving objects as a
result of the earth's rotation.) In the oscillation gyro, this force moves the sensor
