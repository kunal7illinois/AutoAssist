2008 Honda Civic EX
2006-08 ACCESSORIES & EQUIPMENT Navigation System - Civic (Except Hybrid)
A sensor output voltage HIGHER than the Offset voltage indicates that the
vehicle is turning to the left.
The yaw rate offset and sensor should both indicate about 2.500 V when
(cid:1)
stopped. If either reads zero or 5.000 V, replace the navigation unit.
The yaw rate offset and sensor should be within +/- 0.01 V of each other when
(cid:1)
stopped. The sensor value should change relative to the offset as the car is
turned while driving. If not, replace the navigation unit.
Example: Vehicle stopped

instructions from the factory. See next paragraph for
