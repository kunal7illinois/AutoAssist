The PCM controls the shift solenoid valves and the A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valves. The conditions of the shift solenoid valves and the position of the
shift valves are as follows:
Shift solenoid valve A is turned ON, causing shift valve A to move to the left
(cid:1)
side.
Shift solenoid valve B is turned OFF, keeping shift valve B on the right side.
(cid:1)
Shift solenoid valve C is turned OFF, keeping shift valve C on the left side.
