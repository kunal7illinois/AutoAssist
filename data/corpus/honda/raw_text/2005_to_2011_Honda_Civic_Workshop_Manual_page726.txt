P Position
The manual valve is moved into the P position, line pressure (1) becomes line
pressure (1), (3), and (7) at the manual valve. The PCM turns shift solenoid valve D
ON, and shift solenoid valves A, B, and C OFF. Shift solenoid valve D pressure
(SD) is applied to the left end of shift valve D, and shift valve D is moved to the
right side to uncover line pressure (3) port leading to the servo valve. Line pressure
(3') from shift valve D flows to the servo valve, and pushes the servo valve to the
reverse position. Line pressure (1) is intercepted at cut valve B, line pressure (1B) is
intercepted at shift valve B, and hydraulic pressure is not applied to the clutches.
NOTE: When used, "left" or "right" indicates direction on the
hydraulic circuit.
