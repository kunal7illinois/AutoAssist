Fig. 58: Applying Assembly Paste To Pad Side Of Shims And Brake Pads
13. Install the brake pads and pad shims correctly. Install the brake pad with the
wear indicator (C) on the bottom inside. If you are reusing the brake pads,
always reinstall the brake pads in their original positions to prevent a
temporary loss of braking efficiency.
14. Rotate the caliper piston (A) clockwise into the cylinder, then align the cutout
(B) in the piston with the tab (C) on the inner pad by turning the piston back.
Lubricate the boot with rubber grease to avoid twisting the piston boot. If the
piston boot is twisted, back it out so it is positioned properly.
NOTE: Be careful when moving the piston back in the caliper;
brake fluid might overflow from the master cylinder's
reservoir.
