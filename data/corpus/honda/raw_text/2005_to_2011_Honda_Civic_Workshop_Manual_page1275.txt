GENERAL INFORMATION Trouble Shooting - Basic Procedures
Defective CV/universal joints may cause clicking noises or excessive driveline play
that can be improperly diagnosed as drive axle problems.
Trim and moldings also can cause a whistling or whining noise. Ensure none of
these components are causing the noise before disassembling the drive axle.
Gear Noise
A "howling" or "whining" noise from the ring and pinion gear can be caused by an
improper gear pattern, gear damage, or improper bearing preload. It can occur at
various speeds and driving conditions, or it can be continuous.
Before disassembling axle to diagnose and correct gear ke sure that tires, exhaust,
and vehicle trim have been checked as possible causes.
Chuckle
This is a particular rattling noise that sounds like a stick against the spokes of a
spinning bicycle wheel. It occurs while decelerating from 40 MPH and usually can
be heard until vehicle comes to a complete stop. The frequency varies with the
speed of the vehicle.
A chuckle that occurs on the driving phase is usually caused ive clearance due to
differential gear wear, or by a damaged tooth on the coast side of the pinion or ring
gear. Even a very small tooth nick or a ridge on the edge of a gear tooth is enough
the cause the noise.
This condition can be corrected simply by cleaning the gear tooth nick or ridge with
a small grinding wheel. If either gear is damaged or scored badly, the gear set must
be replaced. If metal has broken loose, the carrier and housing must be cleaned to
remove particles that could cause damage.
Knock
This is very similar to a chuckle, though it may be louder, and occur on acceleration
or deceleration. Knock can be caused by a gear tooth that is damaged on the drive
side of the ring and pinion gears. Ring gear bolts that are hitting the carrier casting
can cause knock. Knock can also be due to excessive end play in the axle shafts.
