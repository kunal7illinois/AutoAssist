CYLINDER BORE HONING
Only a scored or scratched cylinder bore must be honed.
1. Measure the cylinder bores (see BLOCK AND PISTON INSPECTION ). If
the engine block is to be reused, hone the cylinders, and remeasure the bores.
2. Remove and replace the oil jets (see OIL JET REPLACEMENT ).
3. Hone the cylinder bores with honing oil and a fine (400 grit) stone.
Honing Pattern: Within 30-60 degree cross-hatch pattern (A)
NOTE: Use only a rigid hone with 400 grit or finer stone such
as Sunnen, Ammco, or equivalent. Do not use stones
that are worn or broken.
