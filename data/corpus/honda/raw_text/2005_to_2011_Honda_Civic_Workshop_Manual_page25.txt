2006-08 BRAKES ABS System - Civic (All Except Hybrid)
EBD FEATURES
The electronic brake distribution (EBD) feature helps control vehicle braking by
adjusting the rear brake force in accordance with the rear wheel load before the
ABS operates. Based on the wheel sensor signals, the control unit uses the
modulator to control the rear brakes individually. When the rear wheel speed is less
than the front wheel speed, the ABS modulator-control unit retains the current rear
brake fluid pressure by closing the inlet valve in the modulator. As the rear wheel
speed increases and approaches the front wheel speed, the ABS modulator-control
unit increases the rear brake fluid pressure by momentarily opening the inlet valve.
This whole process is repeated very rapidly. While this is happening, there is
kickback at the brake pedal.

MODULATOR UNIT
The ABS modulator consists of the inlet solenoid valve, the outlet solenoid valve,
the reservoir, the pump, the pump motor, and the damping chamber. The modulator
reduces the caliper fluid pressure directly. It is a circulating-type modulator because
the brake fluid circulates through the caliper, the reservoir, and the master cylinder.
The hydraulic control has three modes; pressure intensifying, pressure retaining,
and pressure reducing. The hydraulic circuit is an independent four channel type;
one channel for each wheel.
