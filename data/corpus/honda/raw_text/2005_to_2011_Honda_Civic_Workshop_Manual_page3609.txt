element when angular velocity is applied.
Operation
1. The driving piezoelectric part oscillates the oscillator by repeatedly bending
and returning when an AC voltage of 6 kHz is applied to the part, The
monitoring-side oscillator resonates because it is connected to the driving-side
oscillator by the metal block.
2. The monitoring piezoelectric part bends in proportion to the oscillation and
outputs voltage (the monitor signal). The navigation unit control circuit
controls the drive signal to stabilize the monitor signal.
3. When the vehicle is stopped, the detecting piezoelectric parts oscillate right
and left with the oscillators, but no signal is output because the parts are not
bent (no angular force).
4. When the vehicle turns to the right, the sensor element moves in a circular
motion with the right oscillator bending forward and the left oscillator bending
rearward. The amount of forward/rearward bend varies according to the
angular velocity of the vehicle.
5. The detecting piezoelectric parts output voltage (the yaw rate signal) according
to the amount of bend. The amount of vehicle direction change is determined
by measuring this voltage.
