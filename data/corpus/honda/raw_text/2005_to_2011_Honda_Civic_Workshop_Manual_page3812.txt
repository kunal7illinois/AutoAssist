Fig. 9: Identifying Shut-Off Valve - P/S Pressure Gauge
9. Start the engine, and let it idle.
10. Turn the steering wheel from lock-to-lock several times to warm the fluid to
operating temperature at 158°F (70°C).
11. Measure steady-state fluid pressure while the engine is idling. If the pump is in
2
good condition, the gauge should be no more than 1,470 kPa (15 kgf/cm , 213
psi). If it reads higher, check for:
Clogged or deformed pump outlet or return line between the pump and the
(cid:1)
steering gearbox.
Clogged valve body unit.
(cid:1)
12. Raise the engine speed to 3,000 rpm, and measure the fluid pressure. If the
pump is in good condition, the gauge should read at least 1,470 kPa (15
2
kgf/cm , 213 psi). If it reads higher, repair or replace the pump.
13. Lower the engine speed, and let it idle. Close the shut-off valve gradually until
the pressure gauge needle is stable. Read the pressure.
NOTE: Do not keep the shut-off valve closed more than 5
seconds or the pump could be damaged by
overheating.
14. Immediately open the shut-off valve fully. If the pump is in good condition, the
2
gauge should read at least 7,850-8,550 kPa (80-87 kgf/cm , 1,140-1,240 psi).
