A/C COMPRESSOR REPLACEMENT
R18A1 ENGINE
NOTE: Do not install an A/C compressor into a system unless you
are completely sure that the system is free of
contamination. Installing the A/C compressor into a
contaminated system can result in premature A/C
compressor failure.
1. If the A/C compressor is marginally operable, run the engine at idle speed, and
let the air conditioning work for a few minutes, then shut the engine off.
2. Recover the refrigerant with a recovery/recycling/charging station (see
REFRIGERANT RECOVERY ).
3. Make sure you have the anti-theft code for the audio or navigation system, then
write down the audio presets.
4. Remove the front grille cover (see FRONT GRILLE COVER
REPLACEMENT ) and the alternator (see ALTERNATOR REMOVAL
AND INSTALLATION ).
5. Disconnect the connector (A) from the A/C condenser fan motor. Remove the
wire harness clip (B) and the connector clip (C). Remove the upper mounting
bolts, and the A/C condenser fan shroud (D). Be careful not to damage the
radiator fins when removing the A/C condenser fan shroud.
