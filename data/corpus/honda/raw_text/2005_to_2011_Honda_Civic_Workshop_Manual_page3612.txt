sensor and the travel distance signals from the PCMs vehicle speed pulse (VSP)
signal.
Map Matching Tuning
The map matching tuning is accomplished by indicating the vehicle position on the
roads on the map. The map data transmitted from the DVD-ROM is checked
against the vehicle position data, and the vehicle position is indicate on the nearest
road. Map matching tuning does not occur when the vehicle travels on a road not
shown on the map, or when the vehicle position is far away from a road on the map.
GPS Tuning
The GPS tuning is accomplished by indicating the vehicle position as the GPS's
vehicle position. The navigation unit compares its calculated vehicle position data
with the GPS vehicle position data. If there is large difference between the two, the
indicated vehicle position is adjusted to the GPS vehicle position.
Distance Tuning
The distance tuning reduces the difference between the travel distance signal from
the VSP and the distance data on the map. The navigation unit compares its
calculated vehicle position data with the GPS vehicle position data. The navigation
unit then decreases the tuning value when the vehicle position is always ahead of
the GPS vehicle position, and it increases the tuning value when the vehicle
position is always behind the GPS vehicle position.
Route Guidance
The navigation unit can calculate different routes to a selected destination. You
have five options:
Direct Route - Calculate a route that is the most direct.
(cid:1)
Easy Route - Calculate a route that minimizes the number of turns needed.
(cid:1)
Minimize Freeways - Calculate a route that avoids freeway travel. If that is not
(cid:1)
possible, keep the amount of freeway travel to a minimum.
Minimize Toll Roads - Calculate a route that avoids, or minimizes travel on
(cid:1)
toll roads.
