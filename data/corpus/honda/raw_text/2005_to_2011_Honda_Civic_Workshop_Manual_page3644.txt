ICON IS WHITE OR NOT SHOWN).

2. Go into the Diagnostic Menu, and use the Yaw Rate test (see YAW RATE) to
check the yaw rate sensor.
3. Go into the Diagnostic Menu and use the Car Status test (see CAR STATUS)
to check the vehicle speed pulse.
Are the yaw rate sensor and vehicle speed pulse OK?
YES -The problem may be a normal characteristic. Check to see if the problem
occurs in the same place. If it does, the problem could be in the database.
Compare to a known-good vehicle under the same conditions. If you can
duplicate the problem, report it. Refer to the Customer Assistance section of
the Navigation User's Guide, "Reporting Errors".
NO -If the problem is the yaw rate sensor, replace the navigation unit (see
NAVIGATION UNIT REMOVAL/INSTALLATION). If the problem is the
vehicle speed pulse, troubleshoot the vehicle speed signal circuit.
