ODS UNIT INITIALIZATION
When a seat-back cover, seat-back cushion, and/or ODS unit is replaced, initialize
the ODS by following the procedure.
NOTE: A new (uninitialized) ODS unit installed with a faulty OPDS
sensor can cause DTC 85-71.
1. Clear the DTC memory (see CLEAR THE DTC MEMORY WITH THE
HDS).
2. Make sure the front passenger's seat is dry. Set the seat-back in a normal
position, and make sure there is nothing on the seat.
3. Make sure the ignition switch is OFF and the MES connector is not shorted.
4. Connect the HDS to the data link connector (DLC) (A).

5. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
6. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the SRS unit. If it does
not communicate, troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT
TROUBLESHOOTING ).
7. From the HDS Main Menu, select SRS, then SRS, then Adjustments. In the
Adjustment Menu, select ODS INIT. Follow the screen prompts to initialize
the ODS unit.
