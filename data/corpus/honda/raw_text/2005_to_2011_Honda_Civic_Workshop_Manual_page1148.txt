surface, always rotate it by holding its circumference.
4. Read the dial indicator. The dial indicator reads the phase difference (E) of the
wave-plate between the bottom and top.
Standard: 0.07-0.20 mm (0.003-0.008 in.)
5. Rotate the 1st clutch wave-plate about 67-degrees or 56-degrees from the top,
and rotate the 3rd and 5th clutch wave-plate about 60-degrees. The dial
indicator should be at the bottom of a phase difference (F and G), and zero the
dial indicator.
6. Measure the phase difference at the other two tops (H and I) of the wave-plate
by following steps 3 thru 5.
7. If the two values of the three measurements are within the standard, the wave-
plate is OK. If the two values of the three measurements are out of the
standard, replace the wave-plate.
CLUTCH CLEARANCE INSPECTION
Special Tools Required
Clutch compressor attachment 07ZAE-PRP0100
1. Inspect the clutch piston, discs, plates, and the end-plate for wear and damage
(see CLUTCH INSPECTION ), and inspect the clutch wave-plate phase
difference (see CLUTCH WAVE-PLATE PHASE DIFFERENCE
INSPECTION ), if necessary.
2. Install the clutch pistons in the clutch drums. Do not install the O-rings during
inspection.
