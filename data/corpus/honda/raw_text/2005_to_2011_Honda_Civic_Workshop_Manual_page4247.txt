Fig. 4: Identifying Steering Wheel Rotational Play
POWER ASSIST CHECK
NOTE: This test should be done with original equipment tires and
wheels at the correct tire pressure.
1. For the power steering type, check the power steering fluid level (see FLUID
REPLACEMENT ).
2. Start the engine, let it idle, and turn the steering wheel from lock-to-lock
several times to warm up the component and the fluid (power steering type).
3. Attach a commercially available spring scale to the steering wheel. With the
engine idling and the vehicle on a clean, dry floor, pull the scale as shown and
read it as soon as the tires begin to turn.
If the scale reads no more than the specification, the steering gearbox and
(cid:1)
pump are OK.
For the power steering type, if the scale reads more than specifications,
(cid:1)
troubleshoot the steering system (see SYMPTOM
TROUBLESHOOTING )
For the EPS type, if the scale reads more than specifications, check for
(cid:1)
steering linkage (see STEERING LINKAGE AND GEARBOX
INSPECTION ), and check the rack guide adjustment (see EPS TYPE ).
Initial turning load: 34 N (3.5 kgf, 7.7 lbf)
