2006-08 MAINTENANCE Maintenance - Civic GX

5. If the indicated maintenance is not done, the engine oil life indicator shows a
negative mileage, for example "-10," on the display.
If the negative mileage is between 0 and -9, the indicator is displayed for only
a few seconds when the ignition switch is turned to the ON (II) position. The
negative mileage remains displayed after the vehicle is driven more than 10
miles after 0 % oil life is reached.
This means the indicated maintenance item(s) should have been done more
than 10 miles ago.

Resetting the Maintenance Information Display
NOTE:
The vehicle must be stopped to reset the display.
(cid:1)
If a required service is done and the display is not reset,
(cid:1)
or if the maintenance display is reset without doing the
service, the system will not show the proper
maintenance timing. This can lead to serious
mechanical problems because there will be no accurate
record of when the required maintenance is needed.
1. Turn the ignition switch to the ON (II) position.
2. Press the SEL/RESET button repeatedly until the engine oil life indicator is
displayed.
