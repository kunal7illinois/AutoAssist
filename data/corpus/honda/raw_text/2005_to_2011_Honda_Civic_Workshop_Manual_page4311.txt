System Outline
This system is composed of the VSA modulator-control unit, the wheel speed
sensor, the steering angle sensor, and the yaw rate-lateral acceleration sensor, and
the system indicators in the gauge control module (tach). The VSA modulator-
control unit controls the ABS, EBD, TCS, VSA, and brake assist with the brake
pressure of each wheel and the engine torque.
