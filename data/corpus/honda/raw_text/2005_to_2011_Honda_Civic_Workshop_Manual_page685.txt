Electronic Control
The electronic control system consists of the powertrain control module (PCM),
sensors, and seven solenoid valves. Shifting and lock-up are electronically
controlled for comfortable driving under all conditions.
The PCM receives input signals from the sensors, switches, and other control units,
processes data, and outputs signals for the engine control system and A/T control
system. The A/T control system includes shift control, grade logic control, clutch
pressure control, and lock-up control. The PCM switches the shift solenoid valves
and the A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves to control shifting transmission
gears and lock-up torque converter clutch.
