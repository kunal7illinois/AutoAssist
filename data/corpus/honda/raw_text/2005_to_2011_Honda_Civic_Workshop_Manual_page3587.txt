After service, reconnect power to the navigation unit, and turn the ignition switch
ON (II). Enter the 4-digit anti-theft security codes, then select Done.
If the code cannot be found, use the interactive Network (i N) to look it up. You can
view the serial number in one of the Navi ECU diagnostic screen (see TOUCH
PANEL CALIBRATION). Alternatively, you will need the serial number from the
navigation unit in the dash.
When replacing the navigation unit, be sure to give the customer the new anti-theft
security code.
SYMPTOM DIAGNOSIS
Certain circumstances and system limitations will result in occasional vehicle
positioning errors. Some customers may think this indicates a problem with the
navigation system when, in fact, the system is normal. Keep the following items in
mind when interviewing customers about symptoms of the navigation system.
SELF-INERTIAL NAVIGATION LIMITATIONS
The limitations of the self-inertial portion of the navigation system (the yaw rate
sensor and the vehicle speed signal) can cause some discrepancies between the
vehicle's actual position and the indicated vehicle position (GPS vehicle position).
The following circumstances may cause vehicle positioning errors:
Moving the vehicle with the engine stopped and the vehicle stopped, such as
(cid:1)
by ferry or tow truck, or if the vehicle is spun on a turn table.
Tire slippage, changes in tire rolling diameters, and some driving situations
(cid:1)
may cause discrepancies in travel distances. Examples of this include:
Continuous tire slippage on a slippery surface.
(cid:2)
Driving with snow chains mounted.
