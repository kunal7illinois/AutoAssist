(see step 2 on HOW TO USE THE HDS (HONDA DIAGNOSTIC
SYSTEM) ).
9. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
10. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the engine control

the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
11. Jump the SCS line with the HDS, then turn the ignition to LOCK (0).
NOTE: This step must be done to protect the ECM/PCM from
damage.
12. Disconnect ECM/PCM connector B (44P).
13. Check for continuity between ECM/PCM connector terminal B42 and body
ground.
