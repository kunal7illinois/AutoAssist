Touch Panel Check
The panel touch sensing system consists of a touch sensitive resistive membrane
covering the display. Contrary to other systems using infrared beams, the screen has
to be physically touched to make it work. The display has the capability of 479
touch locations (left to right), and 233 touch locations (top to bottom). The upper
left hand corner is position (0, 0) and the lower right hand corner is (479, 233) as
displayed. Touching anywhere on the screen will display the coordinate of the
location, and cause the place you touch to display a + icon. If any area of the screen
either doesn't respond, or responds at some other location when touched, then
replace the navigation unit.
NOTE: Unlike earlier screens that used infrared sensors, direct
sunlight will not affect this test.
