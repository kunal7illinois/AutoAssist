to the servo valve. Line pressure (3') from shift valve D flows to the servo valve,
and pushes the servo valve to the reverse position. The PCM controls A/T clutch
pressure control solenoid valve A to regulate A/T clutch pressure control solenoid
valve A pressure (55), and A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A pressure
(55) flows to the lock-up shift valve, shift valve B, the manual valve, the servo
valve, shift valve D, and cut valve A. A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A
pressure (3C) becomes 5th clutch pressure (50) at cut valve A. 5th clutch pressure
(50) is applied to the 5th clutch, and the 5th clutch is engaged by the A/T clutch
pressure control solenoid valve A pressure mode.
NOTE: When used, "left" or "right" indicates direction on the
