1. A front impact sensor must activate and send electric signals to the
microprocessor.
2. The microprocessor must compute the signals and send them to the airbag
inflator(s).
3. The inflators that receives signals must ignite and deploy the airbags.
Side Airbag(s)
1. Aside impact sensor must activate and send electric signals to the
microprocessor.
2. The microprocessor must compute the signals and send them to the side airbag
inflator(s). However, the microprocessor cuts off the signals to the front
passenger's side airbag if the SRS unit determines that the front passenger's
head is in the deployment path of the side airbag.
3. The inflator that receives the signal must ignite and deploy the side airbag.
Side Curtain Airbag(s)
1. Side impact sensor or the rear safing sensor must activate, and send electrical
signals to the microprocessor.

airbag and side airbag at the same time.
