2006-08 ACCESSORIES & EQUIPMENT Navigation System - Civic (Except Hybrid)
use a vehicle of the same model, year, trim, and software version. If you can
duplicate the symptom in the known-good vehicle, then it is a characteristic of
the system.
When the symptom can be duplicated, follow the self-diagnostic procedures
(cid:1)
and the appropriate troubleshooting procedures.
When the symptom does not reappear or only reappears intermittently, ask the
(cid:1)
customer about the conditions when the symptom occurred.
Try to establish if outside interference may be the cause.
(cid:2)
Try to duplicate the symptom under the same conditions the customer
(cid:2)
experienced.
Vibration, temperature extremes, and moisture (dew, humidity) are factors
(cid:2)
that are difficult to duplicate.
Inspect the vehicle for after market electronic devices (vehicle locators,
(cid:2)
radar detector amps, etc.) that may be hidden.
NOTE: When troubleshooting navigation system problems, ensure
that the known-good vehicle is the same software version
year and model as the vehicle being serviced. Mixing
incompatible navigation DVDs or other system components
can delay the troubleshooting process by causing effects
unrelated to the original problem.
SERVICE PRECAUTIONS
If the navigation unit needs to be replaced, inform the client that personal
(cid:1)
information in the navigation system may be lost. If possible, have the
customer record any personal information before the unit is replaced. On '07-
08 models, you can back up the navigation data and transfer it to a new
navigation unit. See SAVE USER'S MEMORY .
Before disconnecting the battery, make sure you have the anti-theft codes for
(cid:1)
the audio and navigation systems, and write down the audio presets.
Also obtain any PGM-FI or transmission DTCs and freeze frame date (which
will be lost when the ECM/PCM loses power).
