Shift Control - Grade Logic Control
The grade logic control system has been adopted to control shifting in D. To control
shifting while the vehicle is ascending or descending a slope, the PCM compares
actual driving conditions with programmed driving conditions, based on the input
from the accelerator pedal position sensor, the throttle position sensor, the engine
coolant temperature sensor, the barometric pressure sensor, the brake pedal position
switch signal, and the shift lever position signal.
