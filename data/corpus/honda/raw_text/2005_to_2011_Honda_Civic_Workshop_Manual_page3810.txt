If the pump is in good condition, the gauge should read at least 7,850-8,550
2
kPa (80-87 kgf/cm , 1,140-1,240 psi). A low reading means pump output is
too low for full assist. Repair or replace the pump.
16. Reinstall all removed parts.

Check the fluid pressure as follows to determine whether the trouble is in the pump
or the steering gearbox.
1. Check the power steering fluid level (see FLUID REPLACEMENT ).
2. Remove the cowl cover and under-cowl panel (see FRONT GRILLE
COVER REPLACEMENT ).
3. Remove the pump outlet hose clamp (A) from the intake manifold.
