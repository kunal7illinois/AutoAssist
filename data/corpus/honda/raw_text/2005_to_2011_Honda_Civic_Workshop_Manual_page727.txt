Lock-up System
The lock-up mechanism of the torque converter clutch operates in D (2nd, 3rd, 4th,
and 5th gears) and D3 (2nd and 3rd gears). The pressurized fluid is drained from the
back of the torque converter through a fluid passage, causing the torque converter
clutch piston to be held against the torque converter cover. As this takes place, the
mainshaft rotates at the same speed as the engine crankshaft. Together with the
hydraulic control, the PCM optimizes the timing and the amount of ATF the lock-
up mechanism receives. When shift solenoid valve D is turned on by the PCM, shift
solenoid valve D pressure turns the lock-up shift valve lock-up on and off. A/T
clutch pressure control solenoid valve A and the lock-up control valve control the
volume of lock-up.
