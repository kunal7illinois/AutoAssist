This screen looks for problems with the navigation unit. When you initiate this
diagnostic, the navigation unit may delay up to a minute while the diagnostic runs.
If V-RAM or D-RAM is NG, then replace the navigation unit.
(cid:1)
If GPS indicates NG (ANT), then check the entire GPS antenna wire from the
(cid:1)
navigation unit to the antenna. If the wire is crushed or damaged, try a known-
good antenna. If this diagnostic reads OK, then order a new GPS antenna. If
the diagnostic still reads NG (ANT), then replace the navigation unit.
DVD ROM represents the database version on the DVD. You can also find this
(cid:1)
information in setup by selecting System Information.
Serial No. should be the same as the serial number found on the underside of
(cid:1)
the navigation unit. You need this number to obtain the security code from the
Interactive Network system.
Mem Clear is for factory use, and should never be used unless instructed by the
(cid:1)
factory. Accidental selection will erase the customer's personal data, PINS, and
settings. If selected, a popup box appears asking if you want to clear the
memory. If so, select Yes.
