How to Troubleshoot Circuits at the ECM Connectors
NOTE: The ECM overwrites data and monitors the EVAP system
for up to 15 minutes after the ignition switch is turned to
OFF. Jumping the SCS line after turning the ignition switch
to LOCK (0) cancels this function. Disconnecting the ECM
during this function, without jumping the SCS line first, can
damage the ECM.
1. Jump the SCS line with the HDS.
2. Remove the cover (A).
