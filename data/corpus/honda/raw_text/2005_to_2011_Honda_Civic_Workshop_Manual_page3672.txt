TIRE CALIBRATION
As the vehicle moves, the navigation system receives speed pulses from the
ECM/PCM. These pulses are converted using a conversion factor to a mph speed
that moves the vehicle position (VP) on the map. The navigation system has an
internal tuning function that generates and refines this factor based on actual
driving. The Level indicates the status of the tuning. At navigation initialization, it
begins at 0, and increases to 10 as the navigation system is used.
The Auto Tuning is factory set to ON, and should remain on.
