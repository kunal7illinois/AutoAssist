8. Turn the ignition switch OFF, and wait for 10 seconds.
9. Turn the ignition switch ON (II) again. If the SRS indicator comes on for 6
seconds, and then goes off, the system is OK.
TROUBLESHOOTING INTERMITTENT FAILURES
If there was a malfunction, but it does not recur, it will be stored in the memory as
an intermittent failure, and the SRS indicator may come on depending on this
malfunction detected.
NOTE: Check the condition of the battery (see BATTERY (EXCEPT
HYBRID) ) and the charging system (see CHARGING
SYSTEM INDICATOR CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ). Low
battery voltage may cause some intermittent failures.
After checking the DTC, troubleshoot as follows:
1. Make sure the ignition switch is OFF:
2. Connect the HDS to the data link connector (DLC) (A).
3. Turn the ignition switch ON (II).
4. Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the SRS unit. If it does
not communicate, troubleshoot the DLC circuit (see DLC CIRCUIT
TROUBLESHOOTING ).
5. In the SRS MENU on the HDS, select SRS, then DTC to clear DTC(s).
6. Read the DTC (see "READING THE DTC").
7. Clear the DTC memory (see "CLEAR THE DTC MEMORY").
8. Set the parking brake, then start the engine, and let it idle.
9. The SRS indicator comes on for about 6 seconds and then goes off.
10. Shake the related wire harnesses and the connectors, and look for loose
connections, poor pinfits, and poor grounds.
11. Take a test-drive (quick acceleration, quick braking, and cornering), turn the
steering wheel fully left and right, and hold it there for 5 to 10 seconds. If the
problem recurs, the SRS indicator will come on.
