Fig. 2: Identifying System Indicator
When the system is OK, each indicator comes on for about 2 seconds after turning
the ignition switch ON (II), then goes off.
When the system detects a problem, a DTC will be set and, depending upon the
failure, the VSA modulator-control unit will determine which indicator(s) will be
turned on. If the problem goes away (system returns to normal), the indicator(s) will
be controlled in the following way depending upon the DTC that was set:
The indicator(s) will come on and stay on when the ignition switch is ON (II).
(cid:1)
The indicator(s) will automatically go off.
(cid:1)
The indicator(s) will go off after the vehicle is driven.

ABS Indicator
The ABS indicator comes on when the ABS function is lost. The brakes still work
like a conventional system.
Brake System indicator
The brake system indicator comes on when the EBD function is lost, the parking
brake is applied, and/or the brake fluid level is low.
NOTE: If two or more wheel speed sensors fail, the brake system
indicator will come on.
