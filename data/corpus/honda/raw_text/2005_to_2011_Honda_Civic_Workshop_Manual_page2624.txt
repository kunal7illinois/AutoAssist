INSPECTION
1. Reassemble all the parts, except for the upper spring mounting cushion, the
bump stop, and the damper spring.
2. Compress the damper assembly by hand, and check for smooth operation
through a full stroke, both compression and extension. The damper should
extend smoothly and constantly when compression is released. If it does not,
the gas is leaking and the damper should be replaced.

REASSEMBLY
