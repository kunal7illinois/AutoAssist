BRAKE FLUID LEVEL SWITCH TEST
Check for continuity between the terminals (1) and (2) with the float in the down
position and in the up position.
NOTE:
Remove the brake fluid completely from the reservoir.
(cid:1)
With the float down, there should be continuity.
Fill the reservoir with brake fluid to the MAX (upper)
(cid:1)
level (A). With the float up, there should be no
continuity.
If both the ABS indicator and the brake system
(cid:1)
indicator come on at same time, check the ABS or VSA
system first: ABS (see GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING
INFORMATION ), VSA (see GENERAL
TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION ).
If the parking brake switch and fluid level switch are
(cid:1)
OK, but brake system indicator does not function,
check the ABS or VSA system: ABS (see GENERAL
TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION ), VSA (see
GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION ).
