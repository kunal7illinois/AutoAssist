NOTE:
The "x" at the end of each DTC denotes a numeric character (0 thru 9) or an alpha character (A thru
F) that you will see on the HDS display. The character is unrelated to your troubleshooting; it
designates the SRS unit manufacturer and other detail used for product analysis.
(1) The SRS indicator turns on and stays on whenever the ignition switch is in
the ON (II) position, or until the code is cleared
(2) The SRS indicator turns on when the DTC is set. The SRS indicator will
not turn on after the ignition switch is cycled from ON (II) to OFF (0), but
the DTC is stored in the SRS unit
