The valve body includes the main valve body, the regulator valve body, and the
servo body. The ATF pump is driven by splines on the end of the torque converter
which is attached to the engine. Fluid flows through the regulator valve to maintain
specified pressure through the main valve body to the manual valve, directing
pressure to each of the clutches. Shift solenoid valves A, B, C, and D are mounted
on the servo body. A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C are
mounted on the transmission housing.
