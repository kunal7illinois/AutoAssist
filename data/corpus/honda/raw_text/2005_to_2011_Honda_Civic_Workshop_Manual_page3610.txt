2006-08 ACCESSORIES & EQUIPMENT Navigation System - Civic (Except Hybrid)
The global positioning system (GPS) enables the navigation system to determine
the current position of the vehicle by using the signals transmitted from the
satellites in orbit around the earth. The satellites transmit the satellite identification
signal, orbit information, transmission time signal, and other information. When the
GPS receiver receives a signal from four or more satellites simultaneously, it
calculates the current position of the vehicle based on the distance to each satellite
and the satellite's positions in its respective orbit.
