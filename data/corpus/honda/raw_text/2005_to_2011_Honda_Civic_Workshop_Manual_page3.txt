DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE (DTC)
The memory can hold all DTCs. However, when the same DTC is detected
(cid:1)
more than once, the more recent DTC is written over the earlier one. Therefore,
when the same problem is detected repeatedly, it is memorized as a single
DTC.
The DTCs are indicated in the order they occur.
(cid:1)
The DTCs are memorized in the EEPROM. Therefore, the memorized DTCs
(cid:1)
cannot be canceled by disconnecting the battery. Do the specified procedures
to clear the DTCs.
SELF-DIAGNOSIS
Self-diagnosis can be classified into two categories:
(cid:1)
Initial diagnosis: Done right after the ignition switch is turned ON (II) and
(cid:2)
until the ABS indicator goes off.
Regular diagnosis: Done right after the initial diagnosis until the ignition
(cid:2)
switch is turned OFF.
When the system detects a problem, the ABS modulator-control unit shifts to
(cid:1)
fail-safe mode.
KICKBACK
The pump motor operates when the ABS modulator-control unit is functioning, and
the fluid in the reservoir is forced out to the master cylinder, causing kickback at the
brake pedal.
PUMP MOTOR
The pump motor operates when the ABS modulator-control unit is functioning.
(cid:1)
The ABS modulator-control unit checks the pump motor operation during
(cid:1)
regular diagnosis when the vehicle is driven over 10 mph (15 km/h) the first
time after the ignition switch is turned ON (II). You may hear the motor
operate at this time, but it is normal.
