25. Install a new gasket (C) on the transmission housing, and install the two dowel
pins (D) and new O-rings (E) over the top of the ATF feed pipes (F).
26. Install the end cover (G), and tighten the 17 bolts.
27. Set the selector control shaft (A) to the N position by turning the selector
control shaft on the torque converter side.
NOTE: Do not squeeze the end of the selector control shaft
tips together when turning the shaft. If the selector
control shaft tips are squeezed together it will cause a
faulty signal or position due to play between the
selector control shaft and the transmission range
switch.
