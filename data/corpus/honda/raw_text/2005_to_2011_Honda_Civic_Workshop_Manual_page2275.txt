8. If the plastigage measures too wide or too narrow, remove the upper half of the
bearing, install a new, complete bearing with the same color code(s), and
recheck the clearance. Do not file, shim, or scrape the bearings or the caps to
adjust clearance.
9. If the plastigage shows the clearance is still incorrect, try the next larger or
smaller bearing (the color listed above or below the current one), and check
clearance again. If the proper clearance cannot be obtained by using the
appropriate larger or smaller bearing, replace the crankshaft, and start over.

stamped with a number or bar (1, 2, 3 or 4/I, II, III, or MM) indicating the
range. You may find any combination of numbers and bars in any engine. (Half
