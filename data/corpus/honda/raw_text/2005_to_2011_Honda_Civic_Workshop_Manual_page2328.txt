6. If the plastigage measures too wide or too narrow, remove the crankshaft, and
remove the upper half of the bearing. Install a new, complete bearing with the
same color code(s), and recheck the clearance. Do not file, shim, or scrape the

larger or smaller bearings, replace the crankshaft and start over.
