2. Turn the ignition switch to ON (II). Make sure the HDS communicates with
the PCM. If it does not, go to the DLC circuit troubleshooting (see DLC
CIRCUIT TROUBLESHOOTING ).
3. Select Shift Lock Solenoid Test in the Miscellaneous Test Menu, and check
that the shift lock solenoid operates with the HDS.
4. Make sure that the shift lever can be moved out of P when Shift Lock Solenoid
is ON. Move the shift lever back in P, and make sure it locks when Shift Lock
Solenoid is OFF.
5. Make sure that the shift lock releases when the shift lock release is pushed, and
check that it locks when the shift lock release is released.
6. If the shift lock solenoid does not work properly, go to the shift lock system
troubleshooting (see SHIFT LOCK SYSTEM CIRCUIT
TROUBLESHOOTING ).
