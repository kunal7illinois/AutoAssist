8. Move the seat back in small increments (about 0.2 in., 5 mm) until the driver's
seat position sensor reads "NOT NEAR." The seat should be about 25 mm (1
in.) from the front.
NOTE:
It takes a few seconds for the HDS to display
(cid:1)
changes, so wait about 5 seconds between each
move.
If the driver's seat position sensor does not work as
(cid:1)
described above, check the driver's seat position
sensor or the cover plate for damage, and replace
parts as needed.
9. Turn the ignition switch OFF, and disconnect the HDS from the DLC.
