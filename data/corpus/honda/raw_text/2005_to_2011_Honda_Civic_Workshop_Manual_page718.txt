The PCM turns shift solenoid valve B ON, and shift solenoid valve A and B remain
ON. Shift solenoid valve B pressure (SB) is applied to the right side of shift valve B
and the left side of the servo control valve. Shift valve B then moves to the left side
releasing the 3rd clutch pressure. The 4th clutch is engaged by the A/T clutch
pressure control solenoid valve B pressure mode.
