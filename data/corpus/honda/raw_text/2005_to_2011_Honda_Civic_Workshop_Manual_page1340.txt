vacuum is available, the check valve is not working properly. Replace the
brake booster vacuum hose and check valve, and retest. If vacuum is found, go
to step 5.
5. With the engine off, reconnect the vacuum hose to the brake booster.
6. Start the engine, and then pinch the brake booster vacuum hose between the
check valve and the booster.
7. Turn the ignition switch off, and wait 30 seconds. Press the brake pedal several
times using normal pressure. When the pedal is first pressed, it should be low.
On consecutive applications, the pedal height should gradually rise.
If the pedal position does not vary inspect the seal between the master

cylinder and booster. If the seal is OK, replace the brake booster.
If the pedal position varies, replace the brake booster vacuum hose/check
(cid:1)
valve assembly.
