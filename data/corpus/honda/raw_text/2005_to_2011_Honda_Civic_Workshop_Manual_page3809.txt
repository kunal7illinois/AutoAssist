Fig. 5: Identifying Pressure Control Valve
9. Fully open the pressure control valve (B).
10. Start the engine, and let it idle.
11. Turn the steering wheel from lock-to-lock several times to warm the fluid to
operating temperature at 158°F (70°C).
12. Measure steady-state fluid pressure while the engine is idling. If the pump is in
2
good condition, the gauge should be no more than 1,470 kPa (15 kgf/cm , 213
psi). If it reads higher, check for:
Clogged or deformed pump outlet or return line between the pump and the
(cid:1)
steering gearbox.
Clogged valve body unit.
(cid:1)
13. Raise the engine speed to 3,000 rpm, and measure the fluid pressure. If the
pump is in good condition, the gauge should read at least 1,470 kPa (15
2
kgf/cm , 213 psi). If it reads higher, repair or replace the pump.
14. Lower the engine speed, and let it idle. Close the shut-off valve, then close the
pressure control valve gradually until the pressure gauge needle is stable. Read
the pressure.
NOTE: Do not keep the shut-off valve closed more than 5
seconds or the pump could be damaged by
overheating.
15. Immediately open the shut-off valve fully.
