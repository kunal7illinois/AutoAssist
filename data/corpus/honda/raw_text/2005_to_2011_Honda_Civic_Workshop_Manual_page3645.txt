(cid:1)
service information about the navigation system.
Check the Navigation System Manual for a list of
(cid:1)
common DVD screen error messages and the probable
cause.
Go into the Diagnostic Menu and use the Car Status
(cid:1)
test (see CAR STATUS) to check the status of the
display.
1. Check the DVD-ROM reading surface for scratches.
Are there scratches?
YES -Replace the DVD-ROM.
NO -If the problem occurs occasionally when the system is cold, this is
normal. If the problem occurs frequently when driving, replace the navigation
unit (see NAVIGATION UNIT REMOVAL/INSTALLATION).
SYSTEM ALWAYS COMES UP IN IN-LINE DIAGNOSTIC MODE
1. When a navigation unit is powered up for the first time at the factory, the
factory diagnosis screen (In Line Diag) appears. Normally the factory performs
the steps necessary to verify proper operation and terminate the factory
diagnostic. Until the proper confirmation sequence is performed, the screen
will appear every time the vehicle is started.
