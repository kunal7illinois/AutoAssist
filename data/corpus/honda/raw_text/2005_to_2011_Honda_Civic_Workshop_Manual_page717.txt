As the speed of the vehicle reaches the programmed value, the PCM turns shift
solenoid valve A ON. Shift solenoid valve B remains OFF, and C remains ON.
Shift solenoid valve A pressure (SA) is applied to the right end of shift valve A and
the left end of cut valve A. Shift valve A is moved to the left side, switching the line
pressure (5L) port to the A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve C pressure (5K)
port leading to the 3rd clutch. Also shift valve A uncovers the 4th clutch pressure
(40) port leading A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve B pressure (5H) to the
4th clutch. The 3rd and 4th clutches are engaged by the A/T clutch pressure control
solenoid valve pressure mode.
