Main Valve Body
The main valve body contains the manual valve, cut valve B, shift valves A, C, and
D, the relief valve, the lock-up control valve, the cooler check valve, the servo
control valve, and the ATF pump gears. The primary function of the main valve
body is to switch fluid pressure on and off to control hydraulic pressure going to the
hydraulic control system.
