ABS Features
Anti-lock control
Without ABS, when the brake pedal is pressed while driving, the wheels sometimes
lock before the vehicle comes to a stop. In such an event, the maneuverability of the
vehicle is reduced if the front wheels are locked, and the stability of the vehicle is
reduced if the rear wheels are locked, creating an extremely unstable condition.
With ABS, the system precisely controls the slip rate of the wheels to ensure
maximum grip force from the tires, and it thereby ensures maneuverability and
stability of the vehicle. The ABS calculates the slip rate of the wheels based on the
four wheel speeds, then it controls the brake fluid pressure to reach the target slip
