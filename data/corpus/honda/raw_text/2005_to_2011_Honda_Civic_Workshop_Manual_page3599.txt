PRECAUTION ON CUSTOMER SNEAK PREVIEWS
Your customer might request a look (or sneak preview) at features in the latest
navigation software. You should never preview a navigation DVD in a customer's
vehicle. Inserting a new DVD installs the latest software from the DVD into the
memory of the customer's navigation system. When the original DVD is reinstalled,
the newer software remains in memory and is often incompatible with the
customer's original DVD Map and POI database.
If your customer wishes to see the latest navigation coverage or software features,
demonstrate it on an in-stock vehicle that already has the latest DVD version.
If, by chance, a newer version is located accidentally, either by the dealer or the
customer, the only remedy is to enter the navigation diagnostic mode's Version
screen and do a forced download. Refer to the i N for applicable patches that may
need reinstalling.
