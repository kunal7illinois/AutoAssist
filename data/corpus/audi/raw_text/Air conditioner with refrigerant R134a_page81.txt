Note
♦ The design of the receiver on the Audi A4 (8K_) 2008 > differs
depending on the condenser manufacturer ⇒ Air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 . The receiver may be attached or integrated de‐
pending on the version of the condenser. The integrated re‐
ceiver contains a dryer cartridge which is currently not always
available as a replacement part. On vehicles fitted with this
condenser, it may therefore be necessary to replace the entire
condenser after rectifying any problems ⇒ Electronic parts

♦ In the case of condensers with an integrated receiver / dryer
cartridge which cannot be renewed separately or which are
not available separately, the condenser is to be replaced after
flushing (together with the built-in dryer cartridge) ⇒ Heating,
