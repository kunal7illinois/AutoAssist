8.4 Electrogalvinization
With electrogalvinization, the sheet steel band functions as a
cathode to zinc anode plates (positive electrodes).
The gap to the sheet steel is filled with electrolyte, an acidic, elec‐
troconductive liquid that contains zinc ions.
It is an electrochemical process by which zinc is dissolved with
the help of electric current and transferred to the sheet steel.
An even, fine, unstructured layer of zinc forms which can easily
be manipulated further, such as with cutting, pressing, welding,
priming and painting.
8.5 Hot Galvanized Coating
With hot-dip galvanized coating, the sheet steel panel runs
through an approx 842º F ( 450 ºC) liquid zinc bath. An extremely
thin layer of zinc-iron alloy forms directly on the panel surface as
an “adhesive material” for a layer of pure zinc which eventually
reaches a thickness of about 10 mm per side.
The galvanized blooms characteristic of hot-dip galvanized coat‐
ing are undesirable for body pieces and are therefore largely
prevented with various techniques, such as rerolling.
The body pieces of the floor assemblies, door pillars and wheel
housings that are not visible are hot-dip galvanized on both sides.
