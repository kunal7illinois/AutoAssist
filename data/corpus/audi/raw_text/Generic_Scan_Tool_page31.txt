Generic Scan Tool - Edition 07.2011
at least one PASS diagnostic result was detected - and the Min‐
imum Trip Conditions for a General Denominator (without con‐
sidering high/ambient temperature) were met in this phase in any
DCY after erasing the DTC memory. - The engine control module
relays the message “Minimum Trip conditions met” to all other
OBD control modules via CAN: CAN message OBD_01, Byte 8,
Bit 4: OBD_Minimum_Trip - Permanent Fault Codes may NOT be
erased if the diagnostic result is FAIL after clearing the DTC
memory. A Pending Fault Code should be stored and the DTC
memory line should be overwritten with new Freeze Frame data.
(Exception: If the Pending Fault Code is corrected without a Con‐
firmed Fault Code being detected, the Permanent Fault Code may
also be erased under the conditions described below.) - Perma‐
nent Fault Codes should be erased in engine control modules
after Update Programming. At this time, all readiness bits (Mode
01 PID $01) must be reset to “not complete” [ (g)(4.4.6)(D) ]. Per‐
manent Fault Codes should not be erased in OBD control mod‐
ules with Comprehensive Components (CCM) as a single
readiness bit if the identical program/data status is being pro‐
grammed. If a different program/data status is being program‐
med, Permanent Fault Codes should be erased after Update
Programming. - The procedure in Mode 01 through Mode 09 and
in the service tester is NOT affected by implementation of the
Permanent Fault Codes.
