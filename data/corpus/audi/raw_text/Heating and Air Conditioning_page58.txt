4.4 Replacing pulley (“Denso” air condition‐
er compressor, version “2”)
Note
♦ If the pulley overload safeguard has been tripped, check the
freedom of movement of the air conditioner compressor before
replacing the pulley. Replace the entire air conditioner com‐
pressor if it is stiff.
♦ Depending on the engine version, detachment of the pulley
may involve separating the air conditioner compressor from
the engine ⇒ page 40 .
♦ Various pulley designs may be fitted depending on the type of
air conditioner compressor and the engine version ⇒ Elec‐
tronic parts catalogue .
♦ The pulley is supplied as a replacement part together with the
drive plate and cap under one part number. The pulley and
drive plate are held together by a screw, which is not required
and can therefore be disposed of. This screw is used at the
factory to apply a pre-determined quantity of a specific grease
to the thread of the drive plate. This quantity of grease is suf‐
ficient for once-only screwing of the drive plate onto the com‐
pressor shaft (following unscrewing, drive plates are therefore
not to be re-used) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
