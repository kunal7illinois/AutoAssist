Contact corrosion
Aluminium has a passivating oxide surface layer The greater the difference in potential, the greater
which protects the material underneath from corro- the contact corrosion. As aluminium is normally the
sion. This is why an unpainted aluminium part nor- lesser noble metal, it degrades.
mally does not corrode.
However, if there is contact between aluminium and
a metal higher up in the electrochemical series than
aluminium and if an electrolyte, such as salt water,
is present in this region, contact corrosion will
occur.

Schematic of contact corrosion with example
Contact corrosion can only be prevented by taking In the case of the Audi TT, the following anti-corro-
measures to stop the flow of electrical current sion measures have been taken:
induced by the potential difference between
the two metals. This is best achieved by painting the – coating of all steel screws and fasteners such as
surfaces. However, the risk of corrosion is high even self-piercing rivets
if a tiny amount of paint damage occurs. – Galvanising of all sheet-metal parts (zinc and alu-
minium have a smaller potential difference than
steel and aluminium)
– Insulation by means of adhesive
– Sealing of aluminium-steel joints
