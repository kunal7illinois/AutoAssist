Low tyre pressure indicator
In all markets except North America, the
AudiTTCoupé ‘07 comes with an upgraded version
of the low tyre pressure indicator previously
featured in the Audi A3. Being an indirect measuring
system, no tyre pressure sensors are installed in
the wheels.
Using a new evaluation method, it is now possible
to detect simultaneous pressure loss to at multiple
wheels. Tyre pressures are monitored
simultaneously using two different concepts.
