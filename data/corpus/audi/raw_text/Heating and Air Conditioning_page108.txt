7.11.1 Removing and installing air flow flap
control motor -V71-
Note
♦ After installing a new control motor, check actuation by the air
conditioner (heater) operating unit, Climatronic control unit -
J255- and operation of the control motor (correct position of
recirculated-air flap and air flow/fresh-air flap) ⇒ "Guided fault-
finding" function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and information
system VAS 5051 .
♦ Air flow flap control motor -V71- can only be readily removed
in “fresh air mode stop” position and can only be installed in
this position. If the control motor comes to a halt in a different
position and it can no longer be moved electrically into the
“fresh air mode stop” position, it is difficult to detach and thus
remove.
