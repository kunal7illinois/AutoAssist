13.1 Design of an SST tyre
Removing and fitting run-flat tyres ⇒ page 10
If run-flat tyres are used, a tyre pressure monitor display must be
fitted.
Tyre damage and the resulting loss of pressure are not readily
visible.
SST tyres are labelled on the sidewall with a special RSC symbol
(= Runflat System Component).
The markings on the sidewall of a run-flat tyre may differ accord‐
ing to ma n ufacturer.
A self supporting tyre has run-flat properties in the event of a
pressure loss. In the event of a puncture, the vehicle can be driven
to the nearest workshop subject to certain restrictions (see ⇒
Owner's Manual .
Benefits
SST tyres can be driven for 50 km at up to 80 km/h even after a
complete loss of pressure.
Driving style, vehicle speed, road surface, weather conditions,
tyre condition and tyre load all affect the distance that can be
driven with a puncture.
With an SST tyre, it is not necessary to change the wheel imme‐
diately even with the tyre completely deflated (i.e. you don't need
to stop the vehicle in a dangerous place or in conditions of poor
visibility).
The braking, steering and driving response are virtually unim‐
paired even with the tyre completely deflated.
You no longer need a spare wheel if SST tyres are fitted. From
the customer's point of view, the benefits are savings in space
and a lighter vehicle.
Technology in detail
Standard tyres without run-flat properties
– -I- Normal tyre with air
– -II- Normal tyre without air
– If the normal tyre loses air, the rim presses heavily against the
sidewall. The rubber becomes very hot and deteriorates quick‐
ly when rolling flat.
SST tyre with reinforced sidewall
SST technology is based on self-supporting reinforced sidewalls.
