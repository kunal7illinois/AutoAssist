2.5.2 Battery without Visual Indicator
♦ On batteries with visible min and max markings, electrolyte
level only needs to be checked visually.
♦ The electrolyte level must be above the MIN marking.
♦ Use a flashlight to improve visibility when performing an exte‐
rior visual inspection of the min and max markings.
Caution
Replace the battery if the electrolyte level is below the mini‐
mum marking! Refer to ⇒ Electrical Equipment; Rep. Gr. 27 ;
Removal and Installation .
2.5.3 Battery with Visual Indicator
♦ As the “visual indicator“ is only located in a battery cell, only
the battery electrolyte level for this battery cell can be checked.
♦ The “visual indicator“ -arrow- provides information about the
fluid levels and the state of charge for the battery being
checked.
♦ Bubbles can build up under the “visual indicator“ when the
battery is charging and also while driving, causing the color
displayed to be incorrect.
