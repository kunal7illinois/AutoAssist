Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
Note
♦ If the specified value for radial and lateral run-out is not ex‐
ceeded, the wheel can be balanced to 0 grams. For specified
values, refer to page ⇒ page 50 .
♦ If the radial and lateral run-out are not within the specified val‐
ues, the tyre must be rotated again.
– Deflate the tyre and press off the tyre beads from the rim
flanges.
– Rotate the tyre 90° with respect to the wheel (1/4 of a turn).
– Inflate the tyre to 4 bar again and check true running.
Note
♦ If the specified value for radial and lateral run-out is not ex‐
ceeded, the wheel can be balanced to 0 grams.
♦ If the radial and lateral run-out are not within the specified val‐
ues, the tyre must be rotated again.
– Press the tyre off the rim flanges again as described above.
– Rotate the tyre 180° with respect to the wheel (1/2 a turn).
If the radial and/or lateral run-out are still not within the specified
values, check the wheel for radial and/or lateral run-out:
⇒ page 49 .
If the measured values for radial and lateral run-out of the wheel
are within the specified values, the tyre has an impermissibly high
radial or lateral run-out. In this case, the tyre must be renewed.
Note
♦ After fitting the tyres there will be fitting lubricant between the
tyres and the rim flanges.
♦ For this reason, severe braking and ac c eleration manoeuvres
must be avoided for the first 100 or 20 0 km driven. The tyres
may otherwise rotate on the rims and your work will have been
in vain.
