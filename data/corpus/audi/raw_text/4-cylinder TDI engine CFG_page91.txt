Separating parts of new conrod
It is possible that the two parts of a new conrod are not completely
separated as intended. If it is not possible to take off the conrod
bearing cap by hand, proceed as follows:
– To avoid any risk of damage, the conrod should only be clam‐
ped lightly in a vice using jaw covers as shown in illustration.
• The conrod is clamped in position below the dotted line.
– Unscrew bolts -arrows- approx. 5 turns.
– Using a plastic hammer, carefully knock conrod bearing cap
loose -arrow-.
