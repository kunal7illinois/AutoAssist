♦ If the clutch pedal does not return to its initial position after
releasing it (clutch pedal in rest position), you must bleed the
clutch system (further measures ⇒ page 12 ) .
♦ Ensure that the pressure plate is kept straight: loosen and
tighten bolts consecutively in steps of 90°.
♦ If the clutch has burnt out, thoroughly clean the gearbox hous‐
ing in area of clutch and parts of the engine facing the gearbox
in order to prevent odours.
♦ Only blow out dual-mass flywheel with compressed air.
♦ Clutch pressure plates have an anti-corrosion coating and are
greased. With the exception of the friction surface for the
clutch plate, the pressure plate must not be cleaned. Other‐
wise the service life of the clutch will be considerably reduced.
♦ The friction surface of the pressure plate and the dual-mass
flywheel must be cleaned (degreased) thoroughly.
