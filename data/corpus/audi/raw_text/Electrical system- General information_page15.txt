Electrical system; General information - Edition 10.2010
– Dip hydrometer into battery cell and draw in electrolyte until
the float is floating freely in the electrolyte.
♦ The greater the relative density of the electrolyte drawn in, the
higher the float will ride.
♦ The relative density in kg/dm3 (specific density of electrolyte)
can be read off the hydrometer scale.
– Take reading on hydrometer and compare it to values given
in table:
Charge state Relative density of electrolyte in kg/dm3
In normal climatic In tropical countries
zones
discharged 1.12 1.08
half charged 1.20 1.16
well charged 1.28 1.23
The relative density in normal climatic zones must be at least 1.24
kg/dm3. If relative density is too low in all battery cells:
– Charge battery and then repeat electrolyte relative density
test.
Example 1
Battery cell 1 2 3 4 5 6
Relative density per battery cell in 1.24 1.25 1.25 1.10 1) 1.24 1.25
kg/dm3
• 1) Relative density in battery cell 4 is too low (difference greater than 0.03 kg/dm3).
Example 2
Battery cell 1 2 3 4 5 6
Relative density per battery cell in 1.26 1.26 1.25 1.14 1) 1.18 1) 1.24
kg/dm3
• 1) Relative density in battery cells 4 and 5 is too low (difference greater than 0.03 kg/dm3).
– Renew the battery if the specified values are not attained.
Note
The battery must be renewed if the relative density of the elec‐
trolyte measured in the individual battery cells varies by more than
0.03 kg/dm3 .
