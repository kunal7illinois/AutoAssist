7 Fuel filter - all vehicles
In the fuel system of the Audi TT, which has no direct fuel return
line, the fuel pressure regulator is located in the fuel filter. In this
system, only the supply pipe is routed to the front, to the engine
compartment. The fuel pressure regulator opens when the pres‐
sure in the fuel supply pipe rises above a specified value. Excess
fuel flows from the filter directly back to the tank via a return line.
