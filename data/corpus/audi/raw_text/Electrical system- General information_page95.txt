housing is fitted with a secondary locking device, this must
always be opened or removed using the specified tool before
releasing and extracting individual crimp connectors.
♦ The secondary locking device is of a different colour to the rest
of the connector housing to aid identification and show how it
works.
♦ The types of connector housing shown here are only a selec‐
tion designed to illustrate examples of the various operating
principles of the secondary locking devices.
