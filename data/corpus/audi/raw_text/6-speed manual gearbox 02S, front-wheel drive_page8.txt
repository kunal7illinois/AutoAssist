3 Calculating ratio “i”
Example:
6th gear Final drive
Drive gear ZG1 = 38 ZA1 = 17
Driven gear ZG2 = 31 ZA2 = 62
i = Z2 : Z1 1)
iG = gear ratio = ZG2 : ZG1 = 31 : 38 = 0.816
iA = axle ratio = ZA2 : ZA1 = 62 : 17 = 3.647
iov = overall ratio
iov = iG x iA = 0.816 x 3.647 = 2.975
1) Z1 = No. of teeth on drive gear, Z2 = No. of teeth on driven gear
