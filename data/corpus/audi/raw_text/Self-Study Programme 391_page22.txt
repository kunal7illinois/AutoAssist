Electrical convertible top control system
Convertible top front switch F202 Metal arm
Convertible top front switch F202
Like the convertible top stowed switch F171, the
convertible top front switch F202 is a Hall sensor.
This switch is also located on the left main bearing
of the convertible top.
The convertible top operation control unit J256
monitors the power supply of the Hall sensor. If the
control unit measures a voltage of approx. 9 volts,
the convertible top is closed.
If the voltage drops to approx. 3.5 volts, the
convertible top operation control unit J256
concludes that the convertible top is no longer
closed.

The convertible top lock closed switch F295 is
located on the left and right lock top parts installed
in the forward roof section (tip of the roof).
The signals the convertible top operation control
unit J256 receives from the switches inform the
former whether the locks are closed or not.
This information is used, among other things, for
opening and closing the locks parallel to the
convertible top operating cycle.
The two convertible top lock closed switches F295
are connected in series.
