Rep. gr. 94 .
On the rear axle these signals are supplied by the rear left vehicle
level sender -G76- and rear right vehicle level sender -G77- to the
electronically controlled damping control unit -J250- and/or the
gas discharge light control units (left/right) -J343/344- .
These signals are required for calculating the current attitude of
the vehicle.
The automatic headlight range control reacts to changes in the
suspension height (attitude of the vehicle).
The following situations may produce a change in the suspension
height:
♦ Towing a trailer/caravan
♦ Different loads (vehicle unladen, partly laden or fully laden)
The vehicle level sender is only available as a replacement part
complete with coupling rod and upper and lower retaining plates.
Note
The basic headlight setting must always be checked and, on ve‐
hicles with electronic damping control (Audi magnetic ride), the
reference position of the suspension must always be re-adapted
in the following cases:
♦ Following assembly work on vehicle level sender
♦ If wishbone has been removed and installed
♦ If the bolted connections -2- or -5- have been unfastened
Removing
– Unplug connector.
– Remove nut -5-.
– Remove bolt -2-.
– Take out vehicle level sender -3-.
Installing
Installation is carried out in the reverse sequence. Note the fol‐
lowing points:
Locating hook on coupling rod must engage on wishbone.
Lever of sender must face outwards.
