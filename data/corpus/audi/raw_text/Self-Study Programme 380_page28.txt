Soundpipe
A soundpipe is used on the 3.2l V6 engine to give the engine a sportier sound. The intake noise is transmitted
to the vehicle body via a connecting line from the intake manifold to the plenum chamber and via a resonator.
The soundpipe has been developed to accentuate the dynamism and sportiness of the 3.2l engine
The soundpipe produces a sporty sound in the vehicle interior without impairing comfort. The pressure
pulsations are amplified by the gas exchange cycle via the soundpipe without exceeding the exterior noise
limits. Unwanted noise emission from ancillary units and tire noise are to a large extent avoided by the fact
that the occupant cell is well-insulated. As a result, comfortable travelling is still possible.
