Body Repairs - Edition 09.2009
3 Expanded foam inserts
Various body cavities of the Audi TT 2007 are fitted with expanded
foam inserts.
The foam inserts reduce the noise transmitted to the interior when
driving.
These pre-moulded parts are fitted during body manufacture and
subsequently increase their volume in the paint shop drying oven
at approx. 180 °C after priming.
Caution
The replacement foam inserts expand only after reaching
about 180°C. For this reason, an additional filler foam is used
when performing repairs.
Filler foam required for repairs: D 506 KG1 A3.
As the required temperatures cannot be achieved under normal
workshop conditions, proceed as follows:
Remove residue of foam material on vehicle.
Restore paint coating; apply two coats (wet on wet) of glass/paint
primer D 009 200 02 if necessary, flash-off time approx.10 mi‐
nutes.
Requirement
Before continuing with this procedure, ensure that the replace‐
ment panel is ready for installation, i.e. cut to shape, matched up
to the vehicle, corrosion protection applied.
Ren e wing expanded foam insert
Fix expanded foam insert to vehicle.
Apply filler foam D 506 KG1 A3 to replacement panel.
Secure new part in position. Gently press in new part in vicinity of
expanded foam insert until it makes contact, and then weld into
place.
The foam hardens within 25 minutes.
Do not weld (SG) within 15 mm of the foam insert (on either side).
After painting the vehicle the repaired area must be cavity-sealed.
