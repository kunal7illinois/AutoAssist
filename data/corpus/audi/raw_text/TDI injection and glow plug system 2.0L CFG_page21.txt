To ensure that the air mass meter functions properly, it is impor‐
tant to observe the following notes and instructions.
Note
♦ If the air filter element is very dirty or wet, dirt or water could
reach the air mass meter and affect the air mass value. This
would lead to loss of power, since a smaller injection quantity
is calculated.
♦ Always use genuine part for air filter element.
♦ The air cleaner housing MUST be clean.
♦ To prevent malfunctions, cover critical parts of the engine air
intake (air mass meter, air pipes, etc.) with a clean cloth when
blowing out the air cleaner housing with compressed air.
♦ Observe environmental requirements for disposal.
– Remove snow screen -1- and clean it.

The snow screen is not fitted on all vehicles.
