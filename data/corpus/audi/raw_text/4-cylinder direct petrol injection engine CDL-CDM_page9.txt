3 Safety precautions
When working on the fuel system note the following warnings:
WARNING
The fuel system operates at extremely high pressure. This can
cause injury.
♦ The fuel pressure in the high-pressure section of the in‐
jection system must be reduced to a residual pressure
prior to opening the system.
♦ Wrap a clean cloth around the connection and carefully
loosen the connection to allow the residual pressure to
dissipate.

system ⇒ page 5 .
WARNING
Escaping fuel can cause a fire risk.
♦ The power supply for the fuel pump control unit -J538-
must be disconnected before opening the fuel system, as
the fuel system pressurisation pump -G6- will be activated
briefly when the driver's door is opened with the battery
still connected.
