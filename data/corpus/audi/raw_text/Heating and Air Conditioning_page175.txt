Audi TT 2007 ➤
Heating and Air Conditioning - Edition 04.2009
Note
Also heed the notes on start-up of the air conditioner after charg‐
ing ⇒ Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a .
12.9 Removing and installing expansion
valve
Note
♦ After switching off the air conditioner compressor, a relatively
long period may elapse with this vehicle before the pressure
on the high-pressure end decreases (the expansion valve is
cold and the pressure on the low-pressure end increases rap‐
idly after switch-off, the expansion valve closes and the refrig‐
erant can only flow slowly to the low-pressure end).
♦ The section of tubing in the refrigerant pipe on the high-pres‐
sure end (thin pipe) -C- is being gradually discontinued in
Model Year 2007. If there is no such tubing, bend the refrig‐
erant pipe -C- carefully and only to the extent which is abso‐
lutely necessary to remove the expansion valve. If necessary,
unfasten a refrigerant pipe with no tubing section from the
holder so as not to damage the refrigerant pipe.
Removing
– Switch off ignition.
– Drain the refrigerant circuit ⇒ Air conditioner with refrigerant
R134a .
– Detach refrigerant pipes from expansion valve ⇒ page 166 .
– Screw out the bolts -A-.
– Pull the expansion valve -B- out of the heat insulation -C-.
Note
Seal open pipes and co n nections at evaporator with suitable caps
(to prevent ingress of dirt and moisture).
Installing
• Tightening torque: Bolts -A- (expansion valve to holder at
evaporator) 10 Nm.
Install in reverse order, paying attention to the following:
– Replace the O-rings -D- and -E-. For version, refer to ⇒ Elec‐
tronic parts catalogue .
– Pay attention to correct positioning of the O-rings -D- and -E-
on the connecting pipes to the evaporator -F- and -G-.
