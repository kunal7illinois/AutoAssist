Oil seals, seals, O-rings and gaskets
♦ Renew O-rings, seals and gaskets.
♦ After removing gaskets and seals, always inspect the contact
surface on the housing or shaft for burrs resulting from removal
or for other signs of damage.
♦ Before installing oil seals, lightly oil the outer circumference of
the seal and fill the space between the sealing lips -arrow-
about half full with grease -G 052 128 A1- .
♦ The open side of the oil seal should face the side containing
the fluid.
♦ When installing a new oil seal, position the seal such that the
sealing lip does not contact the shaft in the same place as the
old seal (make use of installation depth tolerances).
♦ Lightly lubricate O-rings with oil before installation to prevent
them being trapped during assembly.
♦ Check oil level after installing new gaskets, O-rings and oil
seals
