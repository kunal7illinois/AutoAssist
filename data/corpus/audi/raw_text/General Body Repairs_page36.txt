9.4 Repairing cracks and tears (up to a length of 100 mm)
– First clean and dry the damaged panel.
– By drilling into the crack (5 mm) and grinding out to a V-shaped
groove, you can remove irregularities caused by stretching of
the plastic.
– Then clean the repaired area with cleaning fluid D 195 850 A1.
Allow to dry for 5 minutes.
– Spray on a thin coat of primer D 195 150 A1 and allow to dry
for 10 minutes.
– As the next step, bond in a reinforcing mat D 002 KD A1 onto
the reverse side of the panel using adhesive D 180 KU A1 so
that it overlaps the damaged section by at least 20 mm.
– The hardening process can be speeded up with the aid of an
infra-red lamp. Set to 15 minutes at 60°-70°C.
– Now you can fill in the hollowed-out area on the front of the
panel using adhesive D 180 KU1 A1 and smooth down with a
spatula.
– Again, the hardening process can be speeded up on the front
of the panel with the aid of an infra-red lamp.
