Caution
Increased corrosion due to exposed copper layer.
♦ Do not sand away the tin plating to such an extent that the
copper layer underneath becomes visible. Galvanic ef‐
fects can cause increased corrosion.
Note
As the thickness of the tin coating varies, it is necessary to clean
the screw connection in several stages and check it in between.
