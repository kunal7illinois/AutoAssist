Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
However, in some cases it may not be possible to eliminate tyre
noise completely.
2.2 Requirements to be met by tyres
A - Wet braking properties
B - Driving comfort
C - Steering accuracy
D - Driving stability
E - Tyre weight
F - Life expectancy
G - Rolling resistance
H - Aquaplaning
The pie chart illustrates to what extent the tyre meets the various
requirements. The tyre in this example (with its specific structure
and rubber composition) would meet the requirements listed
above (A to H) to the extent indicated by the size of the segments
of the pie.
Improving performance in one segment would result in poorer
performance in the other segments.
Example:
An improvement in wet braking properties -A- leads to a reduction
in driving comfort -B-, rolling resistance -G- and life expectancy
-F-.
The life expectancy of a car tyre depends not only on the rubber
composition and design of the tyre. The conditions of operation,
the type of vehicle and the style of driving also have a significant
influence on its mileage performance.
Modern vehicles enable comfortable and economic driving, but
also a more "sporty" driving style. Mileage performance of the
tyres can vary from approx. 5,000 to 40,000 kilometres or more.
Note
The driving style is the most important influencing factor as re‐
gards the service life of a tyre.
2.3 Factors influencing the service life of a

degrees.
♦ Speed
♦ Braking
