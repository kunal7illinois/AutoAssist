Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ Exclusive use was made at the start of production of „Sanden“
air conditioner compressors. With effect from Model Year
1999, use has also been made of „Zexel / Valeo“ air condi‐
tioner compressors ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87
and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The air conditioner compressor designation „Zexel / Valeo“
was changed as of 2006 to „Valeo“.
♦ With effect from 10.03 (as of vehicle identification number
8N41015239), production of the Audi TT was switched from
the condenser with part no. „1J0 820 411 J“ (with a flat tube
width of 20 mm) to the condenser with part no. „ 8N0 820 411
A“ (with a flat tube width of 16 mm) ⇒ page 148 . In the period
between 06.04 and 08.04, a certain number of vehicles was
again fitted with condensers with a flat tube width of 20 mm.
♦ Condensers with a flat tube width = 16 mm must be filled with
approx. 120 g less refrigerant than condensers with a flat tube
width = 20 mm ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ In the period between 10.03 (vehicles as of vehicle identifica‐
tion number 8N41015239) and 06.04, the Audi TT was fitted
at the factory with a condenser with a flat tube width of 16 mm
(with part no. „ 8N0 820 411 A“) and the refrigerant circuit was
filled with 750 + 50 g of refrigerant. These vehicles were also
provided with a label indicating the wrong capacity, namely
750 g (or 700 g in 06.04) instead of 650 g ⇒ page 148 . Under
certain ambient conditions (e.g. high ambient temperatures),
over-filling of the systems may result in the air conditioner
compressor being shut off on account of excess pressure in
the refrigerant circuit. Complaints may also be received about
engine performance (e.g. humming and drumming; the engine
is subjected to greater load as the air conditioner compressor
constantly has to cope with excessively high pressure). Rem‐
edy: Discharge the refrigerant circuit, then re-charge with the
correct capacity and replace the label with a label indicating
the correct capacity or delete the old capacity indicated on the
label and enter the new capacity in waterproof ink for example.
♦ Pay attention to flat tube dimensions if condenser is renewed.
If a condenser with different flat tube dimensions is to be fitted,
also replace the label indicating the refrigerant R134a capacity
or delete the old capacity and enter the new capacity in wa‐
terproof ink for example ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
