Audi TT 2007 ➤
Running gear, front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive - Edition 08.2010
Note
♦ If this is not the case, the shock absorber does not necessarily
need to be renewed. Provided there has been no major loss
of fluid, it will still be as effective as a conventional shock ab‐
sorber.
♦ Even without gas pressure, the shock absorber will provide full
damping effect as long as there has been no major loss of fluid.
However, it may produce more noise.
3.3 Checking shock absorbers on shock
tester
The shock tester allows shock absorbers to be tested without re‐
moving them from the vehicle. The damping effect can be as‐
sessed on the basis of the pointer deflection or the print-out.
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Boge shock tester or
♦ Sachs shock tester -V.A.G 1975- or
♦ Maha shock absorber tester -VAS 1990-
Note
♦ Temperature +10 ... +40 °C.
♦ Driver in vehicle.
♦ Vehicle stationary.
♦ Correct tyre inflation pressure.
♦ Wheels of vehicle in a central and straight position on the tyre
contact plates.
♦ Front wheels in straight-ahead position.
♦ Handbrake not applied, brake pedal not depressed.
♦ Ignition on.
♦ Test mode active on vehicles with Audi magnetic ride (AMR)
- electronic damping control.
Activating test mode for Audi magnetic ride (AMR) - electronic
damping control
– Press shock absorber damping adjustment button -E387-
⇒ page 45 in centre console and hold for over 5 seconds.
Diode in shock absorber damping adjustment button -E387-
flashes during test mode.
– The test mode is deactivated when shock absorber damping
adjustment button -E387- ⇒ page 45 is pressed again, when
the ignition is switched off, or when the vehicle is driven at a
speed of at least 10 km/h.
Test results
The condition of the shock absorbers can only be evaluated as
follows:
♦ Satisfactory damping effect
or
♦ Unsatisfactory damping effect
