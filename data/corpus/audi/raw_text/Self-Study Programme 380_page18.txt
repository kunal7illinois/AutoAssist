protection system for the North American market
The additional functions and components of the occupant protection system for the North American market
are described on the following pages.
The occupant protection system is equipped with additional functions and components,
e.g. second crash sensor for front airbag, so that the Audi TT Coupé ‘07 meets the statutory and market-
specific requirements for the US market.
Seat occupied detection, front passenger side
The front passenger side seat occupied recognition system was largely adopted from the Audi Q7.
The system basically comprises the following components:
– Seat squab
– Sensor mat for seat occupied recognition These components form a single
– Pressure sensor for seat occupied recognition G452 unit and must not be separated
– Seat occupied recognition control unit J706 from each other.
– Front passenger side belt switch E25
– Seat belt force sensor for seat occupied recognition G453

Driver side belt switch E24
Front passenger side belt switch E25
The Audi TT Coupé ‘07 for the North American
market is equipped with seat belt switches for belt-
fastened recognition on the driver and front
passenger sides.
Seat belt switches E24 and E25 are integrated in the
belt buckles on the front seats So-called "reed
switches" are used. The reed switch remains open
until the occupants have fastened their seat belts.
The airbag control unit J234 performs a resistance
measurement from which it can determine whether
the occupants have fastened their seat belts or not.
Depending on the position of the reed switch, the 361_029
measurement is made using one or both resistors.
