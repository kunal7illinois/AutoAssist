Persons sitting in the front passenger's seat could be injured if
the airbag is triggered in an accident.
• The use of test equipment while driving causes distraction.
• There is an increased risk of injury if test equipment is not
secured.

♦ Use only vehicle diagnosis and service information sys‐
tem -VAS 5052 A- or diagnosis system -VAS 5053- .
♦ The test equipment -1- must rest flat on the passenger's
thighs (as shown in illustration) and must be operated by
the passenger.
When working on the fuel system note the following warnings:

♦ The fuel system is pressurised. The fuel pressure in the
high-pressure section of the injection system must be re‐
duced to a residual pressure prior to opening; for proce‐

♦ The connection must be opened immediately after reduc‐
ing the pressure; wrap a cloth around the connection and
allow the residual pressure (approx. 7 bar) to dissipate.
