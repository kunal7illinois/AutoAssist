Bonded joints
The following procedure is used for repairs on bonded joints:
Cutting:
– Roughly cut out roof to gain access to bonded joint.
– Use oscillating cutter blade to cut through bonded joint.
Types of bonded joints
Bonded joints and spot-welded bonded joints are being used in‐
creasingly at the factory, as they help to improve body rigidity and
strength. The following distinction is made:
Adhesive-bonded joints
In the case of adhesive-bonded joints, the joint between the sheet
metal parts is formed only by the adhesive.
The distance between the bonding surfaces should not be less
than 2 mm or more than 4 mm. The bonding surfaces may have
to be aligned.
Repair measures
– The bonded joints are restored using the materials indicated
in the Workshop Manual or Parts catalogue.
Spot-welded bonded joints
In spot-welded bonded joints an electrically conductive adhesive
is used between the panels, which allows good root penetration
for spot welding.
The distance between the spot-welding/bonding surfaces should
not exceed 1 mm. The bonding surfaces may have to be aligned.
