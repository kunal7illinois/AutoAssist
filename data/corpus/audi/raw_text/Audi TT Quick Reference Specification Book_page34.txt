Identification on Crankshaft Bearing, Top
Arrow points in direction of travel.
The upper bearing shells are allocated to the cylinder block with the
correct thickness from the factory. Colored spots serve to identify
the bearing thicknesses. The letters marked on the lower sealing
surface of the cylinder block identify which bearing thickness must be
installed in which location. If color markings can no longer be read,
use the blue bearing shell. The lower crankshaft bearing shells are
always shipped as a replacement part with a yellow color marking.
