2.6 Exhaust System Components
For all exhaust system, emission control component locations,
removal/installation procedures and torque specifications, refer
to the service manual.
2.7 Secondary Air Injection System
The secondary air injection system improves the secondary oxi‐
dation within the catalytic converter which are due to the rich
mixture during the cold start phase where the exhaust emissions
contain an increased level of unburned hydrocarbons, thereby
reducing harmful emissions. The heat released by secondary ox‐
idation shortens the startup time of the catalytic converter con‐
siderably, as well as significantly improves emissions quality
during the cold-running phase.
♦ During a cold start, the secondary air injection system injects
air behind the exhaust valves. This produces an oxygen rich
exhaust gas, causes the after burning and reduces the heat‐
ing-up phase of the catalytic converter.
♦ In addition, the secondary air injection system is switched on
(after a delay) during idle after every subsequent engine start
(up to a maximum coolant temperature) and is checked
through on board diagnostic functions.
For all secondary air injection system component locations, re‐
moval/installation procedures and torque specifications, refer to
the service manual.
2.8 Ignition System
For all ignition and glow plug system component locations, re‐
moval/installation procedures and torque specifications, refer to
the service manual.
2.9 Automatic Transmission
The transmission control module receives information from trans‐
mission related components and uses this information to control
shifting and operation of the transmission.
For all automatic transmission component locations, removal/in‐
stallation procedures and torque specifications, refer to the serv‐
ice manual.
