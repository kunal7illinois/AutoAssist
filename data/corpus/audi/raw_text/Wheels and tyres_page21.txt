– Turn wheel on tyre fitting unit so that tyre valve/ tyre pressure
sensor -1- is on opposite side to head of fitting unit -2-.
– Attach retainers -3- to wheel.
– Ensure that tyre bead is seated correctly on head of fitting unit
and run tyre fitting unit in clockwise direction.
– Stop fitting upper bead before tyre valve/ tyre pressure sensor
-arrow- reaches tool; otherwise tyre pressure sensor will be
damaged.
Tyre bead will now slip over wheel flange. Make sure that tyre
fitting unit stops turning wheel before tyre valve/ tyre pressure
sensor -arrow- reaches head of fitting unit.
– Remove retainers from wheel flange.
– Inflate tyre to max. 3.3 bar (bead seating pressure).
Caution
Do not continue inflating the tyre if the beads do not make full
contact at the edge of the wheel.
The tyre or wheel will otherwise be damaged.
– If tyre beads do not make full contact at edge of wheel, release
air from tyre, press off tyre bead again and apply another gen‐
erous coating of tyre fitting lubricant to wheel flange.
– Inflate tyre to max. 3.3 bar (bead seating pressure).
– Once tyre beads have made proper contact with bead seats,
increase inflation pressure to 4 bar to seat the tyre.
– Screw in a new nickel-plated valve core and inflate tyre to
specified pressure.
– Then balance the wheel.
– Fit wheel to vehicle and tighten to specified torque.
