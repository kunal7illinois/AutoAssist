5 Notes on the direct shift gearbox 02E
5.1 General notes
Gearbox
The direct shift gearbox 02E is a dual-clutch gearbox, also refer‐
red to as “S tronic”. It has the same basic construction as a 6-
speed manual gearbox. The engine torque is transferred to the
gearbox via the dual-mass flywheel. The two multi-plate "wet"
clutches are controlled hydraulically and actuated alternately so
that the gearbox is operated like an automatic gearbox, in other
words the gears are engaged automatically (but can also be se‐
lected manually via the tiptronic function). There is no clutch
pedal. For further information please refer to ⇒ Self-study pro‐
gramme No. 308 ; Direct shift gearbox 02E .
Selector mechanism
In selector lever position “P” the selector lever cable is used to
engage the parking lock mechanically. All other gearshift com‐
mands and selector lever positions are transmitted via the CAN
data bus from the selector lever -E313- (selector mechanism) to
the mechatronic unit for dual clutch gearbox -J743- .
