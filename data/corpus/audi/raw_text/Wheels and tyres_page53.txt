Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
Caution
On vehicles with ceramic brakes the wheel must not be allowed
to drop onto the brake disc. This would cause irreparable dam‐
age to the disc. When removing or fitting a wheel, screw the
long assembly pin into the top wheel bolt hole (12 o'clock po‐
sition) in place of the wheel bolt, and screw the short pin into
one of the other holes to support the wheel. The wheel can then
slide along the assembly pins when fitting or removing it.
– First hand-tighten the lowest wheel bolt to about 30 Nm.
– Then tighten the remaining wheel bolts to about 30 Nm (in
diagonal sequence). This process centres the wheel on the
hub.
– Lower vehicle onto its wheels.
– Now use a torque wrench to tighten the wheel bolts to the
specified torque in diagonal sequence.
– Road-test vehicle.
Note
♦ If you detect vibration during the road test, this may be due to
tolerance in the wheel centring.
♦ In unfavourable circumstances, the component tolerances of
wheels and hubs could cumulate. This too can lead to vibra‐
tion. This vibration can be eliminated by using a finish balanc‐
er.
6.5 Finish balancer
Caution
Position vehicle on the sensor platforms (front wheels only on
front-wheel drive vehicle, all four wheels on four-wheel drive
vehicle) in order to balance the wheels.
Note
Before working with a finish balancer the mechanic needs to have
been instructed by the manufacturer of the balancer.
If you determine a residual imbalan c e greater than 20 grams
when balancing the wheels, you should rotate the mounting po‐
sition of the wheel on the hub.
– Mark the point at which the imbalance is indicated.
– Unbolt the wheel and rotate its position on the hub so that the
marking points downwards.
Note
Important! The hub must not rotate during this procedure.
– First hand-tighten the lowest wheel bolt to about 30 Nm.
