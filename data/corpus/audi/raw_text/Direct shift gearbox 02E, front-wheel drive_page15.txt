30 – Clutch
1 Servicing multiple clutch - exploded view
♦ The clutch in the direct shift gearbox 02E consists of two sets
of plates, and is therefore referred to as a “multiple clutch”. The
larger set of plates (located on the outside) is designated
“K 1” (clutch 1), and controls the torque flow for reverse gear
and gears “1”, “3” and “5”. The smaller set of plates (on the
inside) is designated “K 2” (clutch 2), and controls the torque
flow for gears “2”, “4” and “6”.
♦ Any work performed on the multiple clutch requires extra care
because all the parts are balanced and matched together in
production. If the components are rotated out of their original
positions when repairing, this will cause imbalance and impair
the smoothness of the gear-changes and reduce the service
life of the unit.
