9.4 Disposal
In order to be able to recycle vehicle parts after repair or servicing,
you must first collect all accumulated Audi recycling materials ac‐

– Sheet metal or iron materials (“scrap steel”) → scrap dealer
and shredder operator
– Aluminum → engine reconditioning company; scrap dealer or
special engine scrap dealer
– Tires → scrap dealer
– Plastics → Polypropylene bumpers using Audi collecting logis‐
tics at the present time, further plastic recycling projected
– Batteries → existing recycling cycle using regional disposers
– Used oil → existing disposal method
– Brake fluid → Material cycle being prepared
– Coolant → Material cycle being prepared
– Refrigerant → existing disposal method
– Refrigerant oil for R12 → such as engine oil refrigerant oil for
R134a → M a terial cycle being prepared
– Oil-filled damping equipment, e.g. bumper dampers → remove
oil and use existing disposal method
– Gas-filled damping equipment, e.g. gas-filled struts → remove
gas, absorb escaping oil and use existing disposal method
– Separate recycling materials from foreign materials to make
segregated recycling possible. For example, remove tires from
rims and use both separate disposal methods.
