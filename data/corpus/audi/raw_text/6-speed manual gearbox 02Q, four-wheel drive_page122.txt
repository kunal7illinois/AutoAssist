Note
♦ Renew self-locking nuts and bolts when performing assembly
work.
♦ Renew oil seals, gaskets, O-rings and bolts which are tight‐
ened by turning through a specified angle.
♦ All cable ties which are released or cut open during removal
must be fitted in the same position when installing.
♦ Clean input shaft splines and (in the case of a used clutch
plate) the hub splines. Remove corrosion and apply only a very
thin coating of grease for clutch plate splines -G 000 100- to
the splines. Then move clutch plate backwards and forwards
on input shaft until hub moves freely on shaft. It is important
to remove excess grease.
♦ When installing a new gearbox, the gear selector lever and
gate relay lever must be transferred to the new unit.
– Use thread tap to remove any remaining locking fluid from all
threaded holes which will accommodate self-locking bolts.
– If no dowel sleeves for centralising engine/gearbox are in the
cylinder block, install dowel sleeves.
– Make sure that the intermediate plate is engaged on the seal‐
ing flange and fitted on the dowel sleeves -arrows-.
– Check that clutch plate is centralised ⇒ page 47 .
– Check release bearing for wear. Renew clutch slave cylinder
with release bearing if necessary ⇒ page 35 .
– Raise gearbox carefully using gearbox support -3282- .
– Align gearbox with engine and install.
Vehicl e s with petrol engine:
– Guide output flange -C- on gearbox past propshaft -A- and
front exhaust pipe -B-. Rotate output flange if necessary.
