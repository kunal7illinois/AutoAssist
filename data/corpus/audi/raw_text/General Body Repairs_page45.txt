Note
♦ The vehicle can be used again immediately as soon as the
repair work has been completed.
♦ Depending on the type of damage, there is a possibility that
some traces of the damage will remain. However, this does
not have any bearing on the success of the repair job.
♦ Once the repair is completed, the windscreen can be subjec‐
ted to normal loads. The injected and hardened synthetic resin
ensures that the crack will not spread any further. The hard‐
ened resin is colourless and has the same refractive index as
the windscreen glass.
