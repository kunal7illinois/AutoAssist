Note
♦ The replacement air conditioner compressor contains the full
quantity of oil intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replace‐
ment, the quantity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is
therefore to be adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ At the start of production, exclusive use was made of air con‐
ditioner compressors of type „6 SEU 14“ manufactured by
„Denso“. This air conditioner compressor has no magnetic
clutch (it is constantly driven by the engine). Different makes
of air conditioner compressor may also be fitted at a later date
depending on the engine ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue and ⇒
Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 .
♦ As of Model Year 2008, air conditioner compressors manu‐
factured by „Sanden“ (type „PXE16“) were also gradually in‐
troduced for certain engines. This air conditioner compressor
has no magnetic clutch (it is constantly driven by the engine)

♦ This air conditioner compressor is available as a replacement
part with different oil capacities and attention must therefore
be paid to the oil quantity in the air conditioner compressor as
well as the exact part number ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep.
gr. 87 and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
