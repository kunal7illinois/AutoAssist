Caution
Avoid damage to valves and piston crowns after working on
valve gear.
♦ The hydraulic tappets have to settle; wait for approx. 30
minutes after installing camshafts before starting engine.
♦ Turn the crankshaft carefully at least 2 rotations to ensure
that none of the valves make contact when the starter is
operated.
Note
Cylinder heads with cracks between the valve seats may be used
without reducing engine life, provided the cracks are small and
not more than 0.5 mm wide.
