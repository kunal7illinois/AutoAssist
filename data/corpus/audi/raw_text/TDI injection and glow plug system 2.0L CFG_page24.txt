To ensure the proper function of the air mass meter -G70- it is
important to observe the following instructions.
Note
♦ If the air filter element is very dirty or wet, dirt or water could
reach the air mass meter and affect the air mass value. This
would lead to loss of power, since a smaller injection quantity
is calculated.
♦ Always use genuine part for air filter element.
♦ Always renew seal if damaged (air leaks in intake system).
♦ Use a silicone-free lubricant when installing the air hose and
seal.
♦ Hose connections and air pipes and hoses must be free of oil
and grease before assembly.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct type of hose clips
(same as original equipment) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
– Check for salt residue, dirt and leaves in air mass meter and
air intake hose (engine intake side).
– Check for dirt in air duct leading to air filter element. If neces‐
sary, clean salt residue, dirt and leaves out of air cleaner
housing (top and bottom sections); wash out or use a vacuum
cleaner as required.
