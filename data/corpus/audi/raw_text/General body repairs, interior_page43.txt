5.6 Calibrating digital compass
It is necessary to calibrate the digital compass if:
♦ The directions the digital compass shows are inaccurate.
♦ The compass display shows a „C“ instead of a point of the
compass, or if the display remains blank.
♦ A new automatic anti-dazzle interior mirror -Y7- is installed.
In exceptional circumstances, the digital compass may also have
to be calibrated, for example if:
♦ The vehicle battery is reconnected after being disconnected
for a long period,
♦ A new audio system or audio system components has/have
been fitted
Calibrating digital compass:
– Switch on ignition.
Compass display -1- should show „C“.
– If display does not show „C“, press and hold button -2- for 9 to
12 seconds until letter „C“ appears in compass display -1-.
– Drive the vehicle in a circle two or three times at a speed of
approx. 5 mph (10 km/h) until a direction is indicated on the
compass display -1-.
– Make sure you switch the anti-dazzle function of the interior
mirror back on ⇒ page 30 after completing the calibration
process.
