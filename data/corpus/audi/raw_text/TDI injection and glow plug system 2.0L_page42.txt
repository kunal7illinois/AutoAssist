Note
No dirt must be allowed to get into the disconnected return lines
or the open connections on the injectors.
– Connect hoses onto return line connections of all 4 injectors.
– Run the 4 hoses into injection rate comparison meter -V.A.G

– Start engine and let it idle for several minutes.
Caution
Do NOT press the accelerator during this test; the engine must
only run at idling speed.
Running the engine at higher speeds with the return lines dis‐
connected will cause damage to the injectors.
– When the engine is warm and running at idling speed, the re‐
turn flow rates at each of the 4 return lines must not differ by
more than a small amount.
– If one injector has a significantly higher return flow rate than
the others it must be renewed ⇒ page 42 .
Installing fuel return lines
– Renew O-rings for all return line connections.
Note
Lubricate all O-rings with engine oil or assembly oil before instal‐
ling.
– Push the return line connections carefully over the new seals
and onto the injectors. The catch should engage audibly. Then
press release pin down carefully.
– Check fuel system for leaks ⇒ page 55 .
