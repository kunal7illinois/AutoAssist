Checking piston
– Measure as follows using micrometer, 75 … 100 mm:
• Approx. 6 mm from the bottom of piston skirt.
• At 90° to piston pin axis.
Maximum deviation from nominal dimension:
• 0.04 mm (maximum)
Nominal dimension
⇒ “4.2 Piston and cylinder dimensions”, page 68 .
Checking cylinder bore
– Measure as follows using cylinder gauge, 50 … 100 mm:
• At 3 positions in both lateral direction -A- and longitudinal di‐
rection -B-.
Maximum deviation from nominal dimension:
• 0.08 mm (maximum)
Nominal dimension
⇒ “4.2 Piston and cylinder dimensions”, page 68 .
Install piston with funnel -T10147- .
Note
If a new funnel -T10147- is used to install the pistons, first pass
piston (with oiled piston rings) twice through the funnel and re‐
move any resulting swarf. Then install piston with piston rings.
– Lubricate funnel and push piston in by hand.
• The flat side of the piston crown must face the projection on
the fitting tool -arrow-.
– Hold upper part of tool (with piston inserted) and press piston
in with both thumbs.
– Push piston in until it protrudes approx. 15 mm from the lower
edge of the fitting tool.
– Place piston in appropriate cylinder bore.
• Projection on funnel -arrow- must face centre of cylinder block.
– Hold fitting tool firmly against cylinder block and push in the
piston.
