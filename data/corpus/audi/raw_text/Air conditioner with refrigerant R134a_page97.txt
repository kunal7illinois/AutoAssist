Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Pouring in leak detection additive with refrigerant circuit charged
Note
♦ Heed the following if leak detection fluid has already been
poured into a refrigerant circuit in the course of previous repair
work: Only pour in fresh leak detection fluid if the refrigerant
oil is replaced. If only a certain amount of refrigerant oil has
been replaced, just add the corresponding quantity of leak de‐
tection fluid. After replacing 100 ml of refrigerant oil on a
vehicle containing 250 ml for example, just add 1 ml (cm3 ) of
leak detection additive.
♦ A small quantity of leak detection additive remains in the serv‐
ice connection. This is to be carefully removed so as to avoid
subsequent erroneous leak detection.
The cartridge -A- contains 15.4 ml of leak detection additive (one
unit -B- corresponds to 2.5 ml).
– Switch off ignition.
– Detach cap from service connection on low-pressure side of
refrigerant circuit.
– Assemble hand pump -VAS 6201- , item -1- with cartridge,
item -2- -VAS 6201/2- .
– Insert the tube -VAS 6201/8- ( ⇒ page 90 item -7-) in the serv‐
ice coupling and open the service coupling by screwing in the
handwheel. Hold the hose upwards and screw in the toggle of
the hand pump until the leak detection additive starts to
emerge from the tube.
Note
Make sure hand pump hose is completely filled with refrigerant.
– Close service coupling and remove filler tube from locking
mechanism.
