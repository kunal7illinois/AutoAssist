Seating of tyres with run-flat capability (PAX)
Due to the construction of the tyre, it remains firmly attached to
the wheel in all driving situations.
A wedged-shaped component of the tyre is thereby pressed be‐
tween the bead core and rim by the load. This occurs regardless
of the tyre pressure.
Dimensions of tyres with run-flat capability (PAX)
As compared to standard tyres, run-flat tyres (PAX) have different
dimensions and designations.
Run-flat tyres (PAX) can therefore only be fitted to special wheels
designed for the PAX system.
1 - Width in millimetres: tyre width from sidewall to sidewall on
the standard rim (corresponds to the width dimension on
standard tyres)
2 - Outer diameter in millimetres: maximum diameter of the new
tyre
3 - Nominal diameter in millimetres on standardised rim seat
4 - Small bead diameter in millimetres: outer rim seat
5 - Larger bead diameter in millimetres: inner rim seat
