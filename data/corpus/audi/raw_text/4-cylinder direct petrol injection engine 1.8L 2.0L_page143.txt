Note
♦ Cylinder head and cylinder head cover must be renewed to‐
gether.
♦ After installing camshafts, wait for approx. 30 minutes before
starting engine. The hydraulic compensation elements must
settle (otherwise valves will strike pistons).
♦ After working on the valve gear, turn the engine carefully at
least 2 rotations to ensure that none of the valves make con‐
tact when the starter is operated.
♦ Always fit new seals and gaskets.
