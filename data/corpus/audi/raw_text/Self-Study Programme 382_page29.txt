Integration of the function into the vehicle
The "electrically adjustable rear spoiler" function is implemented in the convenience system central control
unit J393. The control unit activates the adjustable rear spoiler motor V52 and reads in the two limit switches
F135 and F136, which are used to identify both limit positions of the rear spoiler.
The convenience system control unit J393 also reads in the adjustable rear spoiler switch E127 and activates
the adjustable rear spoiler warning lamp K242 in the button according to the current status.
