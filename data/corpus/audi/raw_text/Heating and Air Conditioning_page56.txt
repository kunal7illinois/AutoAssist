attaching
Note
♦ Heed the notes on pulley replacement ⇒ page 49 .
♦ Perform the preparatory work as for pulley detachment
⇒ page 48 .
♦ The pulley is made of plastic, is sensitive to impact and should
therefore be treated with extreme care.
♦ If the overload safeguard of the driv e plate -C- has been trip‐
ped, remove the circlip -A- and then prise the drive plate off
the pulley -D-.
♦ Circlips -A- with a vulcanised rubber disc are fitted to minimise
noise ⇒ page 49 and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue . This rub‐
ber disc reduces the rattling (castanet-like) noise which can
occur at the pulley particularly in the case of vehicles with die‐
sel engine in air conditioner “Econ” mode (“AC off”) (in air
conditioner full-load operation the noise is scarcely audible).
