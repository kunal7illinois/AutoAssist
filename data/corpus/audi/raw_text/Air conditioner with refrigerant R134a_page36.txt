Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.5.9 Air conditioning system compressor
speed sender -G111-
Inductive sender
The sender pulses (4 per compressor revolution) and the engine
speed enable the operating and display unit for Climatronic air
conditioning system -E87- or the Climatronic control unit -J255-
to calculate the belt slip.
If the belt slip exceeds a specified value, the air conditioner com‐
pressor is switched off by the control unit via the magnetic clutch.
Note
♦ Fitted in Audi vehicles with compressor driven via poly V-belt
and Zexel compressor ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr.
87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific work‐
shop manual).
♦ The logo of the compressor manufacturer „Zexel“ affixed to the
air conditioner compressor was switched as of year of pro‐
duction 2006 (when the manufacturer's name changed) from
„Zexel“ to the new name „Valeo“.
2.5.10 Refrigerant temperature sender -G454-
The refrigerant temperature sender (with a temperature-sensitive
resistor) is installed, for example, in the high-pressure pipe next
to the air conditioner compressor.
In the refrigerant circuit, there is a direct relationshi p between
temperature and pressure. If there is insufficient refrigerant in the
circuit, the temperature in the refrigerant circuit during air condi‐
tioner operation will increase more sharply than envisaged for this
pressure.
Note
♦ Fitted, for example, on the Audi Q7 with certain engines ⇒ Air
conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop manual)
and ⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical fault finding and Fitting
locations
♦ The operating and display unit, Climatronic control unit -J255-
evaluates the pressure and the temperature in the refrigerant
circuit and switches off the air conditioner compressor if the
temperature increases above the value stored for this pres‐
sure ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific work‐
shop manual) and ⇒ Vehicle diagnostic tester ( „Self-
diagnosis“ or „Guided fault-finding“ function for the air
conditioner).
