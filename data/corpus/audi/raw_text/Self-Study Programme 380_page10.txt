Occupant protection
Airbag control unit J234
Airbag control unit J234 and integrated electronics have the task of detecting a collision.
In the Audi TT Coupé ‘07 the airbag control unit is attached to the vehicle body in the area of the handbrake
lever.
The airbag control unit is integrated in the CAN powertrain data bus so that it can exchange information with
other control units.
The airbag electronics basically have the following
main tasks:
– Collision detection (front, side, rear)
– Defined deployment of the belt tensioners,
airbags and battery disconnect
– Defined deployment of the second front airbag
stage
– Evaluation of all input information
– Permanent monitoring of the complete airbag
system
– Independent energy supply via capacitor for
a defined period of time
(approx. 150 ms)
– Fault display via failure warning lamp
– Storage of error / and crash information
– Indication of a collision event to other system 380_008
components via the powertrain CAN bus or
discrete collision output (conventionally wired)
– Activate seat belt reminder
To find out which components need replacing after an accident, refer to the valid Workshop Manual in
ElsaWin.
An airbag control unit can only be replaced with a VAS tester running the "Guided Fault Finding" or "Guided
Functions" application.
