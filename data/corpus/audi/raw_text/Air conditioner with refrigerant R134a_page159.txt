Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ If a vehicle is fitted with a yellow-coloured restrictor as re‐
placement for a non-coloured restrictor, add 50 g more refrig‐
erant than specified in the table. In addition, the capacity
specified on the label in the vehicle is to be checked and
amended if necessary or the existing label is to be replaced
with one indicating the correct capacity (affix over old label).
♦ Restrictors with modified hole (coloured) have been installed
at the factory since November 1997. In order to distinguish
between the two restrictor versions, the one with the smaller
hole (1.54 mm) is yellow-coloured. The restrictor with the larg‐
er hole (1.83 mm) is not coloured.
♦ The Audi 100 / Audi A6 features different air conditioner com‐
pressors depending on the engine and production period.
Exclusive use was made at the start of production of „Zexel /
Valeo“ air conditioner compressors. As of Model Year 1996,
„Denso“ air conditioner compressors were gradually intro‐
duced for vehicles with 6-cylinder engines.
♦ The air conditioner compressor designation „Zexel / Valeo“
was changed as of 2006 to „Valeo“.
♦ From September 1994, production was gradually switched
from condenser 4A0 260 403 AB to condenser 4A0 260 403
AC.
♦ The refrigerant capacity of 750+50 g applies to all Audi 100
models (regardless of condenser).
♦ Only condensers with part number 4A0 260 403 AC are now
available as replacement parts (if necessary use label, part no.
8A0 010 126 P).
♦ After charging the refrigerant circuit of vehicles manufactured
up to October 1994, check the capacity stated on the label in
the vehicle and amend if necessary or affix the label, part no.
