Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ If, for example, 70 cm3 of refrigerant oil has been poured out
of the defective air conditioner compressor and 220 cm3 out
of the replacement compressor (a small quantity of refrigerant
oil remains in the air conditioner compressor), fill the air con‐
ditioner compressor to be installed with 70 cm3 of refrigerant
oil (use can be made of the oil poured out of the replacement
compressor).
♦ Use different refrigerant oils and quantities for the various air
conditioner compressors ⇒ page 144 .
♦ If a greater quantity of refrigerant oil (more than approx. 80
cm3 ) has been poured out of the defective air conditioner com‐
pressor, the remaining refrigerant oil can also be added to the
evaporator or reservoir/receiver ⇒ page 144 .
– Renew restrictor.
– Assemble, evacuate and charge refrigerant circuit.
8.1.4 Replacing air conditioner compressor
on account of leakage or internal dam‐
age
For example due to noise from the air conditioner compressor or
no air conditioner compressor output
– Drain the refrigerant circuit.
– Remove the air conditioner compressor.
Note
♦ In the event of internal (air conditioner compressor) damage,
check the refrigerant hoses and condenser. If, e.g. swarf has
ingressed, clean the refrigerant hoses and condenser (flush
with refrigerant R134a ⇒ page 59 or blow out with compressed
air or nitrogen ⇒ page 55 ) and replace the refrigerant hoses
if necessary.
♦ On vehicles with two evaporators, the quantity of refrigerant
oil in the refrigerant circuit may be greater than the quantity in
the replacement compressor. On such vehicles, add the extra
quantity of refrigerant oil to the refrigerant circuit as necessary
⇒ page 55 .
– Renew dryer cartridge, receiver or reservoir and restrictor.
– Check expansion valve for dirt or corrosion and renew if nec‐
essary
– Assemble, evacuate and charge refrigerant circuit.
8.1.5 Renewing receiver or reservoir and re‐
strictor after cleaning refrigerant circuit
Note
Cleaning refrigerant circuit means flushing with refrigerant R134a
⇒ page 59 or blowing out with compressed air or nitrogen
⇒ page 55 .
