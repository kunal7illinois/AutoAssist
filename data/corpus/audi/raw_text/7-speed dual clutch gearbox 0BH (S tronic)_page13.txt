Caution
When the vehicle is towed, the selector lever must be set to
position „N“ and the vehicle must not be towed for a distance
of more than 50 km or at a speed in excess of 50 km/h, as the
gearbox would otherwise be seriously damaged.
Note
It is not possible to start the engine by means of tow-starting, for
instance in the case of insufficient battery charge or if the starter
