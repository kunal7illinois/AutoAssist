Joining techniques and production processes
New joining technique: aluminium laser welding
(invisible roof seam)
Laser welding has been used for joining aluminium body parts since the launch of the Audi A2. In most cases,
sheet-metal parts are welded onto castings or extruded parts. The invisible joint in the roof area is joined
using a new joining technique: laser welding.
