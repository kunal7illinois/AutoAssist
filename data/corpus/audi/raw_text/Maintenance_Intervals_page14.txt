The time-sensitive maintenance items table contains additional
maintenance items
1) First minor maintenance service at 5,000 miles (8,000 km) or 1 year after de‐
livery, whichever occurs first.
2) First major maintenance service at 15,000 miles (25,000 km) or 1 year after the
first minor service, whichever occurs first. Maintenance Services thereafter occur
at 10,000 mile (15,000 km) intervals or 1 year from last service, whichever occurs
first (alternating between minor and major services).
The intervals shown in this table are based on vehicles operating
under normal conditions. In case of severe conditions, such as
extremely low temperatures, excessive dust, etc., it is necessary
for certain operations to be carried out in between the given in‐
tervals. This applies particularly to engine oil changes and the
cleaning or replacing of the air cleaner filter element.
