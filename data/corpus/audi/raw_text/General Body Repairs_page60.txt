24 Flanging
The outer side panel is already hardened when it is supplied as
a replacement part.
Flanging therefore requires a special procedure, which is carried
out in 2 stages.
– 1. Use pliers to bend up flange. Maintain a radius of R = 2.5
mm.
– 2. Fold over upper area using a hammer and counterhold tool.
Radius of R = 2.5 mm must be maintained.
The side panel may rupture if radius is not maintained.
Full-surface bonding between inner and outer sections must be
ensured throughout the shaded area.
