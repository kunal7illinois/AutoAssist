Power brake unit / brake servo
In the case of the 16" systems, 10" single brake ser-
vos are used on left-hand-drive models and 7/8" tan-
dem brake servos on right-hand drive models.
Vehicles with 17" systems are equipped with 11" sin-
gle brake servos for left-hand-drive models and with
7/8" tandem brake servos for right-hand drive mod-
els.
For the Audi TT, no dual rate characteristic* was
applied to the brake servo.
The OHB-V function known from the Audi A3 * was
implemented on vehicles with 3.2l VR6 engine and
dual-clutch gearbox.

* dual rate and OHB-V are described in SSP 313
Like in Audi A3 models after November 2005, the
contactless brake light sensor is used on the Audi
TT. Brake light and brake test switches are no longer
required on the brake pedal.
The pedal assembly has been adopted from the
Audi A3.
