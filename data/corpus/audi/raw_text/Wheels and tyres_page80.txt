12.7 Repairing tyres with run-flat capability
(PAX)
General information
It is not always necessary to renew a tyre after it has lost pressure
and then been run in an uninflated condition.
Note
The affected tyre should be removed and checked for damage by
qualified personnel. Fitting of tyres and checking tyres for damage
must only be carried out by qualified personnel.
After a run-flat tyre (PAX) has lost inflation pressure, check the
tyre as follows:
– First remove as much gel residue from the tyre as possible.
Use the flat side of the putty knife to do so.
– Then clean away any remaining gel residue from the tyre and
support ring using water and a cloth.
– After separating the tyre and support ring, check both compo‐
nents (PAX) according to the following criteria.
Notes:
– When re-installing, make sure the support ring is the correct
size for the tyre and wheel dimensions.
– As with standard tyre/wheel systems, the PAX wheel must al‐
so be checked before fitting.
– Damaged wheels must be renewed.
12.8 PAX tyres - assessing condition
When checking a tyre, look out especially for the following criteria:
♦ Surface erosion or ripples on the inner side (inflation pressure
was too low or not sufficient for the load)
♦ Loose rubber or loose radial threads
♦ Separated or deformed bead core
