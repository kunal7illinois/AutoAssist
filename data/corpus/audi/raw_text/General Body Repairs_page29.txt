SG shielded arc welding of galvanised panels
The following notes must be observed in order to achieve high-
quality shielded-arc welded joints:
♦ Increase current setting (Ampere) on welding transformer.
♦ At the same time the wire feed must be regulated, as the volt‐
age increase on its own merely results in a greater arc (less
penetration, more porous seam structure).
♦ Use cylindrical as opposed to conical gas nozzle (spatter oc‐
curring if gas nozzle is too narrow causes pore formation).
♦ Guide the torch about 12 mm above the panels being welded
at a neutral angle / at an angle up to 10°.
♦ Use the softest wire grade possible.
♦ Both CO2 and mixed gases may be used as inert gas.
