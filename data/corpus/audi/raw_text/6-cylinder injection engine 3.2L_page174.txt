Removing
Note
Even when the radiator and co ndenser are correctly installed,
slight impressions may be visible on the fins of these components.
This does not mean that the components are damaged. If the fins
are only very slightly distorted, this does not justify renewal of the
radiator or the condenser.
WARNING
Hot steam/hot coolant can escape - risk of scalding.
♦ The cooling system is under pressure when the engine is
hot.
♦ Cover filler cap on expansion tank with a cloth and open
carefully to dissipate pressure.
– Open filler cap on expansion tank.
