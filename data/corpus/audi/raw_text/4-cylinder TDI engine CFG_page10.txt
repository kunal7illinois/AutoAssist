3.2 Working on the cooling system
When working on the cooling system note the following:
WARNING
Hot steam/hot coolant can escape - risk of scalding.
♦ The cooling system is under pressure when the engine is
hot.
♦ To allow pressure to dissipate, cover filler cap on coolant
expansion tank with cloth and open carefully.
Risk of injury as the radiator fans may start up automatically.
♦ Unplug electrical connectors before starting to work in the
area of radiator cowl.
Caution
Overheating can occur if the filler cap is not fitted properly.
♦ Close filler cap on coolant expansion tank (make sure it
engages).
3.3 Working on vehicles with start/stop sys‐
tem
When performing repairs on vehicles with start/stop system, note
the following:
WARNING
Risk of injury due to automatic engine start on vehicles with
start/stop system.
♦ On vehicles with activated start/stop system (this is indi‐
cated by a message in the instrument cluster display), the
engine may start automatically on demand.
♦ Therefore it is important to ensure that the start/stop sys‐
tem is deactivated when performing repairs (switch off
ignition, if required switch on ignition again).
