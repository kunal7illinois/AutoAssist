The threads of the two shear bolts -3- which are screwed into the
engine control unit are not secured with locking fluid. Do not apply
heat to the threads in the control unit housing; this is not neces‐
sary and would cause overheating of the control unit.
Select settings on hot air blower as shown in illustration, i.e. set
temperature potentiometer -2- to maximum heat output and two-
stage air flow switch -3- to position 3.
WARNING
Heating the thread of the locking plate also heats up the shear
bolts and parts of the metal housing. Take care to avoid burns.
It is also important to ensure that only the thread is heated and
none of the surrounding components if at all possible. These
should be covered if necessary.
Apply heat to the threads of the shear bolts on the connector side
as shown in the illustration.
Switch on the hot air blower and heat the bolt for approximately
20 ... 30 seconds.
– Unscrew shear bolts using suitable vice-grip pliers (see arrow
in illustration).
– The two shear bolts screwed into the engine control unit do
not need to be heated. They can be removed without heating.
– Detach metal locking plate from connectors.
– Unscrew two bolts securing retainers for engine control unit -
