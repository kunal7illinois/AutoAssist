To prevent the pressure plate from becoming distorted during in‐
stallation (causes clutch grab when driving off), always adhere to
the following procedure when installing the pressure plate:
– Make sure that the stop pin (position sensor) -arrow- is free to
move.
– Screw in all 6 bolts evenly by hand until bolt heads make con‐
tact with pressure plate.
– Working clockwise, tighten all six bolts consecutively in steps
of 90° (1/4 turn) until the housing makes contact with the fly‐
wheel.
• The stop pin -arrow- should then lift away from the pressure
plate.
– Working clockwise, tighten all 6 bolts to final torque consecu‐
tively. Tightening torque ⇒ Item 4 (page 37) .
