12.5 Inflating tyres on PAX wheels
Observe the following important points when inflating the tyre:
– Only inflate after fitting the tyre with valve core installed. Check
whether the beads have properly seated at 1 bar.
– If one of the beads is not seated properly, do not let air out of
the tyre, but apply the fitting roller to the appropriate bead and
press on lightly while turning. The bead will then seat itself
properly.
– Then fill up with air until the specified inflation pressure for the
vehicle is reached. Tyre gas for standard tyres can also be
used.
Note
Do NOT overfill tyre (e.g. up to 3.5 bar), even briefly, as is per‐
missible with standard tyres.
12.6 Wheel alignment
The procedure for adjusting the wheel alignment on vehicles with
run-flat tyres (PAX) is the same as for vehicles with standard
tyres.
Generally, the same measuring heads and fasteners for standard
tyres with rim protector can be used on PAX wheels. (Fit to the
inner side, secure to tyre tread).
