Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.2.12 Pressure relief valve
The pressure relief valve is attached to the air conditioner com‐
pressor or receiver.
The valve opens at a pressure of approx. 38 bar and closes again
when the pressure has dropped (approx. 30 bar).
Not all the refrigerant escapes.
Certain versions feature a transparent plastic disc which breaks
off as soon as the valve responds.
