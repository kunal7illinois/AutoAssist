Caution
Avoid damage to valves and piston crowns after working on
valve gear.
♦ The hydraulic tappets have to settle; wait for approx. 30
minutes after installing camshafts before starting engine.
♦ Turn the engine carefully at least 2 rotations to ensure that
none of the valves make contact when the starter is op‐
erated.
Note
Cylinder heads which have cracks between the valve seats or
between a valve seat insert and the spark plug thread can be re-
installed without reducing service life, provided the cracks are
only slight and do not exceed a maximum of 0.3 mm in width, and
no more than the first 4 turns of the spark plug threads are
cracked.
