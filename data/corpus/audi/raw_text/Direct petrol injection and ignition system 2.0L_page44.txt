Audi TT 2007 ➤
Direct petrol injection and ignition system (4-cyl. 2.0 ltr. 4-valve turbo) - Edition 01.2008
– Screw connector -V.A.G 1318/23- and adapter -
V.A.G 1318/17-1- onto K-Jetronic tester -V.A.G 1318- .
– Fit adapter -V.A.G 1318/17-1- onto the disconnected fuel sup‐
ply pipe.
– Screw adapter -V.A.G 1318/11- onto K-Jetronic tester -V.A.G
1318- .
– Attach test hose -arrow- and hold end of hose in measuring
container.
– Open cut-off valve on K-Jetronic pressure tester -V.A.G
1318- . Lever must point in direction of flow.
– Bleed fuel system by pressing remote control button briefly.
– Close cut-off valve on K-Jetronic pressure tester -V.A.G
1318- . Lever is at right angle to direction of flow -arrow-.
– Press and hold remote control switch until K-Jetronic pressure
tester -V.A.G 1318- shows no further increase in pressure.
• Specification: approx. 6 bar (4 ...8 bar)
If specification is not obtained:
– Check delivery rate of fuel pump ⇒ Fuel supply system, petrol
engines; Rep. Gr. 20 .
Checking residual pressure
– Check leak-tightness and residual pressure by watching the
drop in pressure on the K-Jetronic pressure tester -V.A.G
1318- .
• After 10 minutes pressure should still be at least 3 bar.
If the residual pressure drops below 3 bar:
♦ Check union between K-Jetronic pressure tester -V.A.G 1318-
and fuel supply line for leaks.
♦ Check K-Jetronic pressure tester -V.A.G 1318- for leaks.
♦ Check fuel lines and their connections for leaks.
♦ Renew fuel filter with integrated fuel pressure regulator ⇒ Fuel
supply system, petrol engines; Rep. Gr. 20 . Then repeat the
test.
♦ If fuel filter is OK, renew fuel pump ⇒ Fuel supply system,
petrol engines; Rep. Gr. 20 .
Assembly is carried out in the reverse order; note the following:
– The ignition must be switched off.
Note
Before removing the pressure tester, release the fuel p ressure by
opening the cut-off valve. Hold auxiliary hose in a co n tainer.
– Re-attach fuel supply line (make sure that all parts are clean
and that there are no leaks).
