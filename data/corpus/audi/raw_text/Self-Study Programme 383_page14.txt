Joining techniques and production processes
MIG welding
Aluminium parts have largely been joined by means of metal inert gas welding since the launch of the Audi
aluminium bodyshell in the Audi A8 (1994) . This technique is principally used to make joints between castings
and extruded sections, as well as sheet-metal parts.
This joining technique is notable for producing high-strength joints, but it introduces a great deal of heat into
the joint and has a relatively slow process speed.

Resistance spot welding and MAG welding
The usual techniques of resistance spot welding and, to a lesser extent, metal active gas welding (MAG weld-
ing) are used for joining sheet steel body parts in steel body manufacturing.
