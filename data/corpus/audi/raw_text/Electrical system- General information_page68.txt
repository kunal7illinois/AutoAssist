Caution
♦ Do not touch the glass part of the gas discharge bulb with
bare hands. The remaining fingerprint would be evapora‐
ted by the heat of the bulb when it is switched on, become
deposited on the reflector and thus impair the brightness
of the headlight. Wear clean fabric gloves when fitting the
gas discharge bulb.
♦ Only replace defective gas discharge bulbs with gas dis‐
charge bulbs of the same type. The type can be found on
the base of the bulb or on the glass part of the bulb.
♦ When installing, make sure connectors engage properly
and are securely attached.
