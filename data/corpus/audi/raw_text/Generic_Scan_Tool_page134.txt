1 T94/20
2 T94/1
3 pin 30 of J496
Specified value: 1.5 Ω Max.
If the specification was not obtained:
– Check the wiring for a short circuit to each other, Battery (+),
or Ground (GND).
– Check the electrical harness connector for damage, corrosion,
loose or broken terminals.
– If necessary, Repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is detected in the wiring:
– Erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”, page 15
– Perform a road test to verify Repair.
If the DTC does not return:
Repair complete, Generate readiness code. Refer to
⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
– End diagnosis.
If the DTC does return and no malfunction is detected in the wiring
and the voltage supply was OK:
– Replace the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- . Refer to
appropriate Repair manual.
– Assembly is performed in the r e verse of the removal.
Final procedures
After the Repair work, the following work steps must be performed
in the following sequence:
1 - Check the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Memory”,
page 14 .
2 - If necessary, erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
3 - If the DTC memory was erased, generate readiness code.
Refer to ⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
