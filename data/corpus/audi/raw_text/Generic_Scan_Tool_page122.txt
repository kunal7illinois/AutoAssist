Generic Scan Tool - Edition 07.2011
– Connect the multimeter positive lead to terminal -1- of the Fuel
Pump Control Module harness connector.
– Turn the Ignition key to the ON position.
– The meter should read within 1 V of battery voltage.
– If voltage is below specification, locate wiring fault in ground
or power circuit. Refer to wiring diagram for location.
– If voltage is OK, connect multimeter positive lead to terminal
-3- of the Fuel Pump Control Module harness connector. The
ground lead remains on terminal -6-
– Crank the engine and note voltage displayed on multimeter
during crank. Voltage should be within 2.5 volts of battery volt‐
age.
– If voltage is below specification, locate wiring fault in the power
circuit. Refer to wiring diagram for location.
– If voltage is OK, connect multimeter positive lead to terminal
-2- of the Fuel Pump Control Module harness connector. The
ground lead remains on terminal -6-
– Crank the engine and note voltage displayed on multimeter
during crank. Voltage should be 3.2 volts (+/- .4)
– If voltage is below specification, check circuit from Fuel Pump
Control Module to ECM for open, short or high resistance and
repair as necessary. If no circuit fault is found, replace ECM.
– If voltage is OK, reconnect the wiring harness to the Fuel Pump
control Module.
Test procedure for Fuel P ump Control Module
– Remove the floor sealing cover to access the Fuel Delivery
Unit (fuel pump).
– Disconnect the harness connector from the Fuel Delivery Unit.
– Connect the multimeter positive lead to terminal -1- of the Fuel
Delivery Unit harness connector.
– Connect the multimeter ground lead to terminal -5- of the Fuel
Delivery Unit harness connector.
– Crank the engine and note voltage displayed on multimeter
during crank. Voltage should be within 2.5 volts of battery volt‐
age.
– If voltage is below specification, replace the Fuel Pump Con‐
trol Module (J538).
– If voltage is within specification, replace the Fuel Pump (G6).
Refer to appropriate service manual.
Final procedures
After the repair work, the following work steps must be performed
in the following sequence:
1 - Check the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Memory”,
page 14 .
2 - If necessary, erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
3 - If the DTC memory was erased, generate readiness code.
Refer to ⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
