to Battery (+) or Ground.
– Check the electrical connections for damage, corrosion, loose
or broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection and replace

Specified value: 1.5 Ω Max.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Check the wiring for an open circuit, a short circuit to each
other, Battery (+) or Ground.

loose or broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is found in the wiring and voltage supply was
OK:
– Replace the Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Pump Relay -
J299- .
– Erase the DTC memory.
– Perform a road test to verify repair.
Final procedures
After repair work, the following work steps must be performed in
the following sequence:
1 - Check the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Memory”,
page 14 .
2 - If necessary, erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
3 - If the DTC memory was erased, generate readiness code.
Refer to ⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
