3.3.2 Diagnostic Mode 02 - Read Operating
Conditions
When an emissions-related fault (pending DTC, visible in mode
07) is first detected, operating conditions are stored. Mode 02
makes it possible to access this freeze frame data as soon as this
fault is shown in mode 03. Each control module only shows freeze
frame data for one fault via mode 02. Therefore, there are two
priority levels. If there is a malfunction with higher priority, the
freeze frame data is overwritten.
– Fault with higher priority: Misfire malfunction or fuel trim mal‐
function.
– Fault with normal priority: All other emissions-related faults.
Note
Depending on scan tool and protocol used, the information in di‐
agnostic mode 02 may be referred to by different names such as
Test-ID (TID), Hex-ID, Component-ID (CID), or On-Board Diag‐
nostic Monitor Identifier (OBDMID).
