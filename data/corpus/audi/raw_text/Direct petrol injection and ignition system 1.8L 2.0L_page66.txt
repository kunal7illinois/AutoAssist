– Connect pressure line of pressure sensor tester -VAS 6394-
to adapter -VAS 6394/2- .
– Start engine.
– Compare the pressure indicated by pressure sensor tester -
VAS 6394/1- with the actual pressure value on the vehicle
diagnostic tester .
• The pressure readings must not deviate by more than 5 bar.
– If the deviation is more than 5 bar, test a new fuel pressure
sender -G247- .
WARNING
The fuel system is pressurised. The fuel pressure in the high-
pressure part of the injection system must be reduced to a
residual pressure prior to opening; for procedure see
⇒ page 4 .
– Screw a new fuel pressure sender -G247- into the pressure
gauge -VAS 639 4/1- .
– Repeat the test with the new fuel pressure sender -G247- and
compare the two pressure values.
If the two values still do not agree:
– Check the electrical connection between the fuel pressure
sender -G247- and the engine control unit; refer to ⇒ Current
flow diagrams, Electrical fault finding and Fitting locations.
If the values agree:
– Install the new fuel pressure sender -G247- ⇒ page 59 .
