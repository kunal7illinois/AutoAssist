10.2 Removing and installing gear oil filter
On some vehicles it is not possible to remove the gear oil filter
with the gearbox in the vehicle. The gear oil filter comes into con‐
tact with the cylinder head. In this case the gearbox must be
detached from the engine.
If the cylinder head has a flattened surface in the vicinity of the
gear oil filter, the filter can be removed and installed with the
gearbox in the vehicle.
Note
♦ The gear oil filter does not normally have to be renewed.
♦ When does the gear oil filter have to be changed? ⇒ page 6
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Used oil collection and extraction unit -V.A.G 1782-
Removing
– Remove air cleaner housing ⇒ Injection and ignition system;
Rep. gr. 24 .
– Place used oil collection and extraction unit -V.A.G 1782- be‐

Note
♦ A residual amount of oil remains in the filter. This comes out
when the filter housing is unscrewed.
♦ Before unscrewing the filter housing, cover the area round the
oil filter with a sufficient number of cloths.
♦ To allow the gear oil to drain back into the gearbox from the
gear oil filter housing, tilt the housing slightly in its seat before
removing it.
