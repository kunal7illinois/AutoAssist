The Audi iPod adaptor can be used to connect the Apple iPod to radios with communication CAN bus. The
adaptor converts the CD changer messages from the radio for the iPod. It can be connected as an alternative
to the CD changer. Simultaneous operation of the CD changer and iPod adaptor is not possible, because both
devices use the same port on the radio. All iPods with
Dock Connector, a 30-pin blade terminal, can be connected to the adaptor iPod. Models without a Dock
Connector, e.g. with USB port only, cannot be connected to the iPod adaptor.
The iPod adaptor allows the iPod to be operated
using the CD changer control functions. The
displays on radios or navigation systems support
only CD changers with max. 6 discs and max. 99
tracks per CD. For this reason, they cannot display
folders, artists and tracks like the iPod display.
To overcome this system limitation of the CD
changer interface, an operating concept adapted to
the interface has been developed.
