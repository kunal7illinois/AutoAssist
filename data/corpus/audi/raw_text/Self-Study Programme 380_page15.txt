Foil
The workshop manual (ElsaWin) applicable to the
vehicle describes the tests which must be made to
detect an activated belt tensioner (band tensioner).
An activated belt tensioner can be detected, among
other things, by virtue of the fact that the foil
located on the side of the belt tensioner housing is
detached from the housing.
