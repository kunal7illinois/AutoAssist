2.5 Adjusting wiper arms
Procedure
Note
If the wiper motor needs to be run during repair work, the bonnet
must be closed (voltage supply to wiper motor is cut off when
bonnet is open).
– Remove wiper arms ⇒ page 60 .
– Switch on ignition.
– Operate „touch-wipe function“ and allow wiper motor to move
to end position.
Note
♦ Every second time the wiper motor is switched off it runs back
slightly after reaching the end position, which turns the lip of
the wiper blade in the opposite direction.
♦ The wiper motor moves the wiper arms down beyond their end
position and then back up slightly. This slightly raised position
must not be used when aligning the wiper crank.
♦ You must use the end setting at which the wiper motor moves
directly to its park position (without returning). Operate the
„touch-wipe function“ again as necessary.
– Switch off ignition.
