The automatic headlight range control reacts to changes in the
suspension height (attitude of the vehicle).
The following situations may produce a change in the suspension
height:
♦ Towing a trailer/caravan
♦ Different loads (vehicle unladen, partly laden or fully laden)
Note
The basic headlight setting must always be checked and, on ve‐
hicles with electronic damping control (Audi magnetic ride), the
reference position of the suspension must always be re-adapted
in the following cases:
♦ Following assembly work on vehicle level sender
♦ If lower transverse link has been removed and installed
♦ If bolted connections -2- or -3- have been slackened
The vehicle level sender is on ly available as a replacement part
complete with coupling rod an d upper and lower retaining plates.

ride), re-adapt reference position ⇒ Vehicle diagnostic, testing
and information system VAS 5051.
