Audi TT 2007 ➤
5-cylinder direct petrol injection engine (2.5 ltr. 4-valve turbo), mechanics - Edition 12.2010
All vehicles (continued):
– Fill reservoir of -VAS 6096- with 10 litres of premixed coolant
(according to recommended ratio ⇒ page 166 ).
– Fit adapter for cooling system tester -V.A.G 1274/8- onto cool‐
ant expansion tank.
– Attach cooling system charge unit -VAS 6096- to adapter -
V.A.G 1274/8- .
– Run vent hose -1- into a small container -2-.
Note
The vented air draws along a small amount of coolant, which
should be collected.
– Close both valves -A- and -B- (turn lever at right angles to di‐
rection of flow).
– Connect hose -3- to compressed air.
• Pressure: 6 ... 10 bar.
– Open valve -B- by setting lever in direction of flow.
• The suction jet pump generates a partial vacuum in the cooling
system; the needle on the gauge should move into the green
zone.
– Also briefly open valve -A- (turn lever in direction of flow) so
that hose on reservoir of -VAS 6096- can fill with coolant.
– Close valve -A- again.
– Leave valve -B- open for another 2 minutes.
• The suction jet pump continues to generate a partial vacuum
in the cooling system; the needle on the gauge should remain
in the green zone.
– Close valve -B-.
• The needle on the gauge should stop in the green zone. The
vacuum level in the cooling system is then sufficient for sub‐
sequent filling.
Note
♦ If the needle does not reach the green zone, repeat the proc‐
ess.
♦ Check cooling system for leaks if the vacuum is not main‐
tained.
– Detach compressed air hose.
– Open valve -A-.
• The vacuum in the cooling system causes the coolant to be
drawn out of the reservoir of -VAS 6096- ; the cooling system
is then filled.
– Detach cooling system charge unit -VAS 6096- from coolant
expansion tank.
