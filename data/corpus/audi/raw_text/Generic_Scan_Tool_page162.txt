verter Heater, Checking
Note
♦ Vehicle must be raised before electrical harness connector for
the Oxygen Sensor (O2S) Behind Three Way Catalytic Con‐
verter (TWC) -G130- is accessible.
♦ When servicing terminals in harness connector of Oxygen
Sensor 02S) 1 (behind Three Way Catalytic Converter (TWC))
Heater -Z29- , use only gold-plated terminals.
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Multimeter.
♦ Wiring diagram.
Test requirements
• The Oxygen Sensor (O2S) Behind Three Way Catalytic Con‐
verter (TWC) -G130- fuse SB6 in Fuse box B is OK.
• Battery voltage at least 12.5 volts.
• All electrical consumers such as, lights and rear window de‐
froster, switched off.
• Vehicles with automatic transmission, shift selector lever into
position “P” or “N”.
• A/C switched off.
• Ground connections between engine/transmission/chassis
OK.
• Ignition switched OFF.
Test procedure
– Perform a preliminary check to verify the customers complaint.
Refer to ⇒ “3.1 Preliminary Check”, page 8
Start diagnosis
– Remove the right vehicle floor cover.
Checking internal resistance
– Disconnect the Oxygen Sensor (O2S) Behind Three Way Cat‐
alytic Converter (TWC) -G130- electrical harness connector.
– Using a multimeter, check the Oxygen Sensor 02S) 1 (behind
Three Way Catalytic Converter (TWC)) Heater -Z29- electrical
harness connector terminals 1 to 2 for resistance.
Specified value: 2.5 to 14.0 Ω (at approx. 20° C)
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Replace the Oxygen Sensor (O2S) Behind Three Way Cata‐
lytic Converter (TWC) - G130-
If the specified value was obtained:
Checking voltage supply
– Turn the ignition switch ON
– Using a multimeter, check the Oxygen Sensor 02S) 1 (behind
Three Way Catalytic Converter (TWC)) Heater -Z29- electrical
harness connector terminal 1 to engine ground.
