Audi TT 2007 ➤
TDI injection and glow plug system (4-cyl. 2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail) - Edition 03.2010
The fuel pressure regulating valve -N276- -2- is located in the fuel
rail. It maintains a constant pressure in the fuel rail and the injector
pipes (high-pressure fuel circuit).
If the pressure in the high-pressure fuel circuit is too high, the
regulating valve opens to allow some of the fuel to flow back from
the fuel rail to the fuel tank via a return line.
If the pressure in the high-pressure fuel circuit is too low, the fuel
pressure regulating valve -N276- closes and seals off the high-
pressure section of the system from the low-pressure section.
Note
The fuel pressure regulating valve -N276- cannot be re-used.
