Master function for terminal 15 across the powertrain CAN-bus
As in the Audi A3´04, information transmitted across the powertrain CAN bus includes a run-on function.
This allows the various control units to transmit information relevant to safety even when the ignition is off.
With regard to terminal 15 run-on, there are three different groups of powertrain CAN bus control units:
Active and passive control units as well as control units without run-on.
Active control units are control units which are able to keep the powertrain CAN bus awake.
Passive control units remain awake until the gateway signa l s it is ready to enter Sleep mode, but cannot
independently keep the powertrain CAN bus awake.
Control units without run-on function shut off immediately after "ignition off".

Coding the gateway
Difference to the Audi A3´04
When coding the gateway, the derivative (body
version) "Coupé, sports car" must be selected for the
Audi TT Coupé´07.
Reference
For information on coding the
gateway, refer to Self-Study
Programme 312.
