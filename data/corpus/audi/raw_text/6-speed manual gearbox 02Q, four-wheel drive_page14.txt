Oil seals, seals, O-rings and gaskets
♦ Always renew oil seals, O-rings and gaskets.
♦ After removing gaskets and seals, always inspect the contact
surface on the housing or shaft for burrs resulting from removal
or for other signs of damage.
♦ Before installing oil seals, lightly oil the outer circumference of
the seal and fill the space between the sealing lips -arrow-
about half full with grease -G 052 128 A1- .
♦ The open side of the oil seal should face the side containing
the fluid.
♦ When installing a new oil seal, position the seal in the housing
so that the sealing lip does not contact the shaft in the same
place as the old seal (make use of installation depth toleran‐
ces).
♦ Lightly lubricate O-rings with oil before installation to prevent
them being trapped during assembly.
♦ After installing new gaskets, O-rings and oil seals, check oil
level in manual gearbox ⇒ page 138 and bevel box
⇒ page 150 .
Sealants

fore applying sealing paste.

thick.

♦ Renew circlips which have been damaged or over-tensioned.
♦ Circlips must be properly seated in the base of the groove.
♦ Renew spring pins. Position: the slit -A- should be in line with
the line of force -arrow-.
