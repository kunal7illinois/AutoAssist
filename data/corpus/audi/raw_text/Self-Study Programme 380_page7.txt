Technological concept
Sheet-steel parts are used for the first time in the ASF of the Audi TT Coupé ‘07, in addition to aluminium
castings, aluminium extruded sections and aluminium sheet-metal parts. Collectively they form the body
structure. Vehicle weight distribution is optimised by using sheet-steel parts at the rear end of the body.
This has a direct bearing on sporting characteristics such as driving dynamics and acceleration, as well as
safety characteristics such as stopping distance and driving stability Despite the partial use of sheet-steel
parts, the total body weight of 277 kg including attachments, such as doors and lids, is approx. 48% less than
that of a comparable full steel body. Although the TTCoupé has grown considerably in size, the overall weight
of the vehicle has been reduced through the use of the aluminium steel bodyshell.
The body structure of the Audi TT Coupé ‘07 has higher strength and 50% higher torsional rigidity than its
predecessor.
