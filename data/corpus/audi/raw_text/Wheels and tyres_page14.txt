Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
If lightly corroded wheel bolts are re-installed on the vehicle, clean
the threads and the shoulders on the bolt heads and grease the
surfaces in sliding contact using Optimol TA paste -G 052 109 A2-
as follows (all vehicles except RS 2 and RS 4, Type 8D):
A - One-piece wheel bolt. Lightly grease thread -2- and shoulder
-1-.
B - Two-piece wheel bolt. Lightly grease thread -3-, and area be‐
tween bolt head contact surface -6- and back of convex washer
-5-. Do not apply grease to the convex surface -4- that bears
against the wheel rim.
Note
Use only Optimol TA paste -G 052 109 A2- . The paste must not
come into contact with parts of the brake system.
Only for RS 2 and RS 4 (Type 8D):
• Slightly corroded wheel bolts are not to be cleaned and
greased. They must always be renewed.
• Wheel bolts are always to be screwed in without grease.
Allvehicles (continued):
– Check that wheel bolts can be screwed in easily by hand with‐
out using tools. When fitting the wheel, the bolts should screw
in easily over the full length of the threads.
– Make sure the holes in the hub align. The thread of the wheel
bolts must not contact the bore in the brake disc.
– If the thread of the wheel bolt touches the hole, turn the brake
disc relative to the wheel hub accordingly.
Fitting wheels:
♦ Position wheel on wheel hub and secure by hand with two op‐
posing wheel bolts.
♦ Screw in remaining wheel bolts by hand. They should screw
in easily. Make sure the bores are exactly centralised.
♦ If necessary lift the wheel slightly and tighten two wheel bolts
lightly by hand.
♦ When fitting the wheel, screw in all wheel bolts uniformly by
hand.
♦ Tighten the wheel bolts diagonally using, for example, a four-
arm wheel nut wrench, to about 30 Nm.
WARNING
Do not use an impact wrench to screw in the wheel bolts.
