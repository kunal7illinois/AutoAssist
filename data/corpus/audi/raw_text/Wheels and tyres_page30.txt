2.4 Tyre pressure (maintenance)
The weight of the vehicle causes the tyre contact area to flatten.
This in turn causes the running surface and the entire ply of the
tyre to be continually deformed when a tyre is rolling. If the tyre is
underinflated, the amount of flex is higher, resulting in a greater
increase in heat and increased rolling resistance. This then leads
to increased wear and poses a greater safety risk.
Example: Specified standard tyre pressure with cold tyres, ac‐
cording to vehicle load
Tyre pressure (bar) Tyre pressure (%) Tyre life (%)
2.3 100 100
1.9 80 85
1.4 60 60
1.0 40 25
If tyre pressure is too high, this will result in poor rolling comfort
and increased wear across the centre of the tread. We recom‐
mend to always observe the tyre pressures specified by the
manufacturer.
