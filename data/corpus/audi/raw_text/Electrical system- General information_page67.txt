1 Safety precautions when handling
gas discharge bulbs
Never renew bulbs if you are not familiar with the necessary pro‐
cedure, safety precautions and tools required.
WARNING
High voltage! Danger to life!
♦ Always disconnect the battery earth cable before working
on parts of the gas discharge headlights marked with yel‐
low high-voltage warning symbols.
♦ Then switch dipped beam on and off again to dissipate any
remaining voltage.
♦ Switch off ignition and all electrical equipment and remove
ignition key.
♦ Never operate the gas discharge bulb control unit without
a gas discharge bulb.
♦ The gas discharge bulb may only be operated in the head‐
light housing because of the high voltages (above
28,000 V when the gas discharge bulb is ignited).
WARNING
Risk of injury from burns, UV radiation, dazzling and explosion.
♦ The gas discharge bulb may only be operated in the head‐
light housing because of the high temperatures, the ab‐
sorption of UV radiation and to avoid dazzling.
♦ Never look into the light beam as this could disturb the eye
sight for an extended period of time.
♦ Gas discharge bulbs are pressurised and can burst when
they are renewed.
♦ Always wear safety goggles and gloves when removing
and installing gas discharge bulbs.
WARNING
Observe environmental requirements.
♦ Gas discharge bulbs are hazardous waste. They contain
metallic mercury (Hg) and traces of thallium.
♦ Never break off gas discharge bulbs and do not touch
broken glass part of bulb.
♦ Observe disposal regulations. Gas discharge bulbs
should only be disposed of in the appropriate containers
at an official collection point.
