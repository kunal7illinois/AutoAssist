Heating and Air Conditioning - Edition 04.2009
– Compare the -G263- measured value displayed to the values
in the graph.
A - Air temperature measured by -G263-
B - Ambient temperature
C - Permissible tolerance range
Depending on the ambient temperature, the measured air tem‐
perature must be within the stated tolerance range -C- after 5
minutes.
Note
♦ If the required values are not attained, check the measured
values of the evaporator output temperature sender -G263-
and the measured value of the front left chest vent temperature
sensor -G385- ( front right chest vent temperature sensor -
G386- on right-hand drive vehicles) and compare the meas‐
ured values displayed to one another.
♦ If the measured value for -G263- only differs slightly from the
measured value for -G385- ( -G386- ): Perform "Measures to
be taken if readout does not match specification"
⇒ page 135
♦ If the measured value of the evaporator output temperature
sender -G263- is higher than that of the front left chest vent
temperature sensor -G385- ( front right chest vent temperature
sensor -G386- on right-hand drive vehicles), check for proper
installation of the evaporator output temperature sender -
G263- and perform the electrical checks for this sender ⇒
"Guided fault-finding" function of vehicle diagnostic, testing
and information system VAS 5051 .
♦ Operation of the air conditioner can be seen, for example, from
the fact that the refrigerant pipe on the low-pressure end (thick
pipe) cools down.
If the measured value of the evaporator output temperature send‐
er -G263- (and thus the system cooling output) is OK:
– Set the air outflow direction by way of the rotary air distribution
control on the air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic con‐
trol unit -J255- to “footwell”.
– Compare the measured value displayed for -G263- to the
measured values of the left footwell vent temperature sender
-G261- and the right footwell vent temperature sender -G262- .
After 5 minutes, the measured values for -G261- and -G262- must
not be more than 3 °C higher than that for -G263- .
