9.2.3 Air routing in air distributor housing
Note
♦ To illustrate air routing in the air distributor housing, it is shown
in the form of sectional views “A” -“A” and “B”-“B”.
♦ On the Audi TT with air conditioner, the two control motors for
the left and right temperature flaps are regulated via a char‐
acteristic curve depending on the end stops learnt (only one
temperature setting can be made at the air conditioner oper‐
ating unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- ).
♦ Depending on the measured temperatures, the sunlight pen‐
etration detected and the setting of the air conditioner operat‐
ing unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- , the specified outlet
temperature calculated and thus the position of the tempera‐
ture flaps for the left and right side may differ.
♦ The Audi TT with no air conditioner (heater only) is only fitted
with one temperature flap control motor. T h e two temperature
flaps for the left and right side are linked b y way of the shaft
and thus moved jointly by the left temperature flap control mo‐
tor -V158- .
♦ As vehicles with no air conditioner (heater only) are not fitted
with any temperature sensors, there is no regulation of the
outlet temperature. The left temperature flap control motor -
V158- is set by the heater operating unit, Climatronic control
unit -J255- to a position calculated on the basis of the tem‐
perature setting and the learnt control motor stop values.
