Note
♦ While heating up the new spur gear, monitor the temperature
with the temperature gauge -VAS 6519- .
♦ When the temperature reaches 200 °C, you have approx. 4
seconds to fit the spur gear on the crankshaft.
♦ A higher temperature increases the amount of time available
(220 °C = approx. 6 seconds).
♦ Make sure the end of the crankshaft is clean.
Caution
Do not exceed a maximum temperature of 240 °C; otherwise
the spur gear can become discoloured and distorted.
