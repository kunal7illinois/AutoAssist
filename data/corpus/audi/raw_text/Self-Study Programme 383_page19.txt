To ensure consistent laser welding of aluminium parts, the parts to be welded must have a perfectly clean sur-
face. This is achieved either by washing the component parts followed by chemical pickling or by using the
new Laser Clean process.
A controlled laser beam removes all residues from the surface by heating it for a short time. Parts cleaned
using this method can be directly laser-welded.
