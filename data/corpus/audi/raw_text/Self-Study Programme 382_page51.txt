The Apple iPod and the associated PC software
(iTunes) have a function for programming playlists.
A playlist can have a freely selectable name and
contain any number of songs in a fixed sequence.
This feature has been utilised.
The iPod adaptor loads the first 5 playlists in
alphabetical order. The corresponding CD number is
assigned to each playlist. The first alphabetical
playlist appears on the radio as CD 1, the second
playlist as CD 2, and so on. All tracks are loaded in
alphabetical order of artist as CD 6.

To program special playlists for use of the iPod in the car, it is recommended to place a number in front of the
playlist name.
When playlists are sorted in alphabetical order, a number always takes precedence over the letter "A".
The playlists "1_Mozart", "2_Beethoven", "3_ Chopin", etc. are loaded by the adaptor based on the preceding
number in the order CD1 = 1_Mozart, CD2 = 2_Beethoven, CD3 = 3_ Chopin.
The songs are displayed as Track 01, Track 02, etc.
like on the CD changer. The numbering on the radio
display goes up to Track 99. All tracks in a playlist
can be played. If more than 99 tracks are stored in a
playlist, only the last two digits of the track number
are displayed for tracks 100 and upwards. Track 00 is
displayed for track 200 and Track 37 for track 1037.
When the radio is on, the rechargeable battery of
the iPod is charged using the iPod adaptor.
To disconnect the iPod from the adaptor, switch the
radio off.
