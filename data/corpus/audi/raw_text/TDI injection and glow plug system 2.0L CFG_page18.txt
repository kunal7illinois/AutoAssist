4 Bleeding fuel system
Caution
If components of the fuel system between the fuel tank and the
high-pressure fuel pump are removed or renewed, the basic
setting “Checking fuel system pressurisation pump” must be
performed to bleed the fuel system.
If the supplementary fuel pump, fuel line (between fuel tank
and high-pressure fuel pump) or fuel filter is removed or re‐
newed, the basic setting “Checking fuel system pressurisation
pump” must be performed before the engine is started for the
first time.
Proceed as follows to fill fuel system with fuel:
– Connect a vehicle diagnostic tester.
– Switch on ignition.
– Select “Engine electronics” in vehicle self-diagnosis.
– Then select “Basic setting”.
– Select “Checking fuel system pressurisation pump” from the
list.
– Press “Start” button.
– The fuel pumps start running.
– The fuel pumps must run for approx. 1 minute to ensure that
the fuel system is filled sufficiently with fuel.
Note
To repeat basic setting, switch ignition off and on once. Then start
basic setting again.
– Start engine after filling fuel system.
– Run engine at moderate speed for several minutes and then
switch off.
– Check fuel system for leaks.
– Erase entry in event memory using diagnostic tester.
– After completing the repair, road-test the vehicle over a dis‐
tance of at least 20 km. Accelerate with full throttle at least
once. Then inspect the high-pressure section of the fuel sys‐
tem again for leaks.
Note
If there is any air left in the fuel system, the engine may switch to
the backup mode ('emergency running' mode) during the road
test. Switch off the engine and erase the event memory. Then
continue the road test.
– Interrogate event memory.
