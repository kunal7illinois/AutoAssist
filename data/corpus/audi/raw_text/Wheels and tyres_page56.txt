– Note the smallest and the largest dial readings.
S - Lateral run-out
H - Radial run-out
– Compare the measured values with the specifications in the
table.
Note
You can disregard extreme readings on the dial gauge which are
due to small irregularities.

If the measured value exceeds the specification, acceptable
smoothness cannot be attained.
6.10 Matching
When radial or lateral run-out of the wheel and tyre coincide, the
out-of-true running of the wheel is amplified by the tyre.
For technical reasons, 100% true running is not possible when
there is radial and lateral run-out on the wheel and tyre.
Under unfavourable circumstances, the radial or lateral run-out of
the entire wheel with tyre may be greater than permitted.
The individual values of the wheel and the tyre may nevertheless
each be within the permitted tolerances.
Turning the tyre strategically with respect to the wheel can parti‐
ally compensate for radial or lateral run-out.
This procedure, known as "matching", can be used to optimise
the true-running properties of the wheel and tyre assembly.
Before matching the used wheels which are fitted on the vehicle
the tyres must be run warm. This will eliminate any flat spots
caused by storage or handling ⇒ page 43 .
Procedure for matching:
– Deflate the tyre.
– Press the tyre beads off the rim flanges.
– Coat the tyre bead all round with tyre fitting lubricant.
– Rotate the tyre 180° with respect to the wheel.
– Inflate the tyre to approx. 4 bar.
– Mount the wheel with tyre on the wheel balancer.
– Check true running/radial and lateral run-out.
