Note
♦ The design of the receiver differs on these vehicles depending
on the condenser manufacturer ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr.

the version of the condenser. The integrated receiver contains
a dryer cartridge which is currently not always available as a
replacement part. On vehicles fitted with this condenser, it may
therefore be necessary to replace the entire condenser after
rectifying any problems ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ In the case of condensers with an integrated receiver / dryer
cartridge which cannot be renewed separately or which are
not available separately, the condenser is to be replaced after
flushing (together with the built-in dryer cartridge) ⇒ Heating,
