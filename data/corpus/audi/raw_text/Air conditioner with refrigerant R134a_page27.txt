Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.2.9 Quick-release couplings on refrigerant
line
WARNING
Only release and open the quick-release couplings after com‐
pletely discharging the refrigerant circuit.
Note
♦ This illustration shows the quick-release couplings with a re‐
frigerant pipe with an internal heat exchanger as fitted for
example on the Audi A4 2008 > and the Audi A5 Coupé 2008
> ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop
manual).
♦ Removal of the refrigerant line -D- involves opening the re‐
taining ring -A- with the air conditioner line release tool -
T40149/- for example ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-
specific workshop manual).
♦ Following removal of the applicable refrigerant pipe, the quick-
release couplings -B- and -G- are to be replaced together with
the corresponding support ring -E- or -H- and the correspond‐
ing O-ring -F- or -J- ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-
specific workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
A - Retaining ring (in quick-release coupling, high-pressure side)
B - Quick-release coupling with retaining ring ( „high-pressure
side“)
C - Refrigerant pipe with an internal hea t exchanger
D - Refrigerant line ( „high-pressure side“)
E - Support ring ( „high-pressure side“)
F - O-ring ( „high-pressure side“)
G - Quick-release coupling with retaining ring ( „low-pressure
side“)
