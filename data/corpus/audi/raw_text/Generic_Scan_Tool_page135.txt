TT RS 2012 ➤
Generic Scan Tool - Edition 07.2011
Note
♦ The Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor -G42- is part of the
Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor -G71- and cannot
be replaced separately
♦ Use only gold-plated terminals when servicing terminals in
harness connector of Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sen‐
sor -G71- / Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor -G42- .
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ multimeter.
♦ Wiring diagram.
Test requirements
• The Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- fuse OK.
• Battery voltage at least 12.5 volts.
• All electrical consumers such as, lights and rear window de‐
froster, switched off.
• Vehicles with automatic transmission, shift selector lever into
position “P” or “N”.
• A/C switched off.
• Ground (GND) connections between engine/transmission/
chassis OK.
• Coolant Temperature at least 80° C.
• Ignition switched off.
Test procedure
– Perform a preliminary check to verify the customers complaint.
Refer to ⇒ “3.1 Preliminary Check”, page 8 .
Start diagnosis
– Connect the scan tool.
– Start engine and let it run at idle.
– Using the scan tool, Check the temperature of the Manifold
Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor -G71- and Intake Air Tem‐
perature (IAT) Sensor -G42- at idle:
Diagnostic text Specified value
Intake air temperature sensor
• Engine running at idle approx. ambient temper‐
ature
– End diagnosis and switch ignition off.
If the specified value was obtained, but the DTC memory has a
DTC indicating a Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor -
G71- / Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor -G42- fault:
– Check the voltage supply of the Manifold Absolute Pressure
(MAP) Sensor -G71- / Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor -
G42- ⇒ page 132 .
If specified value was not obtained:
– Check the wiring of the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP)
Sensor -G71- / Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor -G42-
