symphony radio
The symphony radio has all the features of the concert radio.
The symphony radio is additionally equipped with an internal MP3 compatible 6-disc CD changer.
In addition, the radio has the ability to record Traffic information Messages (TIM key = Traffic Information
Message). Traffic Information Messages stored by the radio can be played back by briefly pressing the TIM
key. Holding the TIM key down activates a function which allows two time periods to be programmed during
which Traffic Information Messages are recorded by the radio even when it is switched off.
Note
The radio has a higher power consumption in TIM record standby mode than when completely
switched off. Please deactivate the TIM function to perform static current measurements on the
vehicle.
Technical variants
In addition to the Audi TT Coupé ‘07, these radios will in future also be used in other Audi models equipped
with the infotainment CAN bus. The necessary adjustments are basically the type of front trim panel and the
diagnosis path (CAN, L-wire, etc.)
