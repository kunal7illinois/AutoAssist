3.3 Valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) or ab‐
sorbent glass mat (AGM) battery without
„magic eye“
♦ VLRA or AGM batteries are deep-cycle resistant and leak-
proof.
♦ VRLA or AGM batteries are filled with electrolyte which is held
in place in an „A“bsorbent „G“lass „M“at. The battery is sealed
and equipped with valves.
♦ As the electrolyte is absorbed in the mat, these batteries can‐
not have a „magic eye“. Absorbent glass mat batteries are
marked with „AGM“ on the battery.
Note
♦ VLRA or AGM batteries cannot and must not be opened and
must not be topped up with distilled water.
♦ Only perform visual inspections.
Caution
Fitting a wrong battery will result in poor crash safety.
♦ If a vehicle was originally equipped with a VRLA or AGM
battery, only replace the battery with another VRLA or
AGM battery.
