♦ Replacement restrictors with different holes are available (yel‐
low-coloured 1.54 mm, red-coloured 1.42 mm).

may tend more towards orange.

red-coloured restrictors may be fitted.
9.2 Approved refrigerant oils and refrigerant
oil capacities
Note
♦ As PAG (polyalkylene glycol) oil is highly hygroscopic (attracts
water), opened containers are to be immediately re-sealed so
as to be air-tight.
♦ PAG oil from containers which have been open for a lengthy
period is no longer usable.
