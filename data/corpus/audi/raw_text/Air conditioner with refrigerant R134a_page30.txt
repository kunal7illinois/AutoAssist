Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.4 Connections for quick-release coupling
in refrigerant circuit
• Only valves and connections resistant to R134a refrigerant
and the related refrigerant oils are to be used.
• There are different connections (outer diameter) for high and
low-pressure sides.
• Discharge refrigerant circuit before removing valves or valve
cores.
• Always screw on sealing caps.

2.4.1 Connections with Schrader valve (nee‐
dle valve)
♦ -A- Service connection (soldered in)
♦ -B- Valve core (designation: Schrader valve or needle valve)
♦ -C- O-ring (for valve)
♦ -D- Sealing cap with seal
Note
♦ Following connection, carefully screw the handwheel of the
service coupling into the quick-release coupling adapter to the
extent required to reliably open the valve in the service con‐
nection (observe the pressure gauge; take care not to open
the valve too far).
♦ To remove and install the valve core -B- with the refrigerant
circuit drained, make use of an adapter from the socket -
T10364- for example.
♦ Take care when tightening valve core -B- (low torque).
♦ There are different versions of these valves and the tightening
torques therefore also differ. The tightening torque for a valve
insert -B- with a VG5 thread (5.2 x 0.7 mm, tyre valve) is
0.4 Nm +- 0.1 Nm. For a valve insert with an M6 x 0.75 mm
thread, the tightening torque is 0.9 Nm +- 0.1 Nm and for a
valve insert with an M8 x 1.0 mm thread it is 2.0 Nm +- 0.2 Nm.
♦ There are different versions of these valves, the valve cores
and the corresponding sealing caps. Attention is to be paid to
the correct version of the valve core and correct assignment
of the sealing caps ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
