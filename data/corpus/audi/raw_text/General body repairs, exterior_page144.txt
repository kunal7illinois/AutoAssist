2 Repairing hydraulic system for con‐
vertible roof
2.1 General information on hydraulic sys‐
tem
♦ The hydraulic system is self-bleeding and maintenance-free.
♦ After all repairs in which hydraulic connections are opened or
parts of the hydraulic system are renewed, check the fluid level
and top up to the marks on the reservoir if required
⇒ page 143 .
2.2 Rules for cleanliness
Caution
Hydraulic fluid damages the paintwork. For this reason, imme‐
diately remove any hydraulic fluid which may drip onto painted
surfaces.
♦ Thoroughly clean connection points and the surrounding
areas before opening the connection.
♦ Place removed components on a clean surface and cover
them. Use foil or paper. Use only lint-free cloths!
♦ Carefully cover / seal opened components if repairs are not
performed immediately.
♦ Only install clean components; replacement parts must not be
removed from their packaging until just before installation.
♦ Place containers, plastic foil or cloths under connections to be
opened, so that no hydraulic fluid comes into contact with
painted surfaces.
♦ Seal open hydraulic lines with plugs to stop hydraulic fluid
running out.
2.3 Filling and bleeding the hydraulic sys‐
tem
Note
♦ The electro-hydraulic convertible roof is actuated by a sealed
hydraulic system. The system will normally only need filling if
there has been a loss of fluid (accident, leak etc.).
♦ Due to the stroke and displacement effect of the pistons in the
hydraulic cylinders, the convertible roof must be in the storage
compartment (retracted position) when the hydraulic system
is filled.
♦ After filling the system, operate the convertible roof several
times.
♦ Then check the fluid level once again and top up if necessary.
