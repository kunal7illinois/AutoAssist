pressor/low-pressure end
The pressures on the low-pressure end are maintained at approx.
2 bar absolute (corresponding to approx. 1 bar gauge) by the
„regulating“ air conditioner compressor even at varying engine
speeds. This however only applies within the output range of the
air conditioner compressor. If the output limits of the air condi‐
tioner compressor are exceeded, refer to ⇒ page 103 .
Note
On vehicles with air conditioner compressor regulating valve -
N280- the pressure on the low pressure end is altered by actuat‐
ing the valve.
Arrows show direction of refrigerant flow.
