3 Calculating ratio “i”
Example:
6th gear Final drive
Drive gear ZG1 = 40 ZA1 = 23
Driven gear ZG2 = 39 ZA2 = 71
i = ZG2 : ZG1 1)
iG = gear ratio = ZG2 : ZG1 = 39 : 40 = 0.975
iA = axle ratio = ZA2 : ZA1 = 71 : 23 = 3.087
iov = overall ratio = iG x iA = 0.975 x 3.087 = 3.010
1) Z1 = No. of teeth on drive gear, Z2 = No. of teeth on driven gear
