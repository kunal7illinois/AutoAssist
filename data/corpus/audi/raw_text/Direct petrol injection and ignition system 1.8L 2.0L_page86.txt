erly secured.
Injuries can also be caused if the passenger's airbag is trig‐
gered in a collision.
• The use of test equipment while driving causes distraction.
• There is an increased risk of injury if test equipment is not
secured.
♦ Move the passenger's seat back as far as it will go.
♦ Use only vehicle diagnosis and service information sys‐
tem -VAS 5052 A- or diagnosis system -VAS 5053- .

thighs (as shown in illustration) and must be operated by
the passenger.

♦ Do not touch or disconnect ignition wiring when the engine is
running or being turned at starter speed.
♦ The ignition must be switched off before disconnecting or con‐

nectors from the ignition coils and the injectors. After
completing the work, interrogate and erase the event memory.
