3.8 Machining valve seats
If a good seating pattern cannot be obtained by grinding the valve
seats (lapping), they must be refaced (machined).
Note
♦ When servicing engines with leaking valves, it is not sufficient
to machine (reface) the valve seats and renew the valves. The
valve guides must also be checked for wear. This is particu‐
larly important on high-mileage engines ⇒ page 126 .
♦ Valve seats should only be machined to the extent required to
give a proper seating pattern.
♦ Calculate the maximum permissible machining dimension be‐
fore machining valve seats.
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Depth gauge
♦ Valve seat machining tool
Calculating maximum permissible machining dimension
Note
If the valve has to be renewed as part of a repair, use a new valve
for the measurement.
– Insert valve and press firmly against valve seat.
