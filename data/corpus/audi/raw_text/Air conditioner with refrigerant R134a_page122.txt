Possible deviation from specifica‐ Possible causes of fault Fault elimination
tion
• High and low pressure normal
• Air conditioner compressor
noise (particularly after switch-
on)
• Required cooling output is at‐
tained
Note
♦ Overfilling with refrigerant oil may occur if, for example, the air
conditioner compressor has been replaced without adjusting
the quantity of refrigerant oil.
♦ If there is too much refrigerant oil in the circuit, drain the air
conditioner compressor and replace the receiver. After clean‐
ing the refrigerant circuit (flush with refrigerant R134a
⇒ page 59 or blow out with compressed air and nitrogen
⇒ page 55 ), add the correct amount of refrigerant oil to the
circuit ⇒ page 164 .

strictor, reservoir and air conditioner
compressor regulating valve -N280-
(with externally regulated air conditioner
compressor)
Note
♦ Connecting air conditioner service station ⇒ page 99
♦ Heed the test conditions ⇒ page 103 .
– Check the pressures in the refrigerant circuit (with the air con‐
ditioner service station) with the ignition switched off
⇒ page 103 .
The pressures with the ignition switched off correspond to the
specifications.
– Start the engine.
– Set the engine speed to 2000 rpm.
– Observe the pressure reading (e.g. pressure gauge) of the air
conditioner service station.
Note
♦ The switching pressures for actuation of -N280- and the radi‐
ator fans -V7- are vehicle-specific.
♦ The pressures must be measured at the service connections;
the fitting locations of these connections are vehicle-specific
