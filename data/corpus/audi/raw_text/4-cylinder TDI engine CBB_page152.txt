1.6 Installing a new balance shaft assembly
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Bits -T10099-
♦ Locking tool -T10255-
♦ Special tool -T10393-
Procedure
• Tightening torques ⇒ page 136
• Crankshaft locked in position with crankshaft stop -T10050- .
Note
♦ The spur gear drive of the balance shaft assembly must be
installed with a backlash of 0.038 ... 0.072 mm.
♦ To achieve the correct backlash, a suitably thick coating is al‐
ready applied to the new idler gear.
♦ The coating is worn down rapidly and the backlash is then
correct.
♦ On idler gears with coating applied to teeth on parts of cir‐
cumference only, a white dot indicates correct installation
position.
♦ If there is no white dot, the complete circumference of the idler
gear is coated.
♦ A new balance shaft assembly must always be installed in
conjunction with a new idler gear which has the correct coat‐
ing.
♦ Renew bolts securing balance shaft assembly.
