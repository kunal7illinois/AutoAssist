11.3.1 Preparation
– Warm undercoating/sealing materials only with hot air device
(max. 420°C) or remove with rotating wire brush.
– Remove paint and priming material with paint remover (LLE
812 000 A2) or rotating plastic brush.
11.3.2 Separating procedure
– Do not use thermodynamic separating procedures (cutting
torch) if possible (only for rough cuts).
– In order to not cause any damage to the galvanized coating in
the area of separation, mechanical separation procedures are
preferred, e.g. spot weld drill, body repair saw.
11.3.3 Joining techniques
The resistance spot welding procedure only causes slight erosion
in the galvanized layer in the area of the weld. The protective
galvanized ring formed at the same time around the weld point
protects against corrosion.
Always use resistance spot welding whenever possible.
When using resistance spot welding, always observe galvanized
coatings of different thickness (perform a test weld).
Use gas-shielded welding as a substitute for resistance spot
welding only if necessary.
Welding primer (galvanized spray D 007 500 04) must be applied
between the fastening flanges.
Apply filler (ALN 787 200 10) to all connecting points.
11.4 Welding Work on Galvanized Body Pan‐
els
WARNING
Because toxic galvanized oxide develops in welding emissions
when welding galvanized sheet steel panels, there must be
good workplace ventilation and exhaust-gas removal through
appropriate exhaust system, e.g. -V.A.G 1586- .
