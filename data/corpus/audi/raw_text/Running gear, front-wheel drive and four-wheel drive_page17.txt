Audi TT 2007 ➤
Running gear, front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive - Edition 08.2010
1.4 Lifting suspension to unladen position
Special tools and workshop
equipment required
♦ Engine and gearbox jack -
V.A.G 1383 A-
♦ Tensioning strap -T10038-
♦ Support -T10149-
Note
All bolts on running gear components with bonded rubber bushes
must always be tightened with the suspension in the unladen po‐
sition (vehicle unladen).
Bonded rubber bushes can only be turned to a limited extent.
Therefore, before tightening the bolts, suspension components
with bonded rubber bushes must be brought into a position cor‐
responding to the normal position of the unladen vehicle while
driving (unladen position).
Otherwise, the bush would be subject to torsion loading and its
service life would be shortened.
This position can be simulated on the lifting platform by raising
the appropriate part of the suspension with the engine and gear‐
box jack -V.A.G 1383 A- and support -T10149- .
