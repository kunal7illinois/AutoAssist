– Using a multimeter, check the Turbocharger Recirculating
Valve -N249- electrical harness connector terminal 2 to En‐
gine Control Module (ECM) -J623- electrical harness connec‐
tor T60 terminal 31 for an open circuit.

Specified value: 1.5 Ω max.
If the specification is not obtained:
– Check the wiring for a short circuit to each other, Battery (+),
and Ground (GND).
– Check the electrical harness connector for damage, corrosion,
loose or broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is detected in the wiring and if the voltage supply
was OK:
– Replace the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- . Refer to
the appropriate service manual.
– Install the engine cover with air filter. Refer to the appropriate
service manual.
Final procedures
After the repair work, the following work steps must be performed
in the following sequence:
1 - Check the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Memory”,
page 14 .
2 - If necessary, erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
3 - If the DTC memory was erased, generate readiness code.
Refer to ⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .

Temperature Sensor 2, Checking
Observe all safety precautions:
⇒ “1.1 Safety Precautions”, page 2
View clean working conditions:
⇒ “1.2 Clean Working Conditions”, page 3
Use only gold-plated terminals when servicing any component
with gold-plated electrical harness connector terminals.
Note
Th e Charge Air Pressure Sensor -G31- / Intake Air Temperature
(IA T ) Sensor 2 -G299- shares the same housing. Replacing either
component replaces the other at the same time.
For wiring diagrams, component locations, and connector views,
Refer to the applicable wiring diagram.
