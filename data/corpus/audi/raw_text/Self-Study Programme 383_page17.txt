New joining technique: Flow Drill screwing
Automatic direct screwing enables joints to be made between any materials, even if these materials can be
accessed from one side only. A special coated screw is driven under high surface pressure through a hole in
the outer part to be joined. The lower part is not predrilled. The pressure and rotational speed soften the
material and allow the screw to be inserted.

Information on the repair concept
Flow Drill screws can be removed in the service workshop and replaced with new screws. In case of thread
damage, screws are also available in oversize (M6 instead of M5) . For use in new parts, it may be necessary to
predrill the material.
