Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Applying leak detection additive to the refrigerant circuit by way
of an open connection
– Open the refrigerant circuit at a readily accessible connection.
– Cover the surrounding area with sheeting or absorbent paper.
– Hold filler tube upwards.
– Screw in the toggle of the hand pump until the leak detection
additive emerges from the tube.
– Fill the refrigerant circuit with 2.5 +/- 0.5 ml (millilitre = cm3) of
leak detection additive.
Note
Heed the following if leak detection fluid has already been poured
into a refrigerant circuit in the course of previous repair work: Only
pour in fresh leak detection fluid if the refrigerant oil is replaced.
If only a certain amount of refrigerant oil has been replaced, just
add the corresponding quantity of leak detection fluid. After re‐
placing 100 ml of refrigerant oil on a vehicle containing 250 ml for
example, just add 1 ml (cm3 ) of leak detection additive.
– Renew O-ring at open connection.
– Assemble refrigerant circuit.
– Affix a sticker next to the service connections to indicate that
leak detection fluid has been added to this refrigerant circuit.
– Evacuate and charge the refrigerant circuit as specified
⇒ page 49 and ⇒ page 53 .
– Start up the air conditioner.
Note
♦ The air conditioner must be operated for at least 60 min. to
distribute the additive throughout the refrigerant circuit (the air
conditioner compressor must run). Depending on the extent of
the leak, the leakage location may already become visible un‐
der UV light within this period.
♦ Depending on its magnitude and location, it may now take
several days for sufficient refrigerant oil with additive to
emerge to clearly localise the leakage point.
– Use a UV lamp VAS 6196/4 to locate the refrigerant circuit leak
