Occupant protection
Airbag
The Audi TT Coupé ‘07 has two-stage front airbags on the driver and front passenger sides.
The airbag control unit selects the time interval between the two ignition stages (approx. 5 ms to 30 ms)
according to severity and type of crash.
The loads acting on the driver or front passenger during an accident can be reduced through time-staggered
ignition of the propellant charges.
Both propellant charges are always ignited. This ensures that no propellant charge remains active after the
airbag is deployed.

Airbag igniter I, driver side N95
Airbag igniter II, driver side N250
A gas generator with two pyrotechnic propellant charges is integrated in the driver's airbag.
Igniter I is activated electrically by the airbag control unit J234. The igniter flame passes through the container
and ignites the ignition charge in the container. If the pressure produced by the ignition of the ignition charge
is high enough, the flame will break through the container and reach the propellant charge through the
perforated tube. Propellant charge I ignites and combusts. The developing gas destroys the foil seal, and
filtered gas flows through the air outlet into the airbag. After a defined interval has expired, the airbag control
unit activates igniter II, which in turn ignites propellant charge II directly. The gas produced by combustion of
the propellant material flows through the raised end cap into the combustion chamber of propellant charge I.
From here the gas flows through the filter into the airbag.
