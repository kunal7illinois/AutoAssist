2 Servicing central locking system
Note
♦ The central locking system is electrical.
♦ The door actuators are integrated into the door lock and have
two motors.
♦ The actuators cannot be renewed separately.
♦ The first motor locks the door, whereas the second motor locks
the interior door handle (SAFE function = country-specific).
♦ The doors can then also no longer be opened from the inside.
♦ Following an accident involving airbag triggering, the central
lo c king system control unit releases any locked doors.
♦ Central locking system control unit is located in rear right side
panel.
