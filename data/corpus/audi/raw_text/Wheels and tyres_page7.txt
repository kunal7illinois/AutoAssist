1.1 General information on wheels and
tyres
The factory recommends using tyres of the same make, design
and tread pattern on all wheels.
Always renew the rubber valve when fitting a new wheel rim or
tyre.
Tyres are to be fitted with DOT mark facing outer side of wheel.
For tyres with directional tread pattern, this only applies to left side
of vehicle.
If the vehicle is fitted with tyres with a directional tread pattern,
the spare wheel should have a wheel/tyre combination for the
right-hand side of the vehicle.
