12 Tyres with run-flat capability (PAX)
Work on PAX wheels must only be performed by trained work‐
shops.
These workshops have suitably trained personnel and the nec‐
essary special tools.
12.1 Construction of tyres with run-flat capa‐
bility (PAX)
Run-flat tyres (PAX) are specially developed tyres that differ from
conventional tyres as follows:
PAX tyre with support ring
– -I- PAX tyre with air
– -II- PAX tyre without air
– The tyre is anchored on a special rim which prevents the tyre
from sliding off when air is lost. The support ring is made of
rubber and maintains stability in the event of a pressure drop.
♦ The inner and outer bead diameters differ in size. This makes
it possible to add a support ring inside the tyre.
♦ The tyre is secured differently to the rim.
♦ This allows the tyre height to be greatly reduced. This was
made possible by the reduced bead area due the special con‐
nection between the tyre and rim.
♦ The tyre beads are formed such that they engage in the rim
seat. Therefore, the tyre remains firmly secured to the wheel/
rim even when there has been a loss of inflation pressure.
