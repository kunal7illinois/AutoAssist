4.3 Saw-tooth wear
Saw-tooth wear is a stepped wear pattern on the individual tread
blocks – see illustration – that can cause increased tyre noise.
The saw tooth pattern ("heel-and-toe" wear) is caused by uneven
deformation of the tread blocks in the tyre contact area . Saw-tooth
wear is more pronounced on non-driven wheels than o n driven
wheels.
New tyres are more susceptible to saw-tooth wear because of the
greater elasticity of the high tread blocks. As the tread depth de‐
creases, the tread blocks become more rigid and the tendency to
wear in a saw-tooth pattern decreases.
What does a saw tooth wear pattern look like?
Viewed in the direction of travel, the tread blocks are higher at the
front than they are at the rear, see illustration. Pronounced saw-
tooth wear can lead to customers complaining about tyre noise.
Pronounced saw-tooth wear occurs:
