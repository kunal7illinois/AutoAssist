Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ The air conditioner compressors fitted at the start of production
are manufactured by „Denso“ (type „6 SEU 14“) for vehicles
with 4 and 6-cyl. engine and type „7 SEU 17“ for vehicles with
8-cyl. engine); this air conditioner compressor has no mag‐
netic clutch (it is constantly driven by the engine). Different
makes of air conditioner compressor may also be fitted at a
later date depending on the engine ⇒ Electronic parts cata‐
logue and ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific
workshop manual).
♦ This air conditioner compressor is available as a replacement
part with different oil capacities and attention must therefore
be paid to the oil quantity in the air conditioner compressor as
well as to the exact part number ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr.
87 (vehicle-specific workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts
catalogue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
