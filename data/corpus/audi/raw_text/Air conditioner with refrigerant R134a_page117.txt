Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
7.3 Checking pressures on vehicles with an
expansion valve and receiver (with in‐
ternally regulated air conditioner com‐
pressor)
Note
♦ Connecting air conditioner service station ⇒ page 99
♦ Heed the test conditions ⇒ page 103 .
– Check the pressures in the refrigerant circuit (with the air con‐
ditioner service station) with the ignition switched off
⇒ page 103 .
The pressures with the ignition switched off correspond to the
specifications.
– Start the engine.
– Set the engine speed to 2000 rpm.
– Observe the pressure reading (e.g. pressure gauge) of the air
conditioner service station.
Note
♦ Switching pressures and design of refrigerant circuit switches
are vehicle-specific.
♦ The pressures must be measured at the service connections;
the fitting locations of these connections are vehicle-specific
⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop manual).

7.3.1 Specifications for pressures in refriger‐
ant circuit
High-pressure side:
Increasing from initial pressure (on connecting pressure gauges)
up to max. 20 bar
Low-pressure end:
Decreasing from initial pressure (on connecting pressure gauges)
to value in graph
A - High pressure in bar
B - Low pressure in bar
C - Permissible tolerance range
