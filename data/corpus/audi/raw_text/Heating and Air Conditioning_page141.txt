Note
♦ If the required values are not attained, compare the measured
values for -G261- and -G262- to one another.
♦ If the measured value of one of the two vent temperature
senders -G261- or -G262- is OK, check actuation and opera‐
tion of the left temperature flap control motor -V158- and the
right temperature flap control motor -V159- ⇒ page 137 ,
⇒ page 140 and ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function of vehicle
diagnostic, testing and information system VAS 5051.
♦ If the measured value for -G261- and / or -G262- is lower than
the measured value of the evaporator output temperature
sender -G263- , check -G263- , -G261- and -G262- for proper
installation and contact resistance in the electrical connec‐
tions. Replace the defective sender if applicable ⇒ "Guided
fault-finding" function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and infor‐
mation system VAS 5051 .
♦ If no fault is found at the left footwell vent temperature sender
-G261- , the right footwell vent temperature sender -G262- ,
the evaporator output temperature sender -G263- , the left
temperature flap control motor -V158- and the right tempera‐
ture flap control motor -V159- , perform the measures to be
taken in the event of temperature increase downstream of the
evaporator ⇒ page 137 .
♦ The temperature of the air flowing out of the “Centre” dash
panel vents can also be measured using a commercially avail‐
able thermometer for example.
♦ Problems relating to differences between the temperature of
the air emitted from the vents with an identical setting in air
conditioner control mode may be due to the following: Tem‐
perature flaps in air distributor housing not closing fully or not
attaining end position ⇒ page 124 and ⇒ "Guided fault-finding"
function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and information system
VAS 5051. Air in heat exchanger, fluctuating flow through heat
exchanger and thus uneven heat distribution ⇒ page 140 .
Detachment of foam seal on heat exchanger ins t a l lation, al‐
lowing air to flow past heat exchanger Air conditioner refriger‐
ant circuit not filled with the correct amount of refrigerant.

not match specification
The cooling output required is not attained in the cooling output
test ⇒ page 131 .
– Select the “Reading measured value block” function ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function of vehicle diag‐
nostic, testing and information system VAS 5051.
– Repeat cooling output test ⇒ page 130 .
– During the cooling output test observe the displays for actuation of the air conditioner compressor reg‐
ulating valve -N280- and the pressure in the refrigerant circuit.
– -N280- deactivated during cooling output test (control current dropped below 0.50 A) ?
