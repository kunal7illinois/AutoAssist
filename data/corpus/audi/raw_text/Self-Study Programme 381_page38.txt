Wheels and tyres
Design and function
Using a new evaluation method, it is now possible
to detect simultaneous pressure loss to at multiple
wheels. Tyre pressures are monitored simultane-
ously using two different concepts.
1. Tyre circumference monitoring 2. Tyre vibration monitoring
– Tyre circumference decreases as a function of – Torsional vibration is excited in each tyre while
loss of pressure. As a result the wheel must rolling, due to road surface unevenness. These
