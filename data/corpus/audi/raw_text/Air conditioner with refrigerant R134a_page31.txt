Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.4.2 Connections with primary sealing valve
(ball valve)
WARNING
Before unscrewing connection, connect air conditioner service
station and extract refrigerant. The refrigerant circuit must be
empty; danger of injury.
Connection with high-pressure valve
1 - Connection with internal thread (soldered in)
2 - O-ring (version and identification: black or coloured ⇒ Elec‐
tronic parts catalogue )
3 - Valve with external thread and groove for O-ring (designa‐
tion: Ball valve)
4 - Seal for sealing cap
5 - Sealing cap
Note
♦ Following connection, carefully screw the handwheel of the
service coupling into the quick-release coupling adapter to the
extent required to reliably open the valve in the service con‐
nection (observe the pressure gauge; take care not to open
the valve too far).
♦ To remove and install the valve -3- with the refrigerant circuit
drained, make use of an adapter from the socket -T10364- for
example.
♦ There are different versions of these valves (with internal or
external thread) and the tightening torques may therefore also
differ. The tightening torque for the valves -3- used at present
with an M12 x 1.5 mm external thread is 9 Nm +- 1 Nm.
♦ There are different versions of these valves and the corre‐
sponding sealing caps. Attention is to be paid to the correct
version of the valve and correct assignment of the sealing cap
