General notes
The radio units receive their signals via two tuners with “phase
diversity” and one aerial connection each (AM/FM1 and FM2).
Along with “switching diversity”, “phase diversity” is the second
feature designed to reduce interference in the incoming radio sig‐
nals.
This requires at least two aerials with aerial amplifiers and a radio
unit with two tuners.
If the incoming signal is affected by interference, the two signals
are digitalised in the radio unit after passing through the tuners,
and then separated in such a way that the interference is largely
eliminated.
If there is no interference in the incoming signal, the radio unit will
continuously compare the signals from the two aerials (amplifiers)
to determine which is the stronger signal. This is then passed on
accordingly.
In this case, the second tuner will scan through the frequency
band in the background to locate better reception frequencies for
the current station. If a better signal is found, this tuner will then
be used for reception and the other tuner is faded into the back‐
ground.
Communication with other vehicle systems takes place via the
CAN Bus (Infotainment) and data bus diagnostic interface -J533- .
