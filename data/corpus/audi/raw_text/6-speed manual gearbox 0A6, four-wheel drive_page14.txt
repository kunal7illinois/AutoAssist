Clutch actuation
♦ Ensure that the pressure plate is kept straight: loosen and
tighten bolts consecutively in steps of 90°.
♦ If the clutch has burnt out, thoroughly clean the clutch housing,
flywheel and parts of the engine facing the gearbox in order to
prevent odour.
♦ Only blow out dual-mass flywheel with compressed air.
♦ Pressure plates have an anti-corrosion coating and are
greased. With the exception of the friction surface for the
clutch plate, the pressure plate may not be cleaned. Otherwise
the service life of the clutch will be considerably reduced.
♦ The friction surface of the pressure plate and the dual-mass
flywheel must be cleaned (degreased) thoroughly.
♦ If the clutch pedal does not return to its initial position after it
is released (clutch pedal in rest position), you must bleed the
clutch system.
