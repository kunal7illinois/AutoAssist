Design of the "electrically adjustable rear spoiler"
The "electrically adjustable rear spoiler" consists of two components which can be ordered separately:
● the rear spoiler module
● the spoiler wing
A DC motor mounted on the rear spoiler module transmits a rotary movement to the input shaft vi a gear and
special joint (four-way joint). The shaft converts this movement to a lifting movement by means of left and
right reversing mechanisms. The lifting movement moves the spoiler wing mounted on the rear spoiler
module from the lower limit position to the upper limit position or vice versa, depending on momentary
position of the rear spoiler.
Two limit switches for detecting the lower and upper limit positions are actuated by the four-way joint.
