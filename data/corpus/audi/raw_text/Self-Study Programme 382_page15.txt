Display of cruise control system speed setting
When the cruise control system is active, the current speed setting is indicated on the centre display of the
dash panel insert in the Audi TT Coupé ´07. If one of the two onboard computer levels is shown on the centre
display, the set speed is indicated continuously. The speed is normally displayed in the position where the
ambient temperature is indicated.
If the digital speedometer is shown on the centre display or if it is currently being used by the navigation
system, the set speed is displayed after activating the cruise control system for 3 seconds, after which the
display returns automatically to the original screen.
After "terminal 15 on", the function shown on the dash panel insert centre display before "terminal 15 off" is
restored. In the example below, the digital speedometer is displayed.
