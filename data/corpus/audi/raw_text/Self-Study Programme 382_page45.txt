Simultaneous navigation and CD playback
With the BNS 5.0 navigation system, it is possible to
navigate and listen to CDs simultaneously. For this
purpose, the system is equipped with an internal
memory into which the required map data can be
loaded after entering the navigation destination.

After entering the route, the system first computes
the distance to the route destination.
Enter navigation route
The map features of the route are then copied to
a memory integrated in the system. If the CD is
removed during the copy process, the system
displays the following query
"Do you want to cancel loading the route features?"
to indicate that the corridor has not been loaded
comple tely.

After completing the copy process, the navigation
CD can easily be removed.
The map data copied to the internal memory is also
available for navigating to other route destinations
within the copied area. This means that it is not
necessary to load the navigation CD to navigate to
each new navigation destination.
