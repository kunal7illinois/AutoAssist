1 Contact corrosion
Contact corrosion can occur if unsuitable fasteners (bolts, nuts,
washers, etc.) are used.
For this reason, only fasteners with a special surface coating are
fitted.
Furthermore, rubber components or plastic components and ad‐
hesives are made of non-conductive material.
Always fit new components if you are not sure that the old com‐
ponents are suitable ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
Note:
♦ We recommend the use of genuine replacement parts only;
they have been tested and are compatible with aluminium.
♦ We recommend using Audi Genuine Accessories.
♦ Damage resulting from contact corrosion is not covered by
warranty.
