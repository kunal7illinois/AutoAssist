2 Contact corrosion
Contact corrosion can occur if unsuitable fasteners (bolts, nuts,
washers etc.) are used on the vehicle.
For this reason, only fasteners with a special surface coating are
fitted.
In addition, all rubber and plastic parts and all adhesives are made
of non-conductive materials.
Always install new parts as listed in the Parts catalogue if you are
not sure whether used parts can be reused.
Important:
♦ We recommend using genuine replacement parts only, as
these have been checked and are compatible with aluminium.
♦ We recommend using Audi Genuine Accessories.
♦ Damage caused by contact corrosion is not covered by the
warranty.
