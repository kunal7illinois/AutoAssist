1.2 Safety precautions
Note the following if testers and measuring instruments have to
be used during a road test:
WARNING
Accidents can be caused if the driver is distracted by test
equipment while road-testing, or if test equipment is not prop‐
erly secured.
Injuries can also be caused if the passenger's airbag is trig‐
gered in a collision.
• The use of test equipment while driving causes distraction.
• There is an increased risk of injury if test equipment is not
secured.
♦ Move the passenger's seat back as far as it will go.
♦ Use only vehicle diagnosis and service information sys‐
tem -VAS 5052- or diagnosis system -VAS 5053- .
♦ The test equipment -1- must rest flat on the passenger's
thighs (as shown in illustration) and must be operated by
the passenger.
WARNING
The fuel system is pressurised. The fuel pressure in the high-
pressure part of the injection system must be reduced to a
residual pressure prior to opening; for procedure see
⇒ page 4 .
The connection must be opened immediately after reducing
the pressure; wrap a cloth a round the connection and allow the
residual pressure (approx. 6 bar) to dissipate.
To avoid any risk of injuries to persons and/or damage to the fuel
injection and ignition system, always observe the following safety
precautions.
