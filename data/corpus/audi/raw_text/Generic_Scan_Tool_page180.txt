Checking voltage
Note
The engine MUST be at ambient temperature and have at least
8 hours off time for the ECM to operate the Secondary Air Injection
(SAI) system. The SAI system may operate for as little as 10 sec‐
onds, up to 55 seconds depending on ambient temperature.
– Ignition switch Off.
– Using a multimeter, check the Secondary Air In jection (SAI)
Pump Motor --V101-- electrical harness connector terminal 2
to ground for voltage. When ready, start the engine while mon‐
itoring the reading.
– Start the engine.
Specified value: Battery voltage.
– Switch the ignition OFF.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Check the wiring connection from the Secondary Air Injection
(SAI) Pump Relay --J299-- socket 2 (relay terminal 87) to the
Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Pump Motor --V101-- electrical
harness connector terminal 2 for an open circuit or a short cir‐
cuit.
– Check the wiring connections for damage, corrosion, loose or
broken terminals or an open fuse. Refer to the wiring diagram.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection, replace fuse
if needed.
If the wiring has no fault, the fuse is not open and voltage is Not
present at the pump:
– Perform the Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Pump Relay --
J299-- test.
If the specified value was obtained:
Checking Ground
– Using a multimeter, check the Secondary Air Injection (SAI)
Pump Motor --V101-- electrical harness connector terminal 1
to Ground for resistance.
Specified value: 1.5 Ω Max.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Check the wiring for an open or high resistance.
– Check the electrical harness connector for damage, corrosion,
loose or broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is found in the wiring and voltage supply was
OK:
– Replace Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Pump Motor --V101-- .
– Erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
– Perform a road test to verify repair.
