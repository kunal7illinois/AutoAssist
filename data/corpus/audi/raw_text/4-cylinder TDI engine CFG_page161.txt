Audi TT 2007 ➤
4-cylinder TDI engine (2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail - generation II), mechanics - Edition 05.2010
Procedure
• Tightening torques
⇒ “1.1 Oil pump, sump, balance shaft assembly - exploded
view”, page 144
• Crankshaft locked in position with crankshaft stop -T10050- .
Note
♦ The spur gear drive of the balance shaft assembly must be
installed with a backlash of 0.038 ... 0.072 mm.
♦ To achieve the correct backlash, a suitably thick coating is al‐
ready applied to the new idler gear. The coating is applied to
the teeth on parts of the circumference.
♦ The coating is worn down rapidly and the backlash is then
correct.
♦ A new balance shaft assembly must always be installed in
conjunction with a new idler gear which has the correct coat‐
ing.
♦ Renew the bolts tightened with specified tightening angle.
Caution
Thrust washer can slip out of position behind idler gear.
♦ Before positioning balance shaft assembly, slacken off
bolt for idler gear as specified below, but not further. In‐
stallation position of thrust washer ⇒ page 146
– Slacken bolt -1- for idler gear by approx. 45°.
– If not already fitted, fit dowel sleeves into cylinder block for
centring balance shaft assembly.
– Attach balance shaft assembly to cylinder block.
• Take care not to damage the coating of the idler gear.
