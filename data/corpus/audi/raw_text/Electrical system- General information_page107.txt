5 Repairing aerial wires
A repair method has been developed for repairing aerial wires.
Instead of a complete aerial wire, connecting wires of different
lengths and various adapter wires are now available as replace‐
ment parts.
Replacement parts ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue; Special cata‐
logue „Electrical connecting elements“; Accessories; Sub-group
35 from chart 035-20 onwards .
Note
♦ Do not repair aerial wires. The wiring must be renewed using
connecting wires and adapter wires (available as genuine re‐
placement parts).
♦ These genuine replacement parts are suitable for all wire
cross-sections and aerial wires which have to be renewed.
♦ It is not possible to renew individual aerial connectors during
repair work.
♦ The replacement wires can be used for all previously fitted
wiring cross-sections on all Au di models.
♦ All adapter wires and connecting wires are suitable for all
transmission and reception signals.
♦ The repair method can also be used for testing and service
installation purposes (e.g. retrofitting).
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ -1- Adapter wire for connection to radio; length: approx. 30 cm
♦ -2- Connecting wire; various lengths available
♦ -3- Adapter wire for connection to aerial; length: approx. 30 cm
Procedure
Example: Aerial wire from radio to aerial defective

ure out overall length of aerial connection to be replaced in
vehicle.
