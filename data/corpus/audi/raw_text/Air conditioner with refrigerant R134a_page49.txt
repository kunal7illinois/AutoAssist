4.1 Important repair notes for air condition‐
ing systems
• Air conditioners for refrigerant R12 may only be f i l led with re‐
frigerant R134a if certain prerequisites are satisfied
⇒ page 44 and ⇒ Workshop Manual: Air conditioner with re‐
frigerant R12 Part 2 and 3 . This Workshop Manual is only
available in hardcopy form.
• The refrigerant oils specifically developed for R134a and R12
refrigerant circuits are never to be mixed.
• Air conditioner service stations which come into contact with
the refrigerant should only be used for the intended refrigerant.
• The components of an R134a refrigerant circuit are accord‐
ingly labelled, marked with green stickers or designed (e.g. a
different thread) such that interchange with components for
refrigerant R12 is not possible.
• The refrigerant being used is indicated by a label affixed to the
lock carrier in the engine compartment or in the plenum cham‐
ber.
• Never mix various refrigerants.
Note
When working on the refrigerant circuit, always pay attention the
information given in the Sections on „Safety measures“
⇒ page 13 and „Basic rules for working on refrigerant circuit“
⇒ page 14 .
4.2 Converting refrigerant circuits from re‐
frigerant R12 to refrigerant R134a
CFC refrigerants are no longer used in the automotive industry.
For conversion of refrigerant circuits from R12 to R134a and
servicing converted circuits, refer to
⇒ Workshop Manual: Air conditioner with refrigerant R12 Parts 2
and 3 (this Workshop Manual is only available in printed form).
