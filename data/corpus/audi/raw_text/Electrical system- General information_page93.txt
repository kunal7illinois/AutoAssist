2.3 Fitting seals for individual wires
Procedure
Note
♦ Wire seals prevent water and dirt from ingressing into the con‐
nector housing. They are fitted e.g. in the engine compartment
and must always be re-installed after completing a repair.
♦ As a standard, wire seal is crimped to wire together with con‐
nector. This is not the case with repair wires. Wire seal must
be slipped onto wire before crimping repair wire.
♦ Wire seals must always match the wire cross section of the
repair wire used. The outer diameter of the wire seal depends
on the diameter of the connector housing slot. Always use the
appropriate assembly tool when fitting.
– Attach wire seal -A- to free end of repair wire.
• The small diameter of the wire seal must face the connector
housing.
