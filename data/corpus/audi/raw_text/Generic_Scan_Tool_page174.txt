– Switch the ignition ON.
– Using a multimeter, check the Engine Control Module (ECM)
Power Supply Relay Box socket 4, (relay terminal 86) to
Ground.
Specified value: Battery voltage.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Remove Fuse SD3 (2011 >) in Fuse Panel D and check re‐
sistance of circuit between fuse and relay terminal socket 1.
Refer to Wiring Diagrams for pin locations.
Specified value: 1.5 ohm or less.
