The extruded aluminium sills significantly increase These impressive results are basically
the rigidity of the bodyshell. attributable to three factors:
The much higher rigidity is achieved thanks to a
modified inner geometry. – selective use of materials according to their
The result is best-in-class static torsional rigidity. function
– the special bodyshell construction
