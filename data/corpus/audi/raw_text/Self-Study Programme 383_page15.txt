Structural bonding
In certain areas, adhesive bonding is used supplementary to clinched joints and punch riveted joints, solid
punch riveted joints, Flow Drill screw connections and resistance spot welds. This improves joint strength.
Adhesive bonding is also used for strengthening of seam joints, e.g. in the rear wheel arch. In other areas of
the body, adhesive beads are used for sealing and insulation between aluminium and steel sheets, as well as
for noise reduction.
