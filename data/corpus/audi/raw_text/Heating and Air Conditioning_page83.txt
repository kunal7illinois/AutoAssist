Note
♦ Different versions of the sunlight penetration photosensor -
G107- are available. Attention is therefore to be paid to correct
assignment ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue . If the sunlight pen‐
etration photosensor -G107- fitted is not of the type intended
for this vehicle (signal emitted is not the one specified in the
air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- ),
the air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic control unit -
J255- cannot evaluate the signal from the sunlight penetration
photosensor -G107- and there will be problems with air con‐
ditioner control.
♦ Vehicles with no air conditioner (heater only) are not fitted with
a sunlight penetration photosensor -G107- . Such vehicles
have a cap in place of the sunlight penetration photosensor -
G107- .
