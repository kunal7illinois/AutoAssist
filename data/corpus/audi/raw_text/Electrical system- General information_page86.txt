After crimping, hot air blower must be used to shrink-fit crimp
connector to prevent moisture from ingressing.
– Attach shrink element for hot air blower -VAS 1978/15A- to hot
air blower, 220 V/ 50 Hz -VAS 1978/14A- .
Caution
Risk of damage to surrounding components.
♦ When shrinking crimp connectors, take care not to dam‐
age any other pipes/wires, plastic parts or insulating ma‐
terial with hot nozzle of the hot air blower.
♦ Always observe operating instructions for hot air blower.
– Working from centre outwards, use hot air blower to heat crimp
connector in longitudinal direction until it is completely sealed
and adhesive emerges at ends.
• A wire repaired using a single crimp connector must look as
shown in illustration.
Note
♦ If several wires have to be repaired, make sure crimp connec‐
tors are not directly adjacent to one another. Offset the crimp
connectors slightly to restrict the size of the wiring harness.
♦ If the repair location was previously wrapped, yellow adhesive
tape must be wrapped around this location again on comple‐
tion of repair.
♦ If necessary, secure the repaired wiring harness with a cable
tie to prevent rattling noises when the vehicle is driven.
