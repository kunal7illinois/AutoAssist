Audi TT 2007 ➤
Heating and Air Conditioning - Edition 04.2009
– Caused by leakage at the exhaust system
– Caused by exhaust gas ingressing into the passenger com‐
partment e.g. on reversing (on driving through a cloud of
exhaust fumes).
♦ Fishy smell of coolant
– Caused by leakage at engine cooling system or air conditioner
heat exchanger
Note
If the fishy smell varies with the set temperature (less noticeable
in “cold” temperature setting than in “warm” temperature setting),
check the heat exchanger of the air conditioner unit for leaks (no
constant flow of air through the heat exchanger).
♦ Scorched clutch smell
♦ Odour given off by floor coverings, retrofitted loose seat covers
etc.
♦ Mouldy smell from plenum chamber
– Caused by accumulation and deposits of foreign matter such
as leaves, pine needles etc.
– Caused by water not able to drain out of the plenum chamber.
Note
Check plenum chamber water drains ⇒ page 67 .
♦ Odour from air conditioner unit
Note
♦ Odours occurring in the air conditioner unit are usually per‐
ceptible in both fresh air and recirculated-air mode. If an odour
nuisance only occurs in fresh-air mode or only in recirculated-
air mode, the air conditioner unit is not normally the cause of
the problem.
♦ If a heat exchanger is leaking, the smell of escaping coolant
generally varies with the temperature set. In the “cold” tem‐
perature setting, there is no flow of air through the heat ex‐
changer and the odour is less perceptible.
– Caused by too much condensate in the air conditioner unit
Note
Check condensate drain ⇒ page 84 .
– Caused by old or severely contaminated dust and pollen filter
Note
Check dust and pollen filter ⇒ page 96 .
– Caused by deposits on evaporator fins
