Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ As replacement air conditioner compressors are supplied with
different oil capacities, the exact part no. must be heeded ⇒
Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pressures and re‐
duced air conditioner cooling output. Too little oil may lead to
lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor. The
specified refrigerant oil quantities are therefore to be heeded.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
