Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ The Audi A8 is fitted with different air conditioner compressors
depending on the engine and production period.
♦ As replacement air conditioner compressors of this type are
supplied with different oil capacities, the exact part number
must be heeded ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-spe‐
cific workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ At the start of production, the compressor types in the first two
lines of the table were supplied with a refrigerant oil quantity
of 200 cm3 . These air conditioner compressors can be rec‐
ognised from the index of the part number (4E0 260 805 with
index „C“, „D“, „E“, „F“, „J“, „L“ or „S“). In Model Year 2004 (as
of approx. 01.04), a gradual change was made to other types
of compressor with a refrigerant oil quantity of 150 cm3 . These
air conditioner compressors can be recognised from the index
of the part number (4E0 260 805 with index „G“, „H“, „T“, „M“,
„N“, „Q“ or double index e.g. „ AB“) ⇒ Electronic parts cata‐
logue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
