Removing
Caution
If the turbocharger has suffered mechanical damage (e.g.
damaged compressor wheel), it is not sufficient merely to fit a
new turbocharger. The following work must be performed in
order to avoid further damage:
♦ Check air cleaner housing, air filter element and air intake
hoses for dirt and foreign particles.
♦ Check the entire charge air system (including the charge
air cooler) for foreign matter.
♦ If foreign matter is found in the charge air system, clean
all relevant ducts and hoses and renew charge air cooler
if necessary.
