1 General notes and safety precau‐
tions
1.1 General notes on ignition system
♦ The engine control unit has a self-diagnosis capability.
♦ A voltage of at least 11.5 V is required for proper operation of
the electrical components.
♦ Certain tests may lead to a fault being detected by the control
unit and stored. The fault memory should therefore be inter‐
rogated and (if necessary) erased after completing the tests
and any repair work that may be required.
♦ If the engine starts, runs for a short period and then cuts out
after completing fault finding, repairs or component tests, this
may be due to the immobiliser disabling the engine control
unit. The fault memory must then be interrogated and, if nec‐
essary, the control unit must be adapted.
