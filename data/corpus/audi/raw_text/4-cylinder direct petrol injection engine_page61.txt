Note
Arrow points in direction of travel.
Top bearing shells of the correct thickness are allocated to the
cylinder block at the factory. Coloured dots are used to identify
the thickness of the bearing shells.
Letter codes on the lower sealing surface of the cylinder block
indicate the thickness of the bearing shell to be fitted at each lo‐
cation.
G = Yellow
B = Blue
W = White
Note
♦ Use blue bearing shells if the identification is no longer visible.
♦ The bottom crankshaft bearing shells are only supplied as re‐
placement parts with “yellow” marking.
