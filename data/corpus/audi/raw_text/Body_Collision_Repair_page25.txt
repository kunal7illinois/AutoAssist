(e.g. Audi 80)
The following procedure is used when repairing bonded points:
Separating procedure: ⇒ page 19
7.1.1 Separating procedure:
– Roughly cut out roof to gain access to the bonded point.
– Cut through bonded point with oscillating knife.
7.2 Types of Bonding
To increase body rigidity and strength, adhesive and spot-weld
bonded joints are being increasingly used in production. They are
differen t i a ted as follows:
High-strength bonded joints ⇒ page 19
Spot-weld bonded joints ⇒ page 19
7.2.1 High-strength bonded joints
In bonded joints, the sheet metal parts are only bonded by adhe‐
sive.
The distance of the high-strength adhesive surfaces to each
should not be less than 2 mm or greater than 4 mm. If necessary,
the adhesive surfaces must be prepared.
Repair measures
– The bonded joints are restored with the materials specified in
the repair manual or replacement parts program.
7.2.2 Spot-weld bonded joints
In spot-welded bonded joints, an electrically conductive adhesive
is used between the panels, allowing good root penetration for
spot welding.
