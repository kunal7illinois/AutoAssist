SST tyres have run-flat capability because of their modified design compared to conventional tyres.
Much stiffer tyre sidewalls enable the vehicle to drive on for up to 50km at a maximum speed of 80kph even
after a total loss of pressure.
Special wheels are used for the SST tyres due to the modified tyre geometry. The special 17" wheels on the
Audi TT Coupé ‘07 can be used both for conventional tyres and for SST tyres. In the case of the 18" wheels,
conventional tyres are available in combination with conventional rims. SST tyres are always combined with
the low tyre pressure indicator.
