fall to the floor immediately, but rather stay in the air for some time.
Only perform surface or cutting work with ventilation.
Only use wire brush on high-grade steel.
Grinding disks should not be used because of their lubricating
effect.
Use P 80 to P 200 grit sanding discs.
Only use sanding discs, drill bit, drill and cutting discs with clean‐
ing block DA 009 802.
Commercially-available sanding materials can be used on alumi‐
num without the cleaning block.
