Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ The Audi A6 with 8-cyl. engine is fitted with „Denso“ air con‐
ditioner compressors.
♦ In August/ September 1998 production was gradually switch‐
ed from air conditioning unit version „1“ to air conditioning unit
version „2“. Vehicles with an 8-cyl. engine are only fitted with
air conditioning unit from version „2“ onwards.
♦ The different air conditioner unit versions can be identified on
the basis of certain characteristics described in the workshop
manual ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific work‐
shop manual).
♦ Different condensers were installed in vehicles with 8-cylinder
engines. Exclusive use was made for USA vehicles of con‐
densers with part no. 4B3 260 401 (403) C, D, E.
♦ In March 1999, production was gradually switched from con‐
densers with part number 4B3 260 401 (403) B to condensers
with part number 4B3 260 401 (403) C.
♦ If the condenser fitted is replaced by one with a different part
number, amend the capacity specified on the label or affix a
label with the modified capacity over the existing label. The
part number can be found on a sticker attached to the bottom
of the condenser ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-
specific workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
Flat tube dimensions of condenser
Note
♦ Production was gradually switched from calendar week 45,
1998 onwards (initially for Audi A6 with 6-cyl. diesel engine) to
a condenser with smaller flat tubes.
♦ Pay attention to the part number on condenser replacement
(sometimes the only distinguishing feature) ⇒ Electronic parts
catalogue .
Condensers -A- with flat tube dimensions -B- = 20 mm and -C- =
3.0 mm must be filled with more refrigerant than condensers -D-
with flat tube dimensions -E- = 18 mm or 16 mm and -F- = 1.7 mm
