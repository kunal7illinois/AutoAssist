Caution
The clutch plates can slip out of position inside the multiple
clutch unit.
♦ If the drive plate becomes detached from the splines in the
outer plate carrier, the clutch plates can slip out of position
in the multiple clutch. It will then no longer be possible to
adjust the clutch correctly.
♦ To prevent the clutch plates from slipping inside the mul‐
tiple clutch unit, keep the drive plate pressed into the outer
plate carrier with both thumbs during all following steps.
Note
The circlip for the drive plate that is supplied with the replacement
parts is fitted at a later stage.
– Take new circlip for drive plate out of packaging and place to
one side.
– Take multiple clutch out of packaging, holding drive plate in
position.
– First fit old circlip -A- for drive plate from removed multiple
clutch.
• Installation position: the lug on the drive plate and the colour-
marked splines on the outer plate carrier must be located
between the ends of the circlip.
– Using a screwdriver, check that circlip is fully engaged.
– Check that the 4 oil seals on the hub on the underside of the
multiple clutch are correctly seated; engage in position if nec‐
essary.
