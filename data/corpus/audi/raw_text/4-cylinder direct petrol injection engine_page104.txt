3 Valve gear
Note
♦ Cylinder head and retaining frame must be renewed together.
♦ After installing camshafts, wait for approx. 30 minutes before
starting engine. Hydraulic valve compensation elements have
to settle (otherwise valves will strike pistons).
♦ After working on the valve gear, turn the engine carefully at
least 2 rotations to ensure that none of the valves make con‐
tact when the starter is operated.
♦ Always fit new seals and gaskets.
