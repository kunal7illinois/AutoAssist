2.35 Windshield Wiper Blades, Checking
End Position and for Damage
Windshield Wiper Blade Park Position
Note
♦ Every second time it is switched off, the wiper motor runs to
an over-stroke parked position, that ensures that the lip of the
wiper blade is flipped to the other direction.
♦ For this to happen, the wiper motor runs downward to the end
position and then back up again very slightly. This over-stroke
parked position must not be used for aligning/checking the
wiper crank.
♦ The position where the wiper motor runs directly to end posi‐
tion must be used. Activate mist wipe again, if necessary.
– Switch windshield wipers on and off and allow to run to end
position.
– Turn the ignition off.
– Check if the windshield wiper blade tips are positioned with the
following distances to the plenum chamber cowl panel grille at
the bottom of the windshield:
♦ Dimension -a- = 5 mm +10 mm
♦ Dimension -b- = 24 mm + 10
– Adjust the wiper arm if necessary. Refer to ⇒ Electrical Equip‐
ment; Rep. Gr. 92 ; Removal and Installation
Note
The dimensions give the distance of the wiper blade point to the
black cowl panel on lower edge of windshield. Place m ent is sim‐
ilar for RHD vehicles.
