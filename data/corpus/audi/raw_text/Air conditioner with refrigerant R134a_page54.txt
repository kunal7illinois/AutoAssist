Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
– Connect air conditioner service station to power supply.
– Connect the charging hoses of the air conditioner service sta‐
tion to the vehicle refrigerant circuit with quick-release cou‐
pling adapters (refer to vehicle-specific refrigerant circuit) ⇒
Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop manual).
– Screw in the handwheel of the quick-release coupling adapt‐
ers to the extent required to reliably open the valves of the
service connections (take care not to open the valve too far).
Note
If you intend to measured the pressure on only one side of the
refrigerant circuit after charging the system (on vehicles with a
service connection), use the valve adapter and filler hose with
valve opener ⇒ page 99 .
– Switch on the air conditioner service station and evacuate the
refrigerant circuit for at least 30 minutes. In this process, the
pressure reading must be less than 10 mbar absolute (corre‐
sponding to a vacuum of 990 mbar).
Note
On the air conditioner service station V.A.G 1885 (for currently
available air conditioner service stations, refer to ⇒ V.A.G work‐
shop equipment catalogue ), the two green LEDs light at this
pressure for example.
– Switch off air conditioner service station and allow to stand for
at least 1 hour.
• If the vacuum display (LED chain) does not change, the sys‐
tem is free of leaks and can be charged.
