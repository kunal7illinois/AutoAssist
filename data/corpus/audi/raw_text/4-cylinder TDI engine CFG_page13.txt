♦ We recommend the use of Audi accessories.
♦ Damage caused by contact corrosion is not covered under
warranty.
4.4 Routing and attachment of pipes, hoses
and wiring
♦ Mark fuel lines, hydraulic lines, vacuum lines, lines for activa‐
ted charcoal filter system and electrical wiring etc. before
removal so they can be re-installed in the original positions
and correctly connected. Make sketches or take photographs
if necessary.
♦ To prevent damaging pipes, hoses and wiring, ensure suffi‐
cient clearance from all moving or hot components in engine
compartment (little space in engine compartment).
4.5 Installing radiators, condensers and
charge air coolers
Even when the radiator, condenser and charge air cooler are cor‐
rectly installed, slight impressions may be visible on the fins of
these components. This does not mean that the components are
damaged. If the fins are only very slightly distorted, this does not
justify renewal of the radiator, charge air cooler or condenser.
4.6 Checking vacuum system
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Hand vacuum pump -VAS 6213-
Procedure
– Check all vacuum lines in the complete vacuum system for:
♦ Cracks
♦ Traces of animal bites
♦ Kinked or crushed lines
♦ Lines porous or leaking
– Check vacuum line to solenoid valve and from solenoid valve
to corresponding component.
– If a fault is stored in the event memory, check the vacuum lines
leading to the relevant component and also check the remain‐
ing vacuum lines in the system.
– If it is not possible to build up a vacuum with the hand vacuum
pump -VAS 6213- or if the vacuum pressure drops again im‐
mediately, check the hand vacuum pump and connecting
hoses for leaks.
