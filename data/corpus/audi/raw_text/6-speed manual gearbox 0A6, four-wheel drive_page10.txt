5 General repair instructions
Proper tools and the maximum possible care and cleanliness are
essential for satisfactory gearbox repairs. The usual basic safety
precautions also naturally apply when carrying out repair work.
A number of generally applicable instructions for the various re‐
pair procedures - which were previously repeated at numerous
places in the Workshop Manual - are summarised here. They ap‐
ply to the work described in this Manual.
5.1 Contact corrosion!
♦ The gearbox housing components can be made of a magne‐
sium or aluminium alloy.
♦ Bolts and other components which are in direct contact with
the gearbox have a surface treatment which is compatible with
the housing material.
♦ If the incorrect parts are used (bolts, nuts, washers etc.), this
will cause contact corrosion and damage the gearbox housing
components.
♦ If you are not sure whether used parts can be re-installed, al‐
ways fit new parts ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
Caution
Damage caused by contact corrosion is not covered under
warranty.
