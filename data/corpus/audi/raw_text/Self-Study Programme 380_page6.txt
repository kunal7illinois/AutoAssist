Body
Audi Space Frame ASF of the Audi TT Coupé ´07
The development targets for the bodyshell of the Audi TT Coupé ‘07
With a weight advantage of 48% over a comparable all-steel bodyshell, not to mention the optimised weight
distribution, the new composite aluminium-steel spaceframe body of the TT Coupé marks yet another
milestone in the development of modern Audi bodyshells.
Crash safety of the bodyshell is enhanced by load-bearing structures at the front, sides and rear end with
a heavy emphasis on pedestrian safety.
To ensure efficient volume bodyshell production, various new joining and production techniques are
employed.
The repair concept is to a large extent based on the well-known aluminium repair concept, although
combining the materials aluminium and steel meant, of course, that new approaches had to be taken.
