lease lock) hinders the release of the mechanically activated belt
tensioner in an accident.
WARNING
With belt tensioners with load detection, the belt webbing must
not be pulled out when performing separation work, straight‐
ening work or dent removal. If strong shaking motions are
generated by separating work, straightening work or dent re‐
moval, the belt tensioners with load detection must be re‐
moved.
