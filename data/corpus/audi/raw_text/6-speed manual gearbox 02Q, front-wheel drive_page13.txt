6-speed manual gearbox 02Q, front-wheel drive - Edition 04.2010
Nuts, bolts
♦ Loosen the nuts and bolts in reverse sequence to the specified
tightening sequence.
♦ Nuts and bolts which secure covers and housings should be
loosened and tightened in diagonal sequence and in stages if
no tightening sequence is specified.
♦ Renew self-locking nuts and bolts.
♦ The tightening torques stated apply to non-oiled nuts and
bolts.
♦ Threaded holes which take self-locking bolts or bolts coated
with locking fluid must be cleaned (using a tap or similar). Oth‐
erwise there is a danger of the bolts shearing off the next time
they are removed.
♦ For all threaded connections, ensure that (where applicable)
the contact surfaces and the nuts and bolts are not coated with
wax until after assembly is completed.
Bearings
♦ Install new tapered roller bearings as supplied; do not lubricate
additionally with oil.
♦ Lubricate all bearings (except tapered roller bearings) with
gear oil before installing in gearbox.
♦ Use inductive heater -VAS 6414- to heat inner races of tapered
roller bearings to approx. 100°C before installing. Press home
onto stop when installing so there is no axial clearance.
♦ Do not interchange inner or outer races of bearings of the
same size.
♦ If required, renew the tapered roller bearings on one shaft to‐
gether and use new bearings from a single manufacturer.
♦ Install needle bearings so the lettering (side with thicker metal)
faces towards the installing tool.
Shims
♦ Use a micrometer to measure the shims at several points. Dif‐
ferent shim thicknesses make it possible to obtain the exact
thickness required.
♦ Check for burrs and damage.
♦ Install only shims which are in perfect condition.
