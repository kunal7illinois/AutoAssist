25 Flanging
The outer side panel is delivered pre-hardened.
Therefore, flanging requires a special procedure and is carried
out in 2 steps.
– 1. Bend flange up with pliers. Maintain radius R = 2.5 mm.
– 2. Fasten upper area with hammer using counterhold. Radius
R = 2.5 mm must be maintained when doing so.
If the radius is not maintained the side panel could tear.
A level bond must be provided between inner and outer parts in
shaded area.
