Aerial system
Radios with phase diversity have two aerial inputs
which can be diagnosed individually. The radios
differ in this respect from the previous radios or the
current radio navigation systems.
Radios with phase diversity do not have a separate
diversity switch.The Diversity function is integrated
in the radio. Only one aerial is connected to each of
the two radio aerial inputs, thus simplifying FM2 FM1 / AM
diagnosis. Each aerial signal can be read out in
a separate data block.
Although only two aerials are used, reception
quality and interference immunity are better than
those of the previous systems.

Note
Different aerials are used by the new radios and navigation systems. For this reason, radios
cannot be replaced with navigation systems in the unchanged FM aerial system. Reception is
much poorer when the wrong aerial system is used.
Although different FM aerials are used, the radios and navigation systems have the same aerial
connectors. The differences between the aerials are described on page 52.
