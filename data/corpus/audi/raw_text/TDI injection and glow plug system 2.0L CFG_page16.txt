WARNING
♦ Always read rules for cleanliness and instructions for
working on fuel system ⇒ page 2 .
♦ Follow these instructions and rules for cleanliness before
starting work and while working on the fuel system.
Caution
The high-pressure fuel pump has very close tolerances and
must not be allowed to run without fuel. To prevent this and to
enable the engine to start quickly after parts have been re‐
newed, it is important to observe the following:
♦ If components of the fuel system between the fuel tank
and the high-pressure pump are removed or renewed, the
first fuel filling operation must be performed.
♦ If a fuel pump, fuel line (between fuel tank and high-pres‐
sure pump) or fuel filter is removed or renewed, the fuel
system must be bled before the engine is started for the
first time.
♦ If the high-pressure pump is removed or renewed, the fuel
system must be bled before the engine is started for the
first time.
Procedure for first fuel filling ⇒ page 29
Note
The high-pressure pump will be damaged if the first fuel filling
procedure is not performed.
