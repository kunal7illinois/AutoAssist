Steering system
Electromechanical steering system EPS
The electromechanical steering system EPS which
has proved successful in the Audi A3 is also fea-
tured in the new Audi TT. The following modifica-
tions have been made compared to the Audi A3:
new track rod outer joint with
larger joint diameter and
modified journal geometry
reduced steering angle, steering rack
shortened from 80 mm to 78 mm
new control unit due to new
control software without dsr function
In the case of the Audi TT, the power steering assist maps
are determined by the powertrain type (front wheel drive
or quattro) In the case of the Audi A3, the weight of the
front axle is the determinant factor.
