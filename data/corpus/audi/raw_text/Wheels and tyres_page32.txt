Example:
Wheel slip Wear
Driving off gently 1-2 1
Driving off normally 7-8 5
Driving off with 20 or more 100-200
wheels spinning
Cornering (driving style)
A “sporty” driving style and driving at higher speeds also cause
greater wear when driving through corners.
In practice, this means that wear is increased 16-fold when the
cornering speed is doubled. This is the price that has to be paid
for going faster.
Example: Driving through a corner with a radius of 150 m.
Speed (km/h) Lateral acceleration Wear
in g6)
50 1 = 0.13 g 1
80 2.5 = 0.33 g 6.5
100 4 = 0.53 g 16
6) g = gravitational acceleration: 9.81 m/s2
2.6 Measuring tread depth
Note
♦ The tread depth is measured in the main tread channels.
♦ Do not measure at the TWIs (Tread Wear Indicators).
Measure the tread depth in the main tread channel, at the points
where the tyre is worn most heavily. The main tread channels can
be identified by the TWIs (tread wear indicators). The position of
the TWI indicators is marked at various points on the sidewall of
the tyre. The bars of the TWI have a height of 1.6 mm. This is the
minimum tread depth required by German law.
Different values may apply in other countries.
The TWI indicators must not be included in the measurement.
Tread depth should always be measured at the deepest point of
the tread channel.
A - TWIs (tread wear indicators) in main tread channel. These
indicators are marked at 6 points around the tyre sidewall.
B - -P- is the depth of the main tread channel
