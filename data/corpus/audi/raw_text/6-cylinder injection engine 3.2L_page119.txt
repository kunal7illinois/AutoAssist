Audi TT 2007 ➤
6-cylinder injection engine (3.2 ltr. 4-valve), mechanics - Edition 03.2009
– Set camshafts to “TDC”.
• You should be able to insert the camshaft bar -T10068 A- in
the slots in both camshafts.
– If necessary, turn camshafts at hexagon flats -arrows- to cor‐
rect position using a 32 mm open-end spanner.
Note
The crankshaft must not be at TDC at any cylinder when the
camshafts are turned. Otherwise, there is a risk of damage to
valves and piston crowns.
– Unclip filter -2- on the back of valve timing housing -1- and
clean off any dirt.
– Lightly oil the contact surfaces for the camshaft oil seals in the
valve timing housing.
– Lightly oil contact surfaces of oil seals on the camshafts and
carefully push the valve timing housing over the camshaft oil
seals.
– Secure valve timing housing -arrows-.
– Install camshaft timing chain (adjust valve timing) ⇒ page 89 .
Caution
Avoid damage to valves and piston crowns after working on
valve gear.
♦ The hydraulic tappets have to settle; wait for approx. 30
minutes after installing camshafts before starting engine.
♦ Turn the engine carefully at least 2 rotations to ensure that
none of the valves make contact when the starter is op‐
erated.
