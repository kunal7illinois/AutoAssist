Note
♦ Replacement restrictors with different holes are available (yel‐
low-coloured 1.54 mm, red-coloured 1.42 mm).
♦ Depending on manufacturer, colour of red restrictor may tend
more towards orange.
♦ To avoid altering the cooling output of the air conditioner, re‐
strictors with the same hole diameter must always be used.
♦ A restrictor with a smaller hole (red-coloured) and a condenser
with a smaller internal volume are installed from model year
2002 onwards. The capacity has therefore been slightly modi‐
fied (condenser -70 g, smaller restrictor +50 g) ⇒ Heating, air
