pull air mass meter -G70- out of guide on air cleaner housing.
Installing
To ensure the proper function of the air mass meter -G70- it is
important to observe the following notes and instructions.
Note
♦ If the air filter element is very dirty or wet, dirt or water could
reach the air mass meter -G70- and affect the air mass value.
This would lead to loss of power, since a smaller injection
quantity is calculated.
♦ Always use genuine part for air filter element.
♦ Use a silicone-free lubricant when installing the air hose.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct type of hose clips
