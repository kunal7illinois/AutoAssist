Note
♦ Battery chargers -VAS 5095A- , -VAS 5900- , -VAS 5903- , -
VAS 5904- and -VAS 5906- charge without current and volt‐
age peaks. Batteries can therefore also be charged when
installed. Safety precautions must be observed when doing
so. The chargers have a back-up function enabling them to
supply power to on-board circuits.
♦ If electrical equipment has to be switched on periodically when
performing work on the electrical system and for the „Guided
Fault Finding“ mode, the battery must be charged using a
charger with back-up function so as not to damage the battery
⇒ page 40 .
