4 Rules for cleanliness
Injection system/fuel system
Even small amounts of dirt can cause faults in the injection sys‐
tem. When working on the fuel supply/injection system, please
pay careful attention to the following basic rules:
♦ Carefully clean connection points and the surrounding area
with engine cleaner or brake cleaner and dry thoroughly before
opening.
♦ Plug open lines and connections with suitable protective caps
immediately.
♦ Place parts that have been removed on a clean surface and
cover them over. Use only lint-free cloths.
♦ Only install clean components; replacement parts should only
be unpacked immediately prior to installation. Do not use parts
that have been previously unpacked and stored away loose
(e.g. in toolboxes, etc.).
♦ When the system is open: Do not work with compressed air.
Do not move the vehicle unless absolutely necessary.
♦ Unplugged electrical connectors must be kept clean and dry.
Make sure connections are dry when attaching.

following “5 rules”:
♦ Thoroughly clean all unions and surrounding areas before dis‐
connecting.
♦ Place parts that have been removed on a clean surface and
cover them over. Use only lint-free cloths.
♦ Carefully cover or seal open components if repairs cannot be
carried out immediately.
♦ Only install clean components; replacement parts should only
be unpacked immediately prior to installation. Do not use parts
that have been stored loose (e.g. in tool boxes etc.).
