Specified value: 1.5 Ω max.
If any of the specified values were not obtained:
– Check the wiring for an open circuit, a short circuit to each
other, Battery (+), or Ground (GND).
– Check the electrical harness connector for damage, corrosion,
loose or broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is detected in the wiring and if the voltage supply
was OK:
– Replace the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor -
G71- / Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor -G42- .
– Erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
– Perform a road test to verify repair.
If the DTC does not return:
Repair complete, Generate readiness code. Refer to
⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
– End diagnosis.
If the DTC returns and no malfunction is found in the wiring and
voltage supply was OK:
– Replace the Engine Control Module -J623- . Refer to the serv‐
ice manual for removal and installation procedures.
Assembly is performed in the reverse order of the removal, note
the following:
Final procedures
After repair work, the following work steps must be performed in
the following sequence:
1 - Check the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Memory”,
page 14 .
2 - If necessary, erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
3 - If the DTC memory was erased, generate readiness code.
Refer to ⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
