The new Audi TT Roadster
Unfiltered sportiness, a truly authentic driving experience plus high power reserves – cue the new TT Roadster from
Audi. The open-top sports car has taken all the design cues from its tremendously successful predecessor, but instils
them with even greater emotion, performance and dynamics.
With its rigorous geometry and clarity, the design of the first TT Roadster elevated it to the status of a cult classic.
In designing the new TT Roadster Audi has preserved this charismatic stylistic idiom and carefully honed it for the
new model.
Whereas the tail end and the roof section seem to flow into one another at the rear of the TT Coupé, the convertible
top of the TT Roadster forms a clear contrast that gives the overall design a more geometric look.
This impression is underscored by the athletic curves of the vehicle's flanks just as much as by the rising dynamic line
above the sill area and the taut, muscular shoulder line.
The TT Roadster has a lightweight fabric convertible top which fits in perfectly with the philosophy of puristic open-top
motoring and also offers a number of benefits over a folding steel hard top. It is very light and takes up only a small
amount of space when folded down. The roof is manually operated or electro-hydraulically powered.
Like the TT Coupé, the body of the TT Roadster is also built on the principles of Audi Space Frame ASF® technology,
featuring a pioneering hybrid construction that showcases the brand's tremendous expertise in lightweight design.
