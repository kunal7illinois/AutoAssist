Maintenance Procedures - Edition 08.2011
1.3 Raising Vehicle
WARNING
♦ Before driving the vehicle onto a workshop hoist, make
sure there is enough clearance between any low-lying
components and the hoist.
♦ On the Audi TT's and on the S line vehicles, we recom‐
mend using ramps T 40081 if the lift arms on a vehicle
hoist are too thick to prevent damage.
♦ Before driving a vehicle onto a lifting platform it must be
ensured that the vehicle weight does not exceed the per‐
missible lifting capacity of the platform.
♦ Vehicle may only be lifted at points indicated in illustration
in order to avoid damaging vehicle floor pan and to prevent
vehicle from tipping.
♦ Never start engine and engage a gear with vehicle lifted
so long as even one wheel has contact with the floor!
There is a risk of an accident if this is not observed!
♦ If work is to be performed under vehicle it must be sup‐
ported by suitable stands.
Floor Jack
Always use a suitable rubber or wooden block between the jack
and the vehicle.
A floor jack must be attached only at the mounting points depicted
in the illustration.
Do not lift the vehicle at the engine oil pan, transmission, or on
front or rear axles as serious damage may result.
