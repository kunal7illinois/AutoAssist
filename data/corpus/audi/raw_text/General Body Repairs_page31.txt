Check all spot welds 100% by performing a chisel test.
Good quality weld spots do not shear in the weld contact area but
“peel off” instead.
Calculate the weld nugget diameter according to the following
formula ("peel diameter") and carry out test on samples before
starting repair work.
Square root T1 x 3.5 x 1.15
Note
T1 is the thinnest panel of the welded joint.
e.g. welded joint connecting panels which are 1.5 mm and 0.8 mm
thick
Example: Square root of 0.8 x 3.5 x 1.15 = 3.6 mm weld nugget
diameter
The narrow, welded test strip is rolled or torn off the second sheet
metal strip with a force applied vertically to the surface of the
metal.
If the contact pressure of the welding tongs is not sufficient clamp
the flanges to increase contact pressure.
If welding current from welding transformer is not sufficient for the
welded joint you must make an SG plug weld.
