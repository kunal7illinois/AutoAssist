– Unplug electrical connector -arrow- for body wiring harness

Caution
The following procedure must be followed exactly to prevent
any damage (burning) to wiring, connectors, insulation and
control units. Observe operating instructions for hot air blower.
– Select settings on hot-air blower as shown in illustration, i.e.
set temperature potentiometer -2- to maximum heat output
and two-stage air flow switch -3- to p osition “3”.
Note
♦ Then use hot air blower to heat threaded holes in protective
housing into which shear bolts have been screwed. This re‐
duces the inhibiting action of the locking fluid on the shear bolt
threads and makes it easier to unscrew these bolts.
♦ Cover up all painted parts to avoid any damage caused by hot
air blower or vice-grip pliers.
WARNING
Parts of the protective housing will become very hot as a result
of heating the shear bolts. Take care to avoid burns. Try to
ensure that only the thread is heated and none of the nearby
components. These should be covered if necessary.
– Carry out the following operations on the two shear bolts
-arrows-, one after the other.
