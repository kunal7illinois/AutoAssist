12.8 Detaching and re-attaching refrigerant
pipes from expansion valve
Note
After switching off the air conditioner compressor, a relatively long
period may elapse with this vehicle before the pressure on the
high-pressure end decreases (the expansion valve is cold and the
pressure on the low-pressure end increases rapidly after switch-
off, the expansion valve closes and the refrigerant can only flow
slowly to the low-pressure end).
Detaching
– Switch off ignition.
– Drain the refrigerant circuit ⇒ Air conditioner with refrigerant
R134a.
– Remove the components impeding access to the mounting
points -A- of the heat shield -B- in the engine compartment ⇒
