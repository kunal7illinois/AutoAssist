Air conditioning
Components of the air conditioning system
in the Audi TT Coupé ‘07
Air conditioner compressor
Single acting wobble plate compressor with
6cylinders and variable delivery rate, without
magnetic coupling, externally controlled.
The air conditioner compressor is not a carry-over
part from the Audi A3.
The compressor stroke volume is regulated via the
air conditioning system compressor regulating
valve N280 by means of the PWM signal, depending
on cooling power requirements.

Ambient temperature sensor
Ambient temperature sensor G17 (directly before the condenser)
Only one ambient temperature sensor is used to
evaluate the ambient temperature.
The ambient temperature sensor G17 is located at
the front end, on the right-hand side behind the
bumper, directly in front of the condenser.
Its value is provide by the control unit with display
in dash panel insert J285 via CAN bus.
If the ambient temperature sensor G17 is faulty,
the ECON function is activated. This means that the
active cooling function is deactivated and the AC
LED goes out.

Dash panel temperature sensor G56
Dash panel temperature sensor
The dash panel temperature sensor is integrated in
the housing of the Climatronic control unit J255 and
is ventilated by a suction blower. The temperature
sensor can take on values from -50°C to +77°C.
The dash panel temperature sensor is deactivated if
the temperature sensor or ventilation motor is
faulty. An entry is made in the data memory, and the
Climatronic control unit J255 uses saved substitute
values depending on the temperature set at the
control panel.
