ESP
Operation and displays
The functions of button E256 for ESP and TCS were
extended as follows:
381_025
Briefly pressing the button (<3 s) deactivates only
the TCS function. TCS OFF improves traction when
starting from a stop on loose surfaces (e.g. on snow
or sand).
TCS OFF
TCS OFF is active up to a road speed of 70 kph. TCS
is switched on automatically when this speed is
exceeded.In all-wheel-drive models, TCS is automat-
ically switched off again when the vehicle's road
speed drops below 70 kph. In front-wheel-drive
models, TCS is not automatically switched off when
the vehicle's road s peed drops below this threshold.
381_027
If the button is pressed for longer than 3 s, the ESP
function is switched off.
ESP
When the brake is applied, TCS and ESP are
SWITCHED
switched on again for the duration of the braking
manoeuvre and remain active until a stable driving OFF
condition is restored.
The ESP function is activated automatically if faults
are diagnosed in the magnetic ride system or when
actuating the rear spoiler.
381_027a
If the button is pressed for longer than 10 s, the ESP
function is switched on again and cannot be
switched off again until the ignition has been
