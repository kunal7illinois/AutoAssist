For this reason, only fasteners with a special surface coating are
used.
Additionally, all rubber and plastic parts and all adhesives are
made of non-conductive materials.
Always install new parts if you are not sure whether used parts
can be re-fitted ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .

♦ We recommend using only genuine replacement parts; these
have been tested and are compatible with aluminium.
♦ We recommend the use of Audi accessories.
♦ Damage caused by contact corrosion is not covered under
