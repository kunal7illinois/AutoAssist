2.17 Coolant System, Checking
Note
♦ The additional coolant portion of the mixture must amount to
at least 40% (freeze protection to -13°F [-25°C]) and should
not exceed 60% (freeze protection to -40°F [-40°C]). Other‐
wise the freeze protection will be reduced and the cooling
efficiency will be worsened.
♦ The freeze protection must be ensured to approximately -13°
F (-25 °C).
♦ Freeze protection, refer to the Electronic Parts Catalog.
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Refractometer -T10007-
Note
Read the bright/ark boundary to obtain an accurate reading for
the following tests. Place a drop of water on the glass to improve
the readability of the bright/dark boundary. The bright/dark boun‐
dary can be clearly recognized on the “WATERLINE“.
– Check the concentration of the coolant additive using -
T10007- (operating instructions).
The scale -1- of the refractometer is designed for coolant addi‐
tives G 12, G12 Plus, G12 Plus Plus and G11.
Scale -2- refers only to coolant additive G 13. (begins L80)
Note
♦ The freeze protection must be ensured to approximately -13°
F [-25°C].
♦ If climate conditions make greater freeze protection necessa‐
ry, the amount of can be increased up to 60% (Freeze protec‐
tion to approximately -40°F [-40°C]). Adding more coolant
reduces the freeze protection and reduces the cooling effi‐
ciency.
Coolant Level, Checking and Filling
– Check the coolant level in the reservoir when the engine is
cold.
