6-speed manual gearbox 02S, front-wheel drive - Edition 05.2008
Note
♦ Renew self-locking nuts and bolts when performing assembly
work.
♦ Renew oil seals, gaskets, O-rings and bolts which are tight‐
ened by turning through a specified angle.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct hose clips (as
original equipment); refer to ⇒ Parts catalogue .
♦ All cable ties which are released or cut open during removal
must be fitted in the same position when installing.
♦ Clean input shaft splines and (in the case of a used clutch
plate) the hub splines. Remove corrosion and apply only a very
thin coating of grease -G 000 100- to the splines. Then move
clutch plate backwards and forwards on input shaft until hub
moves freely on shaft. It is important to remove excess grease.
♦ When renewing the gearbox, the gearbox selector lever must
be transferred to the new assembly.
♦ Use thread tap to remove any remaining locking fluid from all
threaded holes which will accommodate self-locking bolts.
♦ Check that dowel sleeves for centralising engine/gearbox are
in the cylinder block; install if necessary.
♦ If the dowel sleeves are not fitted, this will lead to gear-change
problems, clutch malfunction and in some cases gearbox
noise (gears will make rattling noises).
– Make sure that the intermediate plate is engaged on the seal‐
ing flange and fitted on the dowel sleeves -arrows-.
– Check release bearing for wear. Renew slave cylinder and re‐
lease bearing if necessary ⇒ page 25 .
– Check that clutch plate is centralised ⇒ page 44 .
– Incline gearbox via spindles of gearbox support -3282- .
• The differential must face upwards.
• Pivot gearbox downwards in area of 6th gear.
– Then raise gearbox carefully.
– Guide gearbox with differential past subframe -A- and swivel
in direction of -arrow-.
