Note
The combustion chamber ring seal must always be renewed prior
to reinstalling the high-pressure injector.
Illustration shows injector assembly:
1 - Radial compensation element, renew if damaged
2 - Combustion chamber ring seal (teflon ring seal) - renew; when
fitting, do not grease ring or use any other lubricant
3 - Groove on injector
4 - Spacer ring (renew if damaged)
5 - O-ring (renew; apply thin coating of clean engine oil prior to
installation)
6 - Support ring (via this support r i ng, fuel rail exerts force which
secures injector in cylinder head)
– Carefully remove old teflon ring using suitable tools (e.g. cut
open ring using razor blade, or prise open ring with small
screwdriver and then pull off forwards). It is important to en‐
sure that the groove and the continuous ridge in the bottom of
the groove are not damaged.
Note
The injector must be renewed if the groove is damaged.
– Before new teflon ring is fitted, any combustion residue must
be removed from ring groove and injector stem using a clean
cloth.
Note
The illustration shows an injector with “offset connector”. This can
be ignored since it is not relevant when replacing the combustion
chamber ring seal.
