RP welding of galvanised panels
Note the following points when resistance spot welding galvan‐
ised panels:
• The flanges to be welded must make contact. If necessary
clamp together the flanges.
• This is particularly important on high-strength steel panels, as
the electrode force will otherwise not be sufficient.
• Make sure you do not make spot welds with welding tongs
directly next to the clamps, as this would allow a large propor‐
tion of the welding current to drain off in a shunt circuit.
• If the distance between the spot welds is small, place spot
welds in a row or secure by initially welding every third spot
and then fill in the remaining spots. This helps to reduce the
effect of a shunt current.
• Please observe the operating instructions and the information
on correct settings provided by the manufacturer of the weld‐
ing equipment.
Spot weld peel test
To determine the required weld nugget diameter, establish the
setting parameters specified by the manufacturer and carry out
test using samples.
