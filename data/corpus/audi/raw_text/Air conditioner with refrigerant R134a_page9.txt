1.4.1 Physical properties of refrigerant R134a
Chemical formula CH2F–CF3 or CF3–CH2F
Chemical designation Tetrafluoroethane
Boiling point at 1 bar -26.5 °C
Solidification point -101.6 °C
Critical temperature 100.6 °C
Critical pressure 40.56 bar (absolute)
1.4.2 Critical point
The critical point (critical temperature and critical pressure) is that
above which there is no longer a boundary between liquid and
gas.
A substance above its critical point is always in the gaseous state.
At temperatures below the critical point, all types of refrigerant in
pressure vessels exhibit both a liquid and a gas phase, i.e. there
is a layer of gas above the liquid.
As long as both liquid and gas are present in the vessel, the pres‐
sure is governed by ambient temperature ⇒ page 3 „Vapour
pressure table“.
Note
Different types of refrigerant must never be mixed. The refrigerant
specified for the respective air conditioning system must be used
exclusively.
1.4.3 Environmental aspects of refrigerant
R134a
♦ R134a is a fluorocarbon and contains no chlorine.
♦ R134a has a shorter atmospheric lifespan than refrigerant
R12.
♦ R134a does not damage the ozone layer, the ozone depletion
potential is zero.
♦ The global warming potential (GWP) of R134a is 1300 (the
GWP of carbon dioxide = 1).
♦ The global warming effect of R134a is ten times less than that
of refrigerant R12.
