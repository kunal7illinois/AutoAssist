Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ Different air conditioner compressors are fitted depending on
the production period and engine.
♦ At the start of production, „Denso“ type „6 SEU 14C“ or „San‐
den“ type „7 PXE 16“ air conditioner compressors were fitted
⇒ Electronic parts catalogue and ⇒ Heating, air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 .
♦ Depending on the engine, „Delphi“ type „6 CVC 140“ air con‐
ditioner compressors may also be fitted at a later date (intro‐
duction not yet finalised) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue and ⇒
Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 .
♦ These air conditioner compressors are available as replace‐
ment parts with different oil capacitie s and attention must
therefore be paid to the oil quantity in the air conditioner com‐
pressor as well as the exact part number ⇒ Heating, air
conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
