Audi-Space-Frame ASF® of the Audi TT Coupé
The development targets for the bodyshell of the Audi TT
With a weight advantage of 48% over a comparable all-steel bodyshell, in addition to an optimised weight
distribution, the new composite aluminium-steel spaceframe body of the Audi TT marks yet another mile-
stone in the development of modern Audi bodyshells.
Crash safety of the bodyshell is enhanced by means of load-bearing structures at the front end, sides and rear
end, with a heavy emphasis on pedestrian safety.
To ensure efficient volume bodyshell production, various new joining and production techniques are
employed.
The repair concept is based heavily on the well-known aluminium repair concept. However, of course, the
materials combination of aluminium and steel necessitated that new approaches be taken.
