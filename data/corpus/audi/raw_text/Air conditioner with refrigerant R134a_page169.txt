Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
9.2.1 Approved refrigerant oils
Note
♦ The oils used with refrigerant R12 are not suitable for refrig‐
erant R134a.
♦ The name of the compressor manufacturer „Nippondenso“
has been changed to „Denso“.
♦ The refrigerant oil developed specially and exclusively for
R134a refrigerant circuits is not commercially available.
♦ Refrigerant oils specifically designed for each air conditioner
compressor can therefore be obtained from the replacement
parts range ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The use of other refrigerant oils may lead to system failure, as
miscibility and thus also circulation with the refrigerant R134a
(for air conditioner compressor lubrication) cannot always be
guaranteed.
♦ There are different refrigerant oils for „Zexel / Valeo“, „Denso“,
„Delphi“ and „Sanden“ compressors ⇒ Electronic parts cata‐
logue
♦ The logo of the compressor manufacturer „Zexel“ affixed to the
air conditioner compressor was switched as of year of pro‐
duction 2006 (when the manufacturer's name changed) from
„Zexel“ to the new name „Valeo“.
♦ The refrigerant oil (G 052 300 A2) for use in refrigerant circuits
with „Denso“ air conditioner compressors (old name „Nippon‐
denso“) is also included in the retrofit kit (part number 4A0 298
107 A) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ Use is to be made for refrigerant circuits with „Zexel / Valeo“
or „Sanden“ compressor of refrigerant oil with part no. G 052
154 A2 ⇒ Electronic parts cata l o gue .
♦ Use can be made for refrigerant circuits with a „Delphi“ com‐
pressor of refrigerant oil with part no. G 052 154 A2 and
refrigerant oil with part no. G 052 300 A2 ⇒ Electronic parts
catalogue .
♦ For refrigerant circuits with „Zexel / Valeo“ compressors, use
can be made of both the refrigerant oil (G 052 154 A2) and the
refrigerant oil (G 052 200 A2) contained in the retrofit kit (part
no. 4A0 298 107) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
