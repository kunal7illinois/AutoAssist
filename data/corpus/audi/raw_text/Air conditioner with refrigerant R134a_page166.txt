to 11.97
11.97 onwards 800 + 50 • Restrictor coloured (yellow)
Note
♦ Restrictors with a modified hole have been installed at the fac‐
tory since November 1997 (yellow-coloured). The capacity
was increased by 50 g for vehicles with a yellow-coloured re‐
strictor.
♦ In order to distinguish between the different restrictor versions,
the one with the smaller hole is coloured yellow (1.54 mm) or
red (1.42 mm). The restrictor with the larger hole (1.83 mm) is
not coloured.
♦ If a vehicle is fitted with a yellow-coloured restrictor as re‐
placement for a non-coloured restrictor, add 50 g more refrig‐
erant (see table). In addition, the capacity specified on the
label in the vehicle is to be checked and amended if necessary
or the existing label is to be replaced with one indicating the
correct capacity (affix over old label). The red-coloured re‐
strictor is not to be used for these vehicles.
♦ Exclusive use was made at the start of production of „Zexel /
Valeo“ air conditioner compressors. As of Model Year 1996,
production was gradually switched to „Denso“ air conditioner
compressors ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific
workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The logo of the compressor manufacturer „Zexel“ affixed to the
air conditioner compressor was switched as of year of pro‐
duction 2006 (when the manufacturer's name changed) from
„Zexel“ to the new name „Valeo“.
