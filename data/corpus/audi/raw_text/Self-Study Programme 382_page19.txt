Battery
The battery is installed in the boot on the right and
can be accessed by removing the cargo-area floor.
The AudiTTCoupé ´07 does not have a slave start
connector because the battery is directly accessible.
Therefore, battery charging and auxiliary power
supply are via the battery terminals.
For trickle charging of showroom vehicles,
a suitable charger, e.g. VAS 5059A, VAS 5900 or
VAS5903 must be connected in order to conserve
battery power.
If the battery is discharged or faulty, the boot lid can
be released using an emergency release device. For
information on the emergency release device, refer 382_066
to the AudiTTCoupé ´07 Owner's Manual.
The following batteries are used
● 61Ah / 330A
● 72Ah / 380A
● 75Ah / 420A (dry-cell battery for the North
American market)
● 80Ah / 380A
The choice of battery is dependent on
– engine variant
– trim package
– country spec package
