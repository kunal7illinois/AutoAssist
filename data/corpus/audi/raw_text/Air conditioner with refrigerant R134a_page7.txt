Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
Pressure may be given in various units: 1 MPa (megapascal) cor‐
responds to 10 bar gauge pressure or 145 psi; 1 bar absolute
pressure corresponds to 0 bar gauge pressure, which is roughly
equivalent to atmospheric pressure.
For example, the lower the pressure, the lower the temperature
at which water boils.
The vapour pressure curves for water and refrigerant R134a show
for example that, at constant pressure, reducing the temperature
changes vapour to liquid (in the condenser) or that, for instance,
reducing pressure causes the refrigerant to change from the liquid
to the vapour state (in the evaporator).

1.3.3 Vapour pressure table for refrigerant
R134a
The vapour pressure table for every refrigerant is published in
literature for refrigeration system engineers. This table makes it
possible to determine the vapour pressure acting on the column
of liquid in a vessel if the temperature of the vessel is known.
As there is a known characteristic vapour pressure table for every
refrigerant, the type of refrigerant can be identified by way of
pressure and temperature measurement.
