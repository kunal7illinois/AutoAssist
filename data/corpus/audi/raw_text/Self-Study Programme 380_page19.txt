Hybrid gas generators have the task of inflating the airbags with gas.
The airbag control unit J234 activates the igniter in the gas generator. The resultant pulsation wave is directed
to the rupture disc. The rupture disc breaks and the helium from the pressurised gas bottle flows into the
airbag.
