Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
– Detach filler unit from service connection.
– Use absorbent paper, for example, to remove the residual leak
detection additive from the service connection.
– Seal service connection with cap.
– If necessary, use cleaning solution to clean area around serv‐
ice connection.
– Affix sticker next to service connections to indicate that leak
detection fluid has been added to the refrigerant circuit.
– Start up the air conditioner.
Note
♦ The air conditioner must be operated for at least 60 min. to
distribute the additive throughout the refrigerant circuit (the air
conditioner compressor must run). Depending on the extent of
the leak, the leakage location may already become visible un‐
der UV light within this period.
♦ Depending on its magnitude and location, it may now take
several days for sufficient refrigerant oil with additive to
emerge to clearly localise the leakage point.
– Use a UV lamp VAS 6196/4 to locate the refrigerant circuit leak
