Use an unscreened two-wire line -1 and 2- (cross-section 0.35
mm2 or 0.5 mm2) as CAN bus wire.
♦ The CAN bus wires are colour-coded as follows:
CAN bus wire High (powertrain) Orange/black
CAN bus wire High (convenience) Orange/green
CAN bus wire High (infotainment) Orange/purple
CAN bus wire Low (all) Orange/brown
♦ Both CAN bus wires must be of the same length when repair‐
ing.
♦ Whe n twisting the wires -1 and 2-, the twist length specification
-A- = 20 mm must be met.
♦ When making repairs, there must be no untwisted section of
wire which is longer than -B- = 50 mm, e.g. in the vicinity of
crimp connectors -arrow-.
1.6 Repairing FlexRay wiring
Note
♦ Observe general information on repairs to the vehicle electri‐
cal system ⇒ page 72 .
♦ Observe notes on repairing wiring harnesses and connectors
⇒ page 74 including marking repair locations.
FlexRay wiring consists of a sheathed pair of wires -1 and 2- with
a cross-section of 0.35 mm2.
♦ Both wires must be of exactly the same length when repairing.
♦ When twisting the wires -1 and 2-, the twist length specification
-A- = 30 mm must be met.
♦ When making repairs, there must be no untwisted section of
wire which is longer than -B- = 30 mm, e.g. in the vicinity of
crimp connectors -arrow-.
♦ Maximum stripped length of wire = 100 mm.
♦ Protect repair location against environmental effects with suit‐
able measures. This requires a crimp connector with shrink
hose, internal bonding material over untwisted repair joint and
water-tight insulating tape around stripped wire.
1.7 Repairing an 0.25 mm2 wire with a single
crimp connector
Procedure
– Release a length of approx. 20 cm of the defective wire on both
sides of the repair joint.
Caution
Risk of damage to electrical wiring.
♦ Take care when releasing wiring from wrapped wiring har‐
nesses.
