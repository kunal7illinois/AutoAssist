Electrical system and convenience electronics
System behaviour in case of malfunction
A detected system malfunction is indicated to the
driver by activating a rear spoiler warning lamp in
the rev counter. If no fault has occurred, this
indicator lamp comes on for 3 seconds after turning
on the ignition and goes out again.

In the case of the following faults, the rear spoiler is extended for safety reasons:
● The convenience system central control unit J393 receives no road speed signal
● The convenience system central control unit no longer receives any CAN messages
● Implausible signals to rear spoiler adjustment limit switches 1 and 2 are detected
● The convenience system central control unit is supplied with undervoltage (U < 10.5V)
Note
If a fault is detected in the
"electrically adjustable rear spoiler"
function, the ESP can no longer be
switched off manually. If the ESP was
switched off at this time, it is
reactivated automatically.
