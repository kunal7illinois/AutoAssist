Audi TT 2007 ➤
Injection and ignition system (6-cyl. 3.2 ltr. 4-valve injection engine) - Edition 07.2007
– Connect the K-Jetronic tester -V.A.G 1318- with adapters -
V.A.G 1318/11- , -V.A.G 1318/17- and -V.A.G 1318/23- .
– Connect pressure tester to fuel supply hose.
– Connect a fuel-resistant auxiliary hose between fuel rail and
tester.
Note
Use hose clips -arrows- to secure the auxiliary hose.
– Open cut-off valve on pressure tester.
• Lever points in direction of flow.
– Start the engine and run at idling speed.
– Measure the fuel pressure.
• Specification: approx. 4.0 bar
– Switch off ignition.
If specification is not obtained:
– Check fuel pump delivery rate ⇒ Rep. Gr. 20 .
Checking leakage and residual pressure:
– Check leak-tightness and residual pressure by watching the
drop in pressure on the pressure gauge.
• After 10 minutes pressure should still be at least 3.0 bar.
If the residual pressure drops below 3.0 bar:
– Start the engine and run at idling speed.
– Allow pressure to build up, then switch off ignition. At the same
time close cut-off valve of K-Jetronic tester -V.A.G 1318- .
• Lever is at right angle to direction of flow -arrow-.
– Observe pressure drop on pressure gauge.
If the pressure drops again:
– Check pipe connections, injectors and O-rings on fuel rail for
leaks.
– Check pressure gauge for leaks.
If the pressure now does not drop:
– Open cut-off valve on pressure gauge (lever points in direction
of flow).
– Remove rear seat bench ⇒ Rep. Gr. 72 .
