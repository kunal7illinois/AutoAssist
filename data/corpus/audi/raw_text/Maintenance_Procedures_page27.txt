rims), it may not be possible to bring the test pin through the
rim and into contact with the brake disc or pad. If this is the

a flashlight through a hole in wheel).
♦ Determine thickness of the inner pad by visual check (using a

ture from the surrounding air, and must therefore always
be stored in air-tight containers.
