Tyre pressure monitoring system
This system informs the driver of the current tyre pressures by
sending the registered pressure values to the instrument cluster
display via a control unit.
Note
♦ If vehicles with TPM sensors are transported by air freight, the
airline must be notified about the TPM sensors.
♦ The correct version must be used otherwise the tyre pressure
monitoring system will not operate correctly.
For more information about this system, please refer to SSP 219
“Tyre Pressure Monitoring System”.
10.2 Tyre pressure monitoring with wheel
speed sensor
Note
If the tyre pressure monitoring system uses a wheel speed sen‐
sor, wheel electronics are not fitted in the rim.
If the air pressure in a tyre drops, the speed of the wheel changes.
The speed sensor registers the altered wheel speed.
A display in the dash panel insert informs the driver about the tyre
pressure change.
