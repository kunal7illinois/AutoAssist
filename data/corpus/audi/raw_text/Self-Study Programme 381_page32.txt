Audi magnetic ride
Service work
Address
The system can be addressed in the diagnostic
tester under the address: 14 Wheel damping.
Coding
The coding tells the control unit the powertrain type
and engine type of the vehicle. The control unit
accepts the new coding after ignition on/off.
1 = heavy engine (6-cylinder)
3 = lightweight engine (4-cylinder)
3 = coupé with front-wheel drive 381_046
8 = coupé quattro
System initialisation - teaching in the new standard
position
The system initialisation must be performed when
the control unit J250 and/or one or more vehicle
level senders is replaced. The characteristic curves
of the vehicle level sender are stored in the control
unit
During the system initialisation procedure, the con-
trol unit is informed which vehicle ride heights at
the wheel positions match the actual measured val-
ues generated by the vehicle level sender. If these
assignments are known to the control unit, then all
measured values generated subsequently by the
vehicle level sender can be converted to vehicle ride
heights. The basic system initialisation procedure is
identical to the procedure for initialising the aas 381_045
systems in the A6 and A8. The system initialisation
can only be performed when the code control unit is
coded.
