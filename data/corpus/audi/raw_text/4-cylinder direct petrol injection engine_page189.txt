Audi TT 2007 ➤
4-cylinder direct petrol injection engine (2.0 ltr. 4-valve turbo), mechanics - Edition 11.2006
– Secure universal dial gauge bracket -VW 387- to turbocharger
-arrow-.
Note
The dial gauge values (mm) listed here include the 1 mm preload
that is initially set on the gauge.
– Attach dial gauge -VAS 6341/1- with extension, 30 mm -VAS
6341/3- and flat probe -VAS 6341/4- to universal dial gauge
bracket -VW 387- .
– With pressure at 0 bar, set dial gauge -VAS 6341/1- to 1 mm
preload.
– Set scale of dial gauge -VAS 6341/1- to 0.
– Make sure that dial gauge can move freely.
– Operate hand-operated vacuum pump -VAS 6213- until tur‐
bocharger tester -V.A.G 1397A- indicates 350 +/- 5 mbar.
– The dial gauge should now indicate a value between 4.1 mm
and 4.3 mm. If not, turn knurled nut until this value is indicated.
– Hand-tighten lock nut.
– Repeat measurement.
– Vent system via pressure control valve -VAS 6342- so that
pressure reading drops to 0 mbar.
– Set dial gauge -VAS 6341/1- to 0.
Note
The following measurements must be performed in continuous
sequence. Do not allow the pressure to drop to 0 between meas‐
urements.
– Operate hand-operated vacuum pump -VAS 6213- until tur‐
bocharger tester -V.A.G 1397A- indicates 350 +/- 5 mbar.
– Read off and note value indicated on dial gauge -VAS 6341/1- .
– Operate hand-operated vacuum pump -VAS 6213- until tur‐
bocharger tester -V.A.G 1397A- indicates 650 to 700 mbar.
– Vent system via pressure control valve -VAS 6342- so that
pressure reading drops to 350 +/- 5 mbar.
– Read off and note value indicated on dial gauge -VAS 6341/1- .
– Add values 1 and 2 together and divide by 2.
– The result (mean value) should be 5 +/- 0.25 mm.
– If the result (mean value) is not 5 +/- 0.25 mm, correct the
setting accordingly, tighten the lock nut hand-tight and repeat
the measurement.
– If the result (mean value) is 5 +/- 0.25 mm, tighten the lock nut
and secure with sealing paint. For sealing paint refer to ⇒
