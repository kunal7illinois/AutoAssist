Brake system
Rear axle wheel brake
The brake calipers are identical in design and princi-
ple of operation to those on the Audi A3. The brake
carriers have been modified since the Audi TT has
wider rims than the Audi A3 and, because of this,
the requisite clearance for the handbrake cable
would not have been assured had the A3 brake car-
rier been adopted unchanged.

16" wheel brake
Compared to the Audi A3, the brake calipers have
been shifted 10 mm further inwards. Two new 16"
and 17" splash plates are used. The brake hoses
have been modified. In the Audi TT the transition
point from brake hose to brake line is located on the
side member (it is located on the subframe in the
Audi A3) .
