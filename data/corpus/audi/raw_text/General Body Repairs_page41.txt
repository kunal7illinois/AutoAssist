10.1 Repairing windscreens
As a cost-saving alternative to windscreen replacement, it is pos‐
sible under certain circumstances to repair windscreens dam‐
aged by stone chipping.
Tinted windows, windows with a coloured sun strip or insulated
glass (Audi A8, A6) can also be repaired, as the tinting is provided
by a coloured film layer in the window glass.
Windscreen repair is to be given preference over windscreen re‐
placement if the following requirements are met.
10.2 Requirements
• Damaged area must not be within direct field of long-distance
vision -1-. This field corresponds to a roughly 29 cm wide strip
(A4 landscape format) centrally positioned in the driver's direct
line of vision in the direction of travel and extending to the top
and bottom of the wiping area.
• The cracks radiating from the damaged area -2- must not be
longer than 50 mm and must not run outwards to the edge.
• Diameter of impact point -1- must not exceed 5 mm.
• Coloured film -2- or inner glass -3- must not be damaged.
• There must be no dirt or moisture in lower area of cracks.
• Therefore the time elapsed since the damage occurred must
not be too long.
The following types of damage can be repaired, however the
damaged area must NOT be not located in the field of long-range
