1 Safety precautions and rules for
cleanliness
1.1 General notes on self-diagnosis
♦ The engine control unit has a self-diagnosis capability. Before
carrying out repairs and fault finding, the fault memory must
be interrogated. The vacuum hoses and connections must al‐
so be checked (unmetered air).
♦ Fuel hoses in engine compartment must only be secured with
spring-type clips. O- t ype clips or screw-type clips must not be
used.
♦ A voltage of at least 11.5 V is required for proper operation of
the electrical components.
♦ Do not use sealants containing silicone. Particles of silicone
drawn into the engine will not be burnt in the engine and will
damage the Lambda probes.
♦ The vehicles are fitted with a crash/fuel shut-off system. This
system is designed to reduce the risk of a vehicle fire after a
crash by deactivating the fuel pump via the fuel pump control
unit.
