chorage points following an accident
♦ Latch plate deformed (strained)
♦ Height adjustment not functioning
♦ Anchorage points (seat, pillar, vehicle floor) deformed or
thread damaged
• If you identify any damage on these parts, renew complete
seat belt including belt buckle.

additional child seats (not for driver's
seat belt) - country-specific version
To check this function fit the complete belt assembly (including
side panel trim).
Activating locking function of retractor mechanism:
♦ Pull out belt as far as it will go.
Correct function:
♦ The belt should retract with an audible clicking sound.
♦ Once you stop the belt retracting any further, it should no lon‐
ger be possible to pull the belt out.
Deactivating
♦ Allow the belt to retract as far as the last approx. 100 mm.
♦ The locking function of the retractor mechanism should be de‐

again.

seat belt must be renewed.
