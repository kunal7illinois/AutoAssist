– Run engine at idling speed for several minutes (do not press
accelerator) and then switch off. Fuel system will bleed itself
automatically.
– Check the entire fuel system for leaks.
Renew affected component if leakage still occurs after tightening
to correct torque.
– After completing the repair, road-test the vehicle. Accelerate
with full throttle at least once. Then check the high-pressure
section of the fuel system again for leaks.
Note
If there is any air left in the fuel system, the engine may switch to
the backup mode ('emergency running' mode) during the road
test. Switch off the engine and erase the fault memory. Then con‐
tinue the road test.
