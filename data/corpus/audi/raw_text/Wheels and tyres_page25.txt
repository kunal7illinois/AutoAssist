1) Tyre pressure monitoring (TPM): direct measurement. Wheel electronics fitted
at metal valve on wheel; values for pressure and temperature periodically trans‐
mitted to vehicle and evaluated.
2) Tyre monitor display (TMD+): indirect measurement. No electronic components
installed in wheel. Rolling circumference and vibration characteristics of the indi‐
vidual wheels are compared by analysing signals from ABS sensors. A loss of tyre
pressure is diagnosed indirectly. The speed and vibration characteristics of the
wheel change in the event of a drop in the inflation pressure.
3) Tyre monitor display (TMD): indirect measurement. No electronic components
installed in wheel. Rolling circumference of the individual wheels is compared by
analysing signals from ABS sensors. A loss of tyre pressure is diagnosed indi‐
rectly. The speed of the wheel changes in the event of a drop in the inflation
pressure.
