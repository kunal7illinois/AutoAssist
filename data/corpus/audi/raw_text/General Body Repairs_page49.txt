13 Contact corrosion
Contact corrosion can occur if unsuitable fasteners are used on
the vehicle (bolts, nuts, washers etc.).
For this reason, only fasteners with a special surface coating have
been fitted on the vehicle.
In addition, all rubber and plastic parts and all adhesives are made
of non-conductive materials.
Always renew parts if you are in any doubt as to whether the old
part can be used again.
Note
Please note the following:
Always use genuine replacement parts (same as original equip‐
ment). These have been tested and are aluminium-compatible.
Accessories must be approved by A U DI AG.
Damage caused by contact corrosion is not covered by the war‐
ranty.
