1.14 Basic rules for working on refrigerant cir‐
cuit
♦ General notes ⇒ page 14
♦ Cleaning refrigerant circuit ⇒ page 14 .
♦ Additionally for vehicles with air conditioner compressor with
no magnetic clutch (with air conditioner compressor regulating
valve -N280- ) ⇒ page 15
♦ O-rings ⇒ page 15
1.14.1 General notes
• Heed the workplace-specific instructions ⇒ Audi-ServiceNet,
HSO Environmental Protection .
• Ensure absolute cleanliness when working.
• Wear safety goggles and gloves when working with refrigerant
and nitrogen.
• Switch on workshop extraction systems, if available.
• Always use air conditioner service station to discharge refrig‐
erant circuit, then unfasten screw connections and renew
defective components.
• Use caps to seal off opened assemblies and hoses to prevent
the ingress of moisture and dirt.
• Use only tools and materials intended for refrigerant R134a.
• Seal opened refrigerant oil containers to protect against mois‐
ture.
Note
♦ After completing service work, screw sealing caps (with seals)
onto all connections with valves and service connections.
♦ Before starting up the air conditioning system, heed the vehi‐
cle-specific capacities ⇒ page 144 .
♦ Do not top up refrigerant in circuit; discharge existing refriger‐
ant and re-charge system.
1.14.2 Cleaning refrigerant circuit
The refrigerant circuit must be flushed out with refrigerant R134a
⇒ page 59 (or blown out with compressed air and nitrogen
⇒ page 55 ) in the following cases:
– If moisture or dirt has ingressed into the refrigerant circuit (e.g.
following an accident).
– If the refrigerant oil is dark and viscous.
– If there is too much refrigerant oil in the refrigerant circuit after
compressor replacement.
– If the air conditioner compressor has to be replaced on ac‐
count of „internal“ damage (e.g. noise or no output).
