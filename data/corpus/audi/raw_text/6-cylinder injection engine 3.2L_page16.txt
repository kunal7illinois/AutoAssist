4.7 Installing radiators, condensers and
charge air coolers
Even when the radiator, condenser and charge air cooler are cor‐
rectly installed, slight impressions may be visible on the fins of
these components. This does not mean that the components are
damaged. If the fins are only very slightly distorted, this does not
justify renewal of the radiator, condenser or charge air cooler.
