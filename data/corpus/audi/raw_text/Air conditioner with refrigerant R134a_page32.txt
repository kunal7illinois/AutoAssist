Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Connection with low-pressure valve
1 - Connection with external thread and groove for O-ring (sol‐
dered in)
2 - O-ring (version and identification: black or coloured ⇒ Elec‐
tronic parts catalogue )
3 - Valve with internal thread
4 - Seal for sealing cap
5 - Sealing cap
Note
♦ Carefully screw the handwheel of the service coupling into the
quick-release coupling adapter to the extent required to relia‐
bly open the valve in the service connection (observe the
pressure gauge; take care not to open the valve too far).
♦ To remove and install the valve -3- with the refrigerant circuit
drained, make use of an adapter from the socket -T10364- for
example.
♦ There are different versions of these valves (with internal or
external thread) and the tightening torques may therefore also
differ. The tightening torque for the valves -3- used at present
with an M10 x 1.25 mm internal thread is 9 Nm +- 1 Nm.
♦ There are different versions of these valves and the corre‐
sponding sealing caps. Attention is to be paid to the correct
version of the valve and correct assignment of the sealing cap
