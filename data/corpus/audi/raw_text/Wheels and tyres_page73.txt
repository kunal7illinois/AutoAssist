The pressure sensor transmits the recorded signals to the aerial
of the tyre pressure monitoring system.
The pressure sensor is secured to the wheel via a bolt connection.
The tyre pressure monitor display in the dash panel insert warns
the driver if the pressure sensor detects a drop in tyre pressure.
