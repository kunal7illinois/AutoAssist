The engine number (including “Engine code” and “Serial num‐

gearbox.
The engine code is also stamped on the right of the cylinder head
and on the cylinder block.
The engine number consists of up to nine characters (alphanu‐
meric). The first part (up to 3 code letters) represents the “engine
code letters”, the second part (6 digits) the “serial number”. If more
than 999 999 engines were produced with the same code letters,
the first of the 6 digits is replaced by a letter.
Additionally there is a sticker on the toothed belt cover showing
the “engine code” and “serial number”.
The engine code is also to be found on the vehicle data sticker.
