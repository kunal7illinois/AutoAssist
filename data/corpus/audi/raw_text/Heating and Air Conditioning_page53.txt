Audi TT 2007 ➤
Heating and Air Conditioning - Edition 04.2009
– In “Auto” and “AC on” mode (lamps in buttons light) and with
temperature set to “cold” stop (maximum cooling output),
square-wave signal with a pulse width -A- between 75 % and
100 % (the regulating valve is actuated).
Note
♦ The illustration shows a signal with a signal ratio of approx. 80
%.
♦ The pulse width -A- is governed by the required cooling output,
the electrical system voltage etc. (over the width of area -A-,
the current is controlled via the air conditioner compressor
regulating valve -N280- by the air conditioner operating unit,
Climatronic control unit -J255- ).
♦ The signal distance -B- is always 2 milliseconds (correspond‐
ing to a frequency of 500 hertz).
♦ The duty cycle is derived from the ratio of pulse width -A- to
signal distance -B-.
– The setting on the air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic
control unit -J255- and the measured ambient influences gov‐
ern the pulse width of the square-wave signal (signal ratio
between 100 % and greater than 30 %, the regulating valve is
actuated such that the compressor output required to obtain
the specified temperatures is achieved).
Note
♦ In “Auto” and “AC on” mode (lamps in buttons light) and with
temperature set to “cold” stop, the air conditioner compressor
regulating valve -N280- is actuated such that the maximum
permissible current of approx. 0.65 A flows via the air condi‐
tioner compressor regulating valve -N280- (maximum com‐
pressor output).
♦ In control mode, the actuation time is governed by the required
cooling output and the vehicle electrical system voltage, for
example. It is however always of sufficient duration to achieve
a mean current of 0.3 A.
