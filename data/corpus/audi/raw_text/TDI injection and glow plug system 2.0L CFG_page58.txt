Installing
• Tightening torques
⇒ “8.1 Injectors - exploded view”, page 31
Note
♦ The fuel pressure sender -G247- does not have a seal; in‐
stead, it has a deformable sealing lip.
♦ Check that sealing surfaces (deformable sealing lip) and
threads on fuel pressure sender -G247- are not damaged. If
inspection of fuel pressure sender -G247- shows that it is OK,
it can be used again.
♦ Also check sealing surface at opening in fuel rail.
♦ The beginning of the thread and the deformable sealing lip of
the fuel pressure regulating valve -N276- must be coated with
diesel fuel.
– Screw in fuel pressure sender -G247- by hand.
– Then tighten fuel pressure sender -G247- to specified torque.
– After installing fuel pressure sender -G247- , leave engine
running at moderate speed for a few minutes when bleeding
fuel system and then switch off again.
Note
The fuel system is “self-bleeding”; do NOT open the high-pres‐
sure connections.
– Interrogate event memory and erase it if necessary.
– Switch off ignition.
– Carefully check the entire fuel system for leaks.
– Renew affected component if leakage still occurs after tight‐
ening to correct torque.
– After completing the repair, road-test the vehicle. Accelerate
with full throttle at least once. Then check the high-pressure
section of the fuel system again for leaks.
Note
If there is any air left in the fuel system, the engine may switch to
the backup mode ('emergency running' mode) during the road
test. Switch off the engine and erase the event memory. Then
continue the road test.
– After road test, interrogate event memory again.
