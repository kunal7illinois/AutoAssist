Checking piston
– Using a micrometer (75 ... 100 mm), measure approx. 10 mm
from the lower edge, perpendicular to the piston pin axis.
• Maximum deviation from nominal dimension: 0.04 mm.
Nominal dimension
⇒ „4.2 Piston and cylinder dimensions“, page 77 .
Checking cylinder bore
– Use an internal dial gauge -VAS 6078- to take measurements
at 3 points in transverse direction -A- and in longitudinal di‐
rection -B-.
• Maximum deviation from nominal dimension: 0.08 mm.
Nominal dimension
⇒ „4.2 Piston and cylinder dimensions“, page 77 .
Installation position of bearing shells in conrods
– Insert bearing shells centrally in conrod/conrod bearing cap.
• Distance -a- = approx. 1.5 mm.
Separating parts of new conrod
It is possible that the two parts of a new conrod are not completely
separated as intended. If it is not possible to take off the conrod
bearing cap by hand, proceed as follows:
– To avoid any risk of damage, the conrod should only be clam‐
ped lightly in a vice using jaw covers as shown in illustration.
• The conrod is clamped in position below the do t ted line.
– Unscrew bolts -arrows- approx. 5 turns.
