4.7 Airbag
WARNING
Scrapping airbag units which have not been ignited poses a
safety risk.
Disposal of pyrotechnic components
Non-ignited pyrotechnic components
Non-ignited pyrotechnic components (e.g. airbags, seat belts, py‐
rotechnic battery circuit breakers) must be disposed of in original
packaging and in accordance with national regulations.
Please contact your importer or regional office if you require fur‐
ther information.
Pyrotechnic components
Pyrotechnic components ignited in an accident can be disposed
of together with commercial refuse.
WARNING
This does not apply to belt tensioners which are Wankel-pow‐
ered. These must be disposed of in the same way as non-
ignited pyrotechnic components (e.g. airbags, seat belts,
pyrotechnic battery circuit breakers). Reason: The workshop
does not have the means to check whether the Wankel-pow‐
ered belt tensioners have ignited fully (in all ignition stages).
