Specified value: 1.5 Ω Max.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Check the wiring connection for short to ground, high resist‐
ance or an open circuit.
– Check the wiring connection for damage, corrosion, loose or
broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is found in the wiring and the Terminal Resist‐
ance was Not OK:
– Replace the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- . Refer to
the Repair Manual.
If no malfunction is found in the wiring and the Terminal Resist‐
ance was OK:
– Replace the Data Bus On Board Diagnostic Interface -J533- .
Final procedures
After the repair work, the following work steps must be performed
in the following sequence:
1 - Check the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Memory”,
page 14 .
2 - If necessary, erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
3 - If the DTC memory was erased, generate readiness code.
Refer to ⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
