Audi TT 2007 ➤
TDI injection and glow plug system (4-cyl. 2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail) - Edition 03.2010
8 Injectors
8.1 Checking injectors (piezo injectors)
There are three different tests for checking the operation of the
injectors.
• Checking adaption of “Injector delivery calibration values” and
“Injector voltage calibration values” ⇒ page 35
• Checking return flow rate of injectors with engine running
⇒ page 35
• Checking return flow rate of injectors at starter cranking speed
⇒ page 38
8.2 Adaption of injector delivery calibration
values and injector voltage calibration
values
The “Injector delivery calibration” and “Injector voltage calibration”
functions serve to correct the injection rates for each cylinder of
a common rail system individually across the entire operating
range.
The 7-digit adaption values -1- (details in illustration are only an
example) are marked separately on each injector. They may con‐
sist of letters and/or numbers (ASCII code).
Reference table for reading out letters and/or numbers on each
injector
When a new injector is installed, the adaption value for the new
injector must be written into the engine control unit.
When the engine control unit is renewed, the appropriate “injector
delivery calibration” values with “injector voltage calibration” val‐
ues must be written into the new control unit.
Additionally, check that the “injector delivery calibration values”
with “injector voltage calibration values” are correctly entered for
all the other injectors. Do NOT attempt to re-enter these calibra‐
tion values if the correct values are already stored in the engine
control unit.
The adaption procedure is described in the Guided Fault Finding.
(The procedure is also described under Guided Functions)
