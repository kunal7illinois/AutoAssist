– Using a commercially available connection piece, connect
charge air system tester -V.A.G 1687- to compressed air -1-.
Note
If there is water in sight glass, remove drain plug -6- and drain
water.
– Open valve -3-.
Caution
Risk of damage if pressure is set too high.
♦ The pressure must not exceed 0.5 bar.
– Adjust pressure to 0.5 bar via pressure control valve -2-.
– Open valve -4- and wait until test system is pressurised. If
necessary, adjust pressure to 0.5 bar again.
– Check charge air system for audible leaks or leaks that can be
felt with the hand; apply commercially available leak detecting
spray or use ultrasonic tester -V.A.G 1842- .
Note
♦ A small amount of air escapes through the valves and enters
the engine. Therefore it is not possible to perform a pressure
retention test.
♦ For operation of ultrasonic tester -V.A.G 1842- , refer to ⇒
Operating instructions .
♦ Release pressure in test circuit by detaching hose coupling
from adapter before removing adapter.
♦ Hose connections and air pipes and hoses must be free of oil
and grease before assembly.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct type of hose clips
(same as original equipment) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ To ensure that the air hoses can be properly secured at their
connections, spray rust remover onto the worm thread of used
hose clips before installing.
