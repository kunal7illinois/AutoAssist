Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
Run-flat tyres must only be fitted on wheels with extended hump
(EH2).
Note the special installation instructions.
It is not permitted to fit both run-flat tyres and standard tyres on
the same vehicle, even on separate axles.
A standard tyre can be fitted only in exceptional circumstances
for a brief period and limited distance. The driver must be ex‐
pressly informed that the run-flat characteristics do not apply in
this case.
