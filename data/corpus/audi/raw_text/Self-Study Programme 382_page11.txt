Function diagram Wake-up line
The function diagram is identical to that of data bus
diagnostic interface as featured on the AudiA3´04.
The dash panel insert J285 and the data bus
diagnostic interface J533 can wake each other from
idle via the bidirectional wake-up line. The dash
panel insert CAN between the dash panel insert and
the data bus diagnostic interface is a highspeed
CAN and, unlike the convenience CAN bus, is not
wake-up capable via the CAN line.
Onboard voltage is applied to the wake-up line
when terminal 15 is "on".
This wake-up function is required to wake up the
dash panel insert CAN without "terminal 15 on" after
the CAN bus has been in idle state.
For example, to be able to display date, time and
mileage in the dash panel insert after opening the
driver's door, but before turning on the ignition.
