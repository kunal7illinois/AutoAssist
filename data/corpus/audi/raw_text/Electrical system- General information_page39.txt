♦ Hand-held multimeter -V.A.G 1526E-
Procedure
– Always observe the following; otherwise correct measurement
is not guaranteed.
• Leave battery in vehicle; do not disconnect earth cable.
• Open bonnet or rear lid and fix lock in „Locked“ position to stop
luggage compartment light coming on.
• Use central locking system to lock vehicle.
• Battery must NOT be subjected to electrical load within the
next 2 hours prior to measurement.
• Battery must NOT be charged in the 12 hours prior to meas‐
urement.
• Battery temperature must be at least –10 °C.
– Perform preparations for no-load voltage measurement ⇒
Electrical system; Rep. gr. 27 .
After a waiting time of at least 2 hours:
– Connect hand-held multimeter -V.A.G 1526E- between bat‐
tery terminal clamps or to remote positive terminal „+“ and to
remote earth terminal „–“.
– Measure voltage between battery terminal clamps.
• Specification: 12.5 V or above = battery is OK
– If battery no-load voltage is below 12.5 V, battery must be re-
charged ⇒ page 35 .
– Current draw must be measured after a charging period of
5 minutes ⇒ page 30 .
– If battery no-load voltage is 11.6 V or less, battery is totally
discharged ⇒ page 38 .
5.4 Measuring no-load voltage - vehicles
with battery monitor control unit -J367-
or energy management control unit -
J644- „transport mode active“
Note
As part of the specified care and maintenance work for vehicles
not in use or in storage, the state of charge in % (SOC) can be
read off the trip recorder with the transport mode active. This
shows whether the battery needs charging ⇒ Maintenance ta‐
