Occupant protection
Occupant protection system in the Audi TT Coupé ‘07
The Audi TT Coupé ‘07 is a high-end sports car. However, the occupant protection system matches the
vehicle's driving dynamics in every respect. Creating a sports car with a high occupant protection potential is
always a big challenge. This challenge was met by the TT Coupé development team.
The occupant protection system of the Audi TT Coupé ‘07 is composed of the following components and
systems:
– Airbag control unit
– Dual-stage driver and front passenger airbags
– Front side airbags
– Central crash sensor for front airbag, so-called "upfront" sensor for head-on collision detection
– Side impact detection sensors in the front doors
– Front belt tensioners
– Battery isolation igniter
– Belt switch, driver side
– Belt-on indicator
Due to the different criteria and statutory requirements set by the various markets, the equipment
specifications can vary. This applies particularly to the US market.
