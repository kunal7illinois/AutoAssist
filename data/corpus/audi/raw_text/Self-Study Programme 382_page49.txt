BOSE Surround Sound
In the Audi TT Coupé ’07, a BOSE surround sound system is optional in combination with the concert and
symphony radios as well as Audi navigation systems. The sound system features BOSE 6000 amplifier
technology with 8-channel DSP amplifier and Audio Pilot which set new standards for this automobile class.
The amplifier drives a total of 12 loudspeakers. It was adapted specially for use in the TT Coupé.
Compared with the standard sound system, a three-way system and an additional subwoofer are installed in
the left-hand side trim of the rear seat bench. As with other current BOSE sound systems - a microphone is
integrated in the overhead module to record background noise. The DSP amplifier utilises the background
noise information picked up by the microphone to frequency-adjust the output signals to the loudspeakers,
resulting in a well-balanced sound.
All loudspeakers are diagnosed via the amplifier, i.e. via address word 47. Vehicle model, equipment,
networking and type of driving noise compensation are also coded in the amplifier.
