Note
♦ A second mechanic is required for removal of the cylinder
head.
♦ The toothed belt tensioning roller is detached from the stud
when the cylinder head is lifted out.
♦ The oil return line from the turbocharger is pulled out of the
support when the cylinder head is lifted out.
– Lift cylinder head at gearbox end first and guide out of toothed
belt cover. Make sure toothed belt tensioning roller does not
drop out.
– Take care to place cylinder head down without bending oil re‐
turn line. If necessary, place a block of wood below exhaust
manifold.
Caution
Risk of damage to glow plugs when putting down cylinder
head.
♦ After removal, the cylinder head must not be put down on
the gasket side with the glow plugs still installed, because
the glow plugs project slightly beyond the gasket surface.
