3.5.34 Secondary Air Injection Solenoid Valve,
Checking
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Multimeter.
♦ Wiring diagram.
Test requirements
• The Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Solenoid Valve --N112--
fuse OK.
• The Engine Control Module (ECM) Power Supply Relay -
J271- and the Fuel Pump Relay -J17- fuse OK.
• Battery voltage at least 12.5 V.
• All electrical consumers switched off (radiator fan must NOT
run during test).
• A/C switched off.
• The ignition switched OFF.
Test procedure
– Perform a preliminary check to verify the customers complaint.
Refer to ⇒ “3.1 Preliminary Check”, page 8 .
Start diagnosis
Note
Voltage is supplied to the Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Solenoid
Valve --N112-- from the Engine Control Module (ECM) Power
Supply Relay -J271- on early models, or the Fuel Pump Relay -
J17- on later models. Refer to Wiring Diagrams for circuit/pin
locations.
Procedure
– Disconnect the Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Solenoid Valve
--N112-- electrical harness connector.
Checking internal resistance
– Using a multimeter, check the Secondary Air Injection (SAI)
Solenoid Valve --N112-- terminals 1 to 2 for resistance.
Specified value: 3.5 - 8.5 Ω (at approx. 20° C)
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Replace the Secondary Air Injection (SAI) Solenoid Valve --
N112-- .
If the specified value was obtained:
Checking voltage supply
Start the engine.
– Using a multimeter, check the Secondary Air Injection (SAI)
Solenoid Valve --N112-- electrical connector terminal 1 to
Ground for voltage.
Specified value: Battery voltage.
Switch the ignition OFF.
