19 Surface treatment
On account of the low specific gravity, aluminium dust and shav‐
ings do not immediately fall to the ground but remain in the air for
quite a while.
Always use an extractor when performing surface treatment and
cutting operations.
Only use stainless steel wire brushes.
Rough-filing discs must not be used because of the smear effect.
Use grinding discs of grit size P 80 to P 200.
Only use grinding discs, drill bits, millers and cutting disks in con‐
junction with cleaning block DA 009 802.
Commercially available abrasives for aluminium can be used
without the cleaning block.
Clean surface with paint thinner.
WARNING
Use tools either for steel or aluminium.
