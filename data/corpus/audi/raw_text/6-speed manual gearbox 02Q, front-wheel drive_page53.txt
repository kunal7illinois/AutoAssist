tween the two notches -arrows B-.

plate, the pressure plate and clutch plate must not be installed.
• The position of the adjuster ring can be outside the notches
on used clutches.

stallation (causes clutch grab when driving off), always adhere to
the following procedure when installing the pressure plate:
– Screw in all 6 bolts evenly by hand until bolt heads make con‐
tact with pressure plate.
– Working clockwise, tighten all six bolts consecutively in steps
of 90° (1/4 turn) until the housing makes contact with the fly‐
wheel.

tively. Tightening torque ⇒ Item 4 (page 45)
