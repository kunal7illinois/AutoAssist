1) 1 - The pressure in a refrigerant circuit with a regulating air conditioner compressor is maintained at approx. 2 bar absolute (corresponding
to approx. 1 bar gauge) despite varying heat transfer and fluctuating engine speeds. This however only applies within the output range of
the air conditioner compressor. If the output limits of the air conditioner compressor are exceeded, the pressure will increase
⇒ page 103 .
2) 2 - The temperature in a refrigerant circuit with a regulating air conditioner compressor is maintained within the regulating range of the
air conditioner compressor despite varying heat transfer and fluctuating engine speeds. This however only applies within the output range
of the air conditioner compressor. If the output limits of the air conditioner compressor are exceeded, the temperature will increase

Note
♦ Non self-regulating air conditioner compressors are switched
off by the relevant control unit via the air conditioner compres‐
sor regulating valve -N280- at evaporator temperatures below
0 °C.
♦ On vehicles with air conditioner compressor regulating valve -
N280- the pressure on the low pressure end is altered by
actuating the valve.
♦ On vehicles with two evaporators and two expansion valves,
the temperature and the pressure in the refrigerant circuit cor‐
respond to those on vehicles with only one evaporator and one
expansion valve (parallel connection).
♦ Depending on the design of the refrigerant circuit, a compo‐
nent with an internal heat exchanger may be fitted (e.g. on the
Audi A4 2008 > and the Audi A5 Coupé 2008 > a refrigerant
pipe with an internal heat exchanger). In the internal heat ex‐
changer, the hot refrigerant (liquid) flowing through the high-
pressure side gives off energy to the cold refrigerant (gaseous
or vaporous) flowing through the low-pressure side, thus en‐
hancing the efficiency of the air conditioner ⇒ page 22 .
