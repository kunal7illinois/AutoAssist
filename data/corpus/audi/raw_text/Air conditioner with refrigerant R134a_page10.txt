Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
♦ Charge factor ⇒ page 7
♦ Tracing leaks ⇒ page 7
1.5.1 Trade names and designations
The refrigerant R134a is currently available under the following
trade names:
♦ H-FKW 134a
♦ SUVA 134a
♦ KLEA 134a
Note
♦ Different trade names may be used in other countries.
♦ Of the wide range of refrigerants available, this is the only one
which may be used for vehicles. The designations Frigen and
Freon are trade names. They also apply to refrigerants which
should not be used in vehicles.
1.5.2 Colour
Like water, refrigerants are colourless in both vapour and liquid
form. Gas is invisible. Only the boundary layer between gas and
liquid is visible (liquid level in indicator tube of charging cylinder
or bubbles in sight glass). Liquid refrigerant R134a may have a
coloured (milky) appearance in a sight glass. This cloudiness is
caused by partially dissolved refrigerant oil and does not indicate
a fault.
1.5.3 Vapour pressure
In a partially filled, closed vessel, the quantity of refrigerant evap‐
orating from the surface equals the quantity returning to the liquid
state as vapour particles condense. This state of equilibrium oc‐
curs under the influence of pressure and is often called vapour
pressure. Vapour pressure is dependent on temperature
⇒ page 3 „Vapour pressure table“.
1.5.4 Physical properties of R134a
As the vapour pressure curves of R134a and other refrigerants
are sometimes very similar, unequivocal identification cannot be
made simply on the basis of pressure.
When using R134a, the air conditioner compressor is lubricated
by means of special synthetic refrigerant oils, e.g. PAG oils (pol‐
yalkylene glycol oils).
1.5.5 Reaction with metals
In its pure state, refrigerant R134a is chemically stable and does
not corrode iron or aluminium.
However, contamination of the refrigerant, e.g. with chlorine com‐
pounds, leads to the corrosion of certain metals and plastics. This
can result in blockage, leaks or deposits at the air conditioner
compressor piston.
1.5.6 Critical temperature/critical pressure
The refrigerant R134a remains chemically stable up to a gas
pressure of 39.5 bar (corresponding to a temperature of 101 °C).
Above this temperature, the refrigerant decomposes (refer to
"Combustibility").
