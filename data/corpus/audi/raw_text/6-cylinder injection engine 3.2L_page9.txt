3 Safety precautions
When working on the fuel system note the following warnings:
WARNING
The fuel system operates at extremely high pressure. This can
cause injury.
♦ The fuel pressure in the high-pressure section of the in‐
jection system must be reduced to a residual pressure
prior to opening the system.
♦ Wrap a clean cloth around the connection and carefully
loosen the connection to allow the residual pressure to
dissipate.
– Procedure before opening high-pressure section of injection
system ⇒ page 4 .
WARNING
Escaping fuel can cause a fire risk.
♦ The power supply for the fuel pump control unit -J538-
must be disconnected before opening the fuel system, as
the fuel system pressurisation pump -G6- will be activated
briefly when the driver's door is opened with the battery
still connected.
Caution
To prevent damage to the electronic components when dis‐
connecting the battery:
♦ Observe notes on procedure for disconnecting the battery.
♦ Always switch off the ignition before disconnecting the
battery.
– Disconnect battery ⇒ Rep. Gr. 27 .
3.1 Observe the following to prevent injuries
to persons and damage to the injection
and ignition system:
Observe the following to prevent injuries to persons and damage
to the injection and ignition system:
♦ Do not touch or disconnect ignition coils with output stages
when the engine is running or being turned at starter speed.
♦ Always switch off the ignition before connecting or discon‐
necting electrical wiring for the injection or ignition system or
tester cables.
♦ If you want to crank the engine at starting speed without ac‐

nectors from the ignition coils and the injectors. After
completing the work, interrogate and erase the fault memory.
