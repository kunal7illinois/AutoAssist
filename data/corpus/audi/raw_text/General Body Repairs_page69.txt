Punch rivets (self-piercing rivets)
– Start by performing separating cuts where necessary.
– Use riveting tool to press out punch rivet. Insert tip of press
tool in stamped area of panel.
Note
Set riveting tool to material thickness for all operations. Roughly
cut out damaged part if flange is not accessible with riveting tool.
WARNING
Punch rivets must not be drilled out or ground down.
Pressing out creates a hole in the inner panel and the punch rivet
remains in the outer panel.
Different inserts must be used for the various rivet sizes.
– Use chisel to cut bonded joint and detach part.
– If panel is undamaged, re-form flange with riveting tool.
– Match up new parts and fit solid or pop rivets as specified in
Workshop Manual.
Note
Punch rivets are made of steel and have a special coating. If
grinding produces sparks, this is an indication that there are rem‐
nants of the old punch rivet. Remove punch rivet remnants and
change grinding disc.
Note
If punch rivet is not accessible using riveting tool, you can use a
nickel-plated spot weld cutter with spring-mounted tip (e.g. Hazet
1967) to drill off the aluminium around the rivet.
Should punch rivets drop into the interior of the vehicle they must
be removed. A magnet can be used for this purpose.
