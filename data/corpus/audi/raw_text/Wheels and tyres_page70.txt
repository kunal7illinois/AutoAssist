In the end, the tyre is usually destroyed completely.
The cause for the slow pressure loss cannot always be deter‐
mined because the tyre is severely damaged and structural com‐
ponents of the tyre are missing.
The following illustrations show tyres which were destroyed by
driving with insufficient inflation pressure.
8.15 Temperature increase caused by insuf‐
ficient inflation pressure
The graph shows the temperature changes for a tyre in operation
at a speed of 180 km/h.
A - Normal range. When the specified tyre pressure is adhered
to, the temperature will remain stable.
B - Danger zone. When tyre pressure is 0.3 bar below specifica‐
tion, the temperature rises to above 120° C at high speeds.
C - Critical temperature threshold. A tyre defect will develop.
T - Temperature
t - Travel time in minutes
8.16 Tears in tyre
Use for tears in tyre, lost patches of tread or burst tyres.
Damage caused by external forces is not covered by the warran‐
ty.
