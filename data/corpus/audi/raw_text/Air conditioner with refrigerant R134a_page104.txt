Note
On vehicles with no or an inaccessible connection at the air con‐
ditioner compressor, remove the low-pressure switch for air con‐
ditioning system -F73- (jumper the contacts in the connector for
the low-pressure switch for air conditioning system -F73- ) and
screw an adapter to this connection ⇒ Heating, air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific
workshop manual).
Note
♦ The tools listed below are commercially available or can be
obtained from the regional sales centre or importer.
♦ Should it be necessary to measure pressures at switch con‐
nections on high-pressure side, use adapter from adapter set
for refrigerant circuit -V.A.G 1785/9- and proceed in the same
manner.

6.2.1 Connecting air conditioner service sta‐
tion to refrigerant circuit with adapter set
for refrigerant circuit -V.A.G 1786-
A - Connection with valve (small valve core) at low-pressure side
of refrigerant circuit
B - Adapter with union nut -V.A.G 1786/1-
C - Commercially available filler hose (short version with 5/8"
thread on each end)
D - Adapter with service connection -V.A.G 1786/2- (for connec‐
tion of quick-release coupling of air conditioner service station
-E-)
Note
♦ Assemble adapter and filler hose as shown and start by con‐
necting to connection with valve -A-.
♦ The adapter with union nut -V.A.G 1786/1- is only to be used
at connections with a „small“ valve insert (standard for con‐
nection with valve for low-pressure switch for air conditioning
system -F73- and also gradually introduced as of 10.94 at the
air conditioner compressor).
♦ Instead of adapter with union nut -V.A.G 1786/1- , you can also
use adapter -V.A.G 1785/10- (remove valve from adapter -
V.A.G 1785/10- or install valve opener in filler hose).
