– Loosen cap nut and remove wiring lug from screw connection.
– Check wiring lug for corrosion, dirt, etc.
– Select appropriate adapter and corresponding sanding pad.
Note
As an alternative you can also use the sanding block.
Caution
Increased corrosion due to exposed copper layer.
♦ Do not sand away the tin plating to such an extent that the
copper layer underneath becomes visible. Galvanic ef‐
fects can cause increased corrosion.
Note
As the thickness of the tin coating varies, it is necessary to clean
the wiring lug in several stages and check it in between.
– Apply adapter to wiring lug and sand corrosion and dirt off by
rotating adapter.
– Check wiring lug and if necessary re-sand.
– If necessary, remove sanding residue at wiring lug using de‐
burrer.
– Screw wiring lug back on to specified torque.
Note
To ensure optimum contact, tighten all screw-type connections to
specified torque after cleaning.
– Protect connection from corrosion by applying corresponding
anti-corrosion agent ⇒ page 99 .
– Re-connect battery ⇒ Electrical system; Rep. gr. 27 .
4.2 Servicing screw connections
Note
To prevent the screw connection from cracking when the tight‐
ening torque has been exceeded due to a lack of friction in the
thread, do not apply rust remover, contact spray or grease to the
screw connections.
WARNING
