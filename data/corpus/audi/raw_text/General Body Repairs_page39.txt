Repair procedure
Repairing rupture/hole
– Grind down edge of rupture/hole all round to an angle of 45°.
– Lightly sand an area approx. 100 mm wide around the rupture/
hole (hatched area) using 150 grade abrasive paper and clean
with silicone remover.
– Cut three glass fibre mats to shape: -1- to overlap rupture/hole
by approx. 25 mm , -2- overlap approx. 50 mm, -3- overlap
approx. 75 mm.
Note
For large ruptures/holes it is recommended to use a styrene block
as a support. Cover styrene with commercially available unprinted
PE synthetic foil to prevent contact with polyester resin. Then se‐
cure the prepared support to the inside of the rupture/hole with
adhesive tape.
