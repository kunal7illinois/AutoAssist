3.3 Operation of tyre pressure monitoring
system
Function:
The tyre pressure monitoring system is operated via tyre pressure
monitor button -E226- , which is located in the row of switches on
the centre console.
The system monitors the tyre pressures on the four road wheels
that have been set by the operator and stored as reference val‐
ues.
– The inflation pressures must first be checked and corrected,
and then stored by means of the tyre pressure monitor button
-E226- .
– Start by checking and correcting the inflation pressure of the
tyres on the vehicle (including spare wheel) according to the
figures listed on the sticker on the fuel filler flap or on the B-
pillar.
