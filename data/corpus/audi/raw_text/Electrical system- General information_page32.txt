Electrical system; General information - Edition 10.2010
• Battery must NOT be subjected to electrical load within the
next 2 hours prior to measurement.
• After the battery has been charged or the engine has been
running, wait for 12 hours before performing measurements.
• Battery temperature must be at least –10 °C.
After a waiting time of at least 12 hours:
– Measure voltage between battery terminal clamps.
• Specification: 12.5 V or above = battery is OK
– If battery no-load voltage is below 12.5 V, battery must be re-
charged ⇒ page 35 .
– Current draw must be measured after a charging period of
5 minutes ⇒ page 26 .
– If battery no-load voltage is 11.6 V or less, battery is totally
discharged ⇒ page 38 .
4.4 Checking battery by measuring current
draw - vehicles without battery monitor
control unit -J367- or energy manage‐
ment control unit -J644-
Checking the current draw capacity of a battery during charging
allows you to assess quickly whether a p artially or totally dis‐
charged battery ⇒ page 38 can be made serviceable again by
re-charging or whether the battery has to be renewed.
