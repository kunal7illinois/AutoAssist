5 Checking battery - vehicles with bat‐
tery monitor control unit -J367- or en‐
ergy management control unit -J644-
♦ On some models, the electrical system is monitored by the
energy management control unit -J644- or the battery monitor
control unit -J367- in connection with the data bus diagnostic
interface -J533- (allocation ⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical
fault finding and Fitting locations). The battery test for these
vehicles is performed via „Guided Fault Finding“.
♦ If is not possible to check the battery in the „Guided Fault
Finding“ because of a partially or totally discharged battery,
the charge status of the battery can be assessed quickly via
„Checking battery by measuring current draw“.
♦ Do not open maintenance-free batteries; this would invalidate
the warranty.
