Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ Restrictors with a modified hole have been installed at the fac‐
tory since November 1997 (yellow-coloured). The capacity
was increased by 50 g for vehicles with a yellow-coloured re‐
strictor.
♦ In order to distinguish between the two restrictor versions, the
one with the smaller hole (1.54 mm) is yellow-coloured. The
restrictor with the larger hole (1.83 mm) is not coloured.
♦ The Audi A4 was fitted with different air conditioner compres‐
sors depending on the engine and production period. Exclu‐
sive use was made at the start of production of „Zexel / Valeo“
air conditioner compressors. As of Model Year 1996, „Denso“
air conditioner compressors were gradually introduced for ve‐
hicles with 6-cylinder engines.
♦ The logo of the compressor manufacturer „Zexel“ affixed to the
air conditioner compressor was switched as of year of pro‐
duction 2006 (when the manufacturer's name changed) from
„Zexel“ to the new name „Valeo“.
♦ Replacement restrictors with different holes (not coloured, yel‐
low-coloured, red-coloured) are available. If a vehicle is fitted
with a different restrictor, add more or less refrigerant depend‐
ing on type (⇒ Table). After charging, amend capacity stated
on label or affix label indicating new capacity.
♦ Depending on manufacturer, colour of red restrictor may tend
more towards orange.
♦ From November 1998 onwards, Audi A4 models have also
been fitted with „AWG“ condensers (initially approx. 10000
vehicles with chassis numbers between 8DXA 065 253 and
8DXA 077 026). The specified capacity for vehicles with these
condensers differs from those with „Showa“ condensers. The
condensers can be identified on the basis of certain charac‐
teristic features ⇒ page 152 .
♦ If the condenser installed is replaced by one with a different
part number, check the capacity indicated on the label in the
vehicle and amend if necessary or affix a label with the correct
capacity over the existing one ⇒ Heating, air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
