4 General repair instructions
Proper tools and the maximum possible care and cleanliness are
essential for satisfactory gearbox repairs. The usual basic safety
precautions also naturally apply when carrying out repair work.
A number of generally applicable instructions for the various re‐
pair procedures are summarised here. They apply to the work
described in this Manual.
4.1 Contact corrosion!
Contact corrosion can occur if non-approved fasteners are used
on the vehicle (bolts, nuts, washers etc.).
For this reason, only fasteners with a special surface coating are
fitted.
Rubber or plastic parts and adhesives also consist of non-con‐
ductive materials.
If you are not sure whether used parts can be re-installed, always
fit new parts ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
Please note:
♦ The gearbox casing is made of a magnesium alloy.
♦ Use only genuine spare parts: these have been fully tested
and are compatible with aluminium.
♦ We recommend the use of accessories approved by Audi.
Caution
Damage caused by contact corrosion is not covered under
warranty.
