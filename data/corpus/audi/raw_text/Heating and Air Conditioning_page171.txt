Installing
Install in reverse order, paying attention to the following:
♦ Check the receiver at the condenser for contamination by way
of the opening -G-.
♦ Check the thread -G- in the receiver at the condenser for con‐
tamination or damage.
♦ Replace the plastic bolt -A-, the filter element -C- (with the riser
-E-) and the two O-rings -B- and -D-.
♦ Moisten the O-rings -B- and -D- with a small quantity of refrig‐
erant oil before fitting ⇒ page 39 .
♦ Pay attention to correct positioning of the O-rings in the
grooves of the corresponding components.
♦ Keep the bag with the air-tight seal containing the dryer car‐
tridge -F- closed as long as possible. Only open the bag
immediately prior to insertion of the dryer cartridge in the con‐
denser. After opening the bag, the dryer cartridge soon be‐
comes saturated with moisture from the ambient air and thus
unusable.

the hook of the filter element -C-.
– Insert the dryer cartridge -F- together with the filter element
-C- in the receiver of the condenser.
