– Mount tool carrier -2- with injector -3- so injector's rubber seal
lies directly over point of impact. Check by looking in mirror.
– Completely remove threaded spindle -2- from injector -1-.
– Fill injector -1- with 2 to 3 drops resin (this amount is resin is
sufficient for any damage).
– Return resin bottle to package immediately because resin is
UV sensitive.
– Wait until resin advances into rubber seal.
– Tighten injector -1- by turning threaded spindle -2-. The correct
pressure is achieved when the impact point turns clear from
the center out.
Note
The resin penetrates into the cracks very slowly and may not be
visible right away.
– Wait 10 minutes, then release injector to end of threads.
– Hold injector tightly when loosening so that it does not slip.
– Repeat procedure (at least 3 times) until all air is removed from
damage location. You can recognize this by the fact that all of
the cracks will no longer be visible. Tightening the injector cre‐
ates pressure up to 18 bar.
– Note in mirror when the damage location is filled. Then end
injection.
– Then swing carrier with injector to side and check whether
resin has flowed into all points of fracture.
– Remove any possible trapped air with the suction hook placed
on the repair location.
– Cut cover foil -1- keep ready. Remove injector with tool carrier
and lay cover foil immediately on damage location (do not
press down) to prevent air from entering. The foil contains an
activator to dry the resin.
– Immediately return injector to packaging because resin is UV
sensitive and can be reused for the next repair. Replace tool
carrier in released position in case and remove mirror with
mount.
