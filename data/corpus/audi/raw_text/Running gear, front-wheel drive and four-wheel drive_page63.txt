Wheel bearings must not be subjected to load after loosening bolt
securing drive shaft at wheel hub.
If the wheel bearings are subjected to the full weight of the vehicle
they will be overloaded, resulting in reduced service life. There‐
fore please note the following:
Do not attempt to move the vehicle without the drive shafts fitted;
this would result in wheel bearing damage. If the vehicle does
have to be moved, always note the following points:
– Fit an outer joint in place of the drive shaft.
– Tighten the outer joint to 120 Nm.
