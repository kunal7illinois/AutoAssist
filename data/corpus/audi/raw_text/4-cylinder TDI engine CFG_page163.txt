Audi TT 2007 ➤
4-cylinder TDI engine (2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail - generation II), mechanics - Edition 05.2010
Note
The following three steps have to be performed simultaneously
(a second mechanic is therefore required):
– Push idler gear -3- firmly in direction of -arrow- into teeth on
spur gear -2- and balance shaft gear -1-. If necessary use a
wooden rod to do so.
– At the same time, turn balance shaft gear slightly anti-clock‐
wise.
– Tighten bolt securing idler gear.
– Remove crankshaft stop -T10050- .
Note
After installation the idler gear must have no backlash. This can
be checked by exerting light pressure by hand.
Remaining installation steps are carried out in reverse sequence;
note the following:
– Install sump ⇒ page 147 .
– Install vibration damper ⇒ page 56 .
1.7 Re-installing a used balance shaft as‐
sembly
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Locking tool -T10255-
Procedure
Note
♦ If re-installing the "old" balance shaft assembly and neither the
spur gear on the crankshaft nor the crankshaft itself have been
renewed, proceed as described in the following. It is also es‐
sential that the idler gear has NOT been slackened.
♦ If the bolt for the idler gear has been slackened or the spur
gear on the crankshaft or the crankshaft itself have been re‐
newed, you must install a new idler gear with the appropriate
coating. Procedure for installation
⇒ “1.6 Installing a new balance shaft assembly”, page 154 .
♦ Renew bolts securing balance shaft assembly.
