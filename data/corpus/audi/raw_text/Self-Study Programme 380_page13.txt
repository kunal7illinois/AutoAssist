passenger side.This module is already in use in the Audi Q7. However, it has been adapted for the TT Coupé.
Two pyrotechnic propellant charges integrated in a pressurised gas bottle are activated separately by the
airbag control unit.
The so-called cold gas in the pressurised gas bottle is under approx. 250 bar of pressure and is a mixture of
approx. 98 % argon and approx. 2 % helium.
