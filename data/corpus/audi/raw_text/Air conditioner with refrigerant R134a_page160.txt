Note
♦ Restrictors with a modified hole have been installed at the fac‐
tory since November 1997 (yellow-coloured). The capacity
was increased by 50 g for vehicles in which a yellow-coloured
restrictor was installed.
♦ In order to distinguish between the two restrictor versions, the
one with the smaller hole (1.54 mm) is yellow-coloured. The
restrictor with the larger hole (1.83 mm) is not coloured.
♦ If a vehicle is fitted with a coloured restrictor as replacement
for a non-coloured restrictor, add 50 g more refrigerant (see
table). In addition, the capacity specified on the label in the
vehicle is to be checked and amended if necessary or the ex‐
isting label is to be replaced with one indicating the correct
capacity (affix over old label).
♦ The Audi A6 is fitted with different air conditioner compressors
depending on the engine and production period.
♦ In August/September 1998, production was gradually switch‐
ed from air conditioning unit version „1“ to air conditioning unit
version „2“. A reduction in capacity was achieved as the evap‐
orator was also modified together with the air conditioning unit.
♦ The two air conditioner unit versions can be identified on the
basis of certain characteristics described in the vehicle-spe‐
cific workshop manual ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehi‐
cle-specific workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts
catalogue .
♦ The logo of the compressor manufacturer „Zexel“ affixed to the
air conditioner compressor was switched as of year of pro‐
duction 2006 (when the manufacturer's name changed) from
„Zexel“ to the new name „Valeo“.
