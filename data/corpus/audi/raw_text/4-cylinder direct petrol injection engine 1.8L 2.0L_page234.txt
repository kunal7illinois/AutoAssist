Caution
If the turbocharger has suffered mechanical damage (e.g.
damaged compressor wheel), it is not sufficient merely to fit a
new turbocharger. The following work must be performed in
order to avoid further damage:
♦ Check the air cleaner housing, air filter element and intake
hoses for dirt and foreign particles.
♦ Check the entire charge air system (including the charge
air cooler) for foreign matter.
If foreign matter is found in the charge air system, clean all
relevant ducts and hoses and renew the charge air cooler if
necessary.
