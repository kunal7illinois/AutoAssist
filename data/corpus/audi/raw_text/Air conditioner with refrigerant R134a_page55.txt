Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ With V.A.G 1885 for example (for currently available air con‐
ditioner service stations, refer to ⇒ V.A.G workshop equip‐
ment catalogue ), a current vacuum display (LED) is only
obtained after pressing the Evacuation button again.
♦ If, with this air conditioner service station, the upper (green)
LEDs do not light immediately after switching on, either the
refrigerant circuit is leaking or there is still residual moisture/
refrigerant in the circuit.
Proceed as follows if the vacuum is not maintained or an ade‐
quate vacuum cannot be generated:
♦ The pressure in the refrigerant circuit only increases slowly
following evacuation, e.g. due to the evaporation of refrigerant
from the refrigerant oil.
– If it is not certain whether the refrigerant circuit is really leak-
proof, repeat evacuation and observe the vacuum display over
a lengthy period. Charging can only be performed once the
vacuum is maintained.
– It it is certain that there are no leaks in the refrigerant circuit,
charging can be performed.
♦ In the event of a leak of such a magnitude that the ingress of
air on evacuation is already sufficient to prevent the air con‐
ditioner service station generating an adequate vacuum or the
vacuum gauge already indicates the ingress of air and the loss
of vacuum immediately after switching off the air conditioner
service station.
– Determine the leakage location in the refrigerant circuit as fol‐
lows:
