Audi TT 2007 ➤
Direct petrol injection and ignition system (5-cyl. 2.5 ltr. 4-valve turbo) - Edition 03.2009
Note
♦ The test box -V.A.G 1598/42- has 105 sockets. It can be con‐
nected to the engine control unit via 2 different adapter cables.
♦ The engine control unit is connected to the vehicle's wiring
harness via two connectors, one of which has 60 pins, the
other has 94 pins.
♦ To carry out tests on the 60-pin wiring harness connector, the
adapter cable -V.A.G 1598/39-1- is connected to connector
-A- on the test box. For components connected to 60-pin wiring
harness connector ⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical fault
finding and Fitting locations.
♦ To carry out tests on the 94-pin wiring harness connector, the
adapter cable -V.A.G 1598/39-2- must be connected to con‐
nectors -A- and -B- on the test box. Fo r components connec‐
ted to 94-pin wiring harness connecto r ⇒ Current flow
diagrams, Electrical fault finding and Fitting locations.
♦ The test box -V.A.G 1598/42- is designed so it can be con‐
nected both to the wiring harness for the engine control unit
and to the engine control unit itself at the same time. The ad‐
vantage of this is that the electronic engine control system
remains fully functional when the test box is connected (for
example, for measuring signals when the engine is running).
♦ The instructions for performing the individual tests indicate
whether or not the engine control unit itself also needs to be
connected to the test box.
♦ Always use auxiliary measuring set -V.A.G 1594C- to connect
test equipment (e.g. voltage tester -V.A.G 1527B- , hand-held
multimeter -V.A.G 1526D- etc.).
The engine control unit has to be removed before connectors can
be unplugged from engine control unit ⇒ page 47 .
Caution
Electronic components are susceptible to damage.
♦ Select the appropriate measuring range before connect‐
ing the test leads and observe test requirements.
