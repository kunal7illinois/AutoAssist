Note
On vehicles with ultra-high-strength hot-formed steel, spot weld‐
ing equipment with inverter must be used (refer to catalogue for
workshop equipment and special tools).
Yield strength of sheet steel used
1 MPa = 1 Newton/mm2
♦ Steel panels up to 140 MPa
♦ high-strength steel panels from 140 to 240 MPa
♦ extra-high-strength steel panels from 240 to 300 MPa
♦ extra-high-strength steel panels from 300 to 420 MPa
♦ extra-high-strength steel panels from 420 to 1000 MPa
♦ Ultra-high-strength hot-formed steel panels of more than
1,000 MPa
8.2 Galvanised body parts
Preparation
– Only remove underbody protection/sealing materials with a
hot air blower (max. 420 °C) or with a rotating wire brush.
– Remove paint and primer with paint remover (LLE 812 000 A2)
or rotating plastic brush.
Cutting
– Avoid thermal separation techniques (cutting torch) wherever
possible (coarse cuts only).
– To prevent damage to the zinc coating in the cutting area, me‐
chanical cutting procedures are recommended, e.g. using spot
weld cutter or body saw.
Joining techniques
Resistance spot welding (RP) only causes slight burn-off of the
zinc layer in the centre of the spot weld. The protective zinc ring
which is simultaneously built up around the spot weld provides
protection against corrosion.
Always use resistance spot welding (RP) wherever possible.
Note different thicknesses of zinc layers when performing resist‐
ance spot welding (RP) - carry out trial weld.
Only use shielded arc welding (SG) instead of resistance spot
welding (RP) if it cannot be avoided.
Always apply welding primer (zinc spray D 007 500 04) between
joint flanges.
Apply Vario filler (ALN 787 200 10) to joints.
Welding work on galvanised body panels
WARNING
As the welding of galvanised sheet steel gives rise to toxic zinc
oxide in the welding fumes, the workshop must have efficient
ventilation and fume extraction.
