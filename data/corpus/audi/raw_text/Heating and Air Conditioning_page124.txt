– Remove bolts -A- and detach clips -B- from connections of
coolant pipes -C- and -D- at heat exchanger -E-.
– Detach the coolant pipes -C- and -D- from the heat exchanger
-E- (slide the coolant pipes towards the plenum chamber back
wall).
– Pull the heat exchanger -E- out of the air conditioner unit
(heater).
Caution
If necessary for removal of the heat exchanger -E-, bend aside
the lower section of the dash panel -A-. Only bend carefully to
the extent absolutely necessary for removal to avoid damaging
the dash panel.
Installing
Install in reverse order, paying attention to the following:
– Check the seals -A- and -B- attached to the heat exchanger.
Only fit a heat exchanger with intact seals.
Note
♦ Seal may curl up on insertion if not correctly bonded on.
♦ Cold air may flow past heat exchanger if seal is damaged or
not properly fitted.
♦ Additional foam strips -A- are bonded to the corners of the heat
exchanger -B-. These foam strips -A- are designed to prevent
the rattling noise which may occur particularly on vehicles with
a diesel engine. The strips are to be affixed to all heat ex‐
changers (e.g. self-adhesive foam with part number 191 819
069 ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue ).
– With the heat exchanger removed, check the air conditioner
unit (heater) for contamination (by way of the slot -A- for the
heat exchanger).
– Remove any dirt or remnants of escaped coolant from the air
conditioner unit (heater) e.g. after removing a leaking heat ex‐
changer.
– Slide the heat exchanger into the air conditioner unit (heater).
