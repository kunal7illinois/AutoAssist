♦ The new parts may not be provided with the holes for the bol‐
ted connections.
♦ In this case the new parts have to be drilled out for the bolted

5.3 x 5 mm punch rivets were previously fitted in the area of the
suspension strut mounting. A stepped seam (stitch seam) must
be made here instead of the punch rivets.
