Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ Different air conditioner compressors are fitted depending on
the production period and engine.
♦ At the start of production, exclusive use was made of air con‐
ditioner compressors of type „7 SEU 16“ from „Denso“ (e.g. air
conditioner compressor with part no. 1K0 820 803 up to index
„D“). In Model Year 2004 (as of approx. 10.03), a gradual
change was m a de to a different type of „Denso“ compressor
( „7 SEU 17“ e.g. air conditioner compressor with part no. 1K0
820 803 as of index „E“).
♦ With effect from Model Year 2004 (as of approx. 10.03), „Zex‐
el / Valeo“ (type „DSC17E“) and „Sanden“ (type „PXE16“) air
conditioner compressors are also gradually being introduced
depending on the engine ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The logo of the compressor manufacturer „Zexel“ affixed to the
air conditioner compressor was switched as of year of pro‐
duction 2006 (when the manufacturer's name changed) from
„Zexel“ to the new name „Valeo“.
♦ With effect from Model Year 2008, „Denso“ (type „6 SEU 14“)
and „Delphi“ air condtioner compressors were gradually intro‐
duced depending on the engine ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue
and ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 .
♦ This air conditioner compressor is available as a replacement
part with different oil capacities and attention must therefore
be paid to the oil quantity in the air conditioner compressor as
well as the exact part number ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep.
gr. 87 and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
