Audi TT 2007 ➤
6-cylinder injection engine (3.2 ltr. 4-valve), mechanics - Edition 03.2009
Procedure for front row of valves:
– Insert assembly cartridge with knurled spacer ring into guide
plate.
– Push pressure fork down and pull knurled screw upwards,
while turning screw in both directions – this will insert the valve
cotters.
– Release the pressure fork with knurled screw still in pulled po‐
sition.
– Install camshafts ⇒ page 110 .
– Install spark plugs ⇒ Maintenance ; Booklet 808 .
Note
♦ After installing camshafts, wait for approx. 30 minutes before
starting engine. Hydraulic valve compensation elements have
to settle (otherwise valves will strike pistons).
♦ After working on the valve gear, turn the engine carefully at
least 2 rotations to ensure that none of the valves make con‐
tact when the starter is operated.

WARNING
Care must be taken when disposing of old sodium-cooled ex‐
haust valves - risk of injury.
♦ The valves must be sawn in two with a metal saw between
the centre of the stem and valve head. When doing so, the
valves must not come into contact with water.
♦ Then throw a maximum of ten valves into a bucket of water
and step away immediately.
♦ A sudden chemical reaction will occur upon contact with
water in which the sodium filling burns.
♦ After performing these steps the valves can be disposed
of in the normal way.
