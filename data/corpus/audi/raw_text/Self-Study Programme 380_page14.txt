Side airbags
Side airbag igniter, driver side N199
Side airbag igniter, front passenger side N200
Airbag modules which cover both the body and
head areas - so-called head-thorax airbags - are
used as side airbags.
Tubular gas generators filled with solid propellant
inflate the airbags with gas in the event of a crash.

The airbag control unit J234 energises the corresponding side airbag igniter. The ignition charge which is
ignited by the igniter in turn ignites the actual propellant charge. The developing gas is treated and cooled by
the metal filter, whereupon it unfolds and inflates the airbag.
