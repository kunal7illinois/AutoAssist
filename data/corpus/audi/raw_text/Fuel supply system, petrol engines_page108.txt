Fuel supply system, petrol engines - Edition 11.2010
Vehicles with four-wheel drive:
– Unclip the retaining tabs -arrows- for the flange cover (left-
side).
Note
Observe notes on installing flange ⇒ page 85 .
All vehicles (continued):
– Check that the seals under the fuel tank flanges are undam‐
aged and that the locking rings on the flanges are properly
tightened. Also check whether the fuel lines are connected
properly.
– Perform a visual check on all pipe/hose connections of the fuel
tank system and replace leaking pipes/hoses, e.g.:
♦ Line between activated charcoal filter and activated charcoal
filter solenoid valve 1 -N80-
♦ Lines between activated charcoal filter and fuel system diag‐
nostic pump -V144-
♦ Line between fuel tank and activated charcoal filter (below
heat shield for activated charcoal filter).
♦ Fuel tank breather lines behind wheel housing liner (rear right).
♦ Fuel lines to engine.
Note
Leaks in pipes and components of the fuel tank system can
sometimes be detected by applying a non-flammable, environ‐
ment-friendly leak detecting spray. Initiate a tank leak diagnosis
repeatedly to build up pressure in the system. Bubbles will form
at the leak.
– Perform a visual check on the components of the fuel tank
system/fuel tank breather system:
♦ Fuel tank
♦ Activated charcoal filter
♦ Fuel system diagnostic pump -V144-
♦ Activated charcoal filter solenoid valve 1 -N80-
Note
Due to the shape or function of these components it is not always
possible to detect leaks by applying leak detecting spray. If this
is the case, clamp off hoses going to the respective component
using hose clamps up to 25 mm -3094- and initiate tank leak di‐
agnosis. If no leak is then found after clamping off the hoses, the
corresponding component is defective. If the hoses are clamped
off directly at the diagnostic pump and a leak is still indicated,
there is a leak in the diagnostic pump itself.
