WARNING
Care must be taken when disposing of old sodium-cooled ex‐
haust valves - risk of injury.
♦ The valves must be sawn in two with a metal saw between
the centre of the stem and valve head. When doing so, the
valves must not come into contact with water.
♦ Then throw a maximum of ten valves into a bucket of water
and step away immediately.
♦ A sudden chemical reaction will occur upon contact with
water in which the sodium filling burns.
♦ After performing these steps the valves can be disposed
of in the normal way.
