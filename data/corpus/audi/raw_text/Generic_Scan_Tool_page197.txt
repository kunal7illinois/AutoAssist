– Disconnect the Ignition Coils with Power Output Stage -N70,
N127, N291, N292, N323- electrical harness connectors from
the Ignition Coils with Power Output Stage -N70, N127, N291,
N292, N323- .
Checking voltage supply
– Switch the ignition ON.
– Using a multimeter, check the Ignition Coil electrical harness
connector terminals 1 to 4 for voltage.
Specified value: Battery voltage.
– Switch the ignition OFF.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Check the Ignition Coil electrical harness connector terminal
1 through fuse SB8 in fuse panel B to the Engine Control Mod‐
ule (ECM) Power Supply Relay -J271 - terminal 2 (relay ter‐
minal 87) for an open circuit. Refer to Wiring Diagrams for
circuit locations.
Specified value: 1.5 Ω Max.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Check the wiring connection for an open circuit, high resist‐
ance or short circuit to Ground.
– Check the wiring connection for damage, corrosion, loose or
broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection and replace
fuse if blown.
If the specified value was obtained:
Checking activation
WARNING
Do not touch the Ignition Coils connecting parts or adapter ca‐
bles during the following test.
– Disable the power supply to the Fuel Injectors -N30, N31, N32,
N33, N83- by removing fuse.
– Connect a diode test lamp to the Ignition Coil electrical har‐
ness connector terminals 2 and 3.
– Crank the engine while monitoring the diode test lamp.
The LED should flicker.
– Switch the ignition OFF.
If the LED flickers and the voltage was OK:
– Replace the faulty Ignition Coils with Power Output Stage -
N70, N127, N291, N292, N323- Refer to the Repair Manual.
If the LED does not flicker:
Checking wiring
– Remove the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- . Refer to
the Repair Manual.
– Using a multimeter, Check the Ignition Coil electrical harness
connector to the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- elec‐
trical harness connector T60 for an open circuit. Refer to
Wiring Diagrams for pin locations.
