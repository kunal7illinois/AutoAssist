– Apply adhesive DA 001 730 A1 to body side, add parts and
secure. Adhesive bead diameter 3.5 mm.
Add and secure parts within 30 min. Otherwise, the adhesion will
be insufficient due to the formation of a surface skin.
– Install rivets and wipe away escaping adhesive.
Rivets must be installed at temperature up to 68º F (20° C) within
150 min and within 40 min. at temperatures over 68º F (20° C,
beginning at application of adhesive.
Note
♦ If the adhesive escapes on both sides along the entire length,
too much was applied.
♦ 1 cartridge with 37 ml is enough for approx. 4 m of flange.
The adhesive must cure before further surface work.
Curing time:
68º F (20° C: 8 h
176º F (80° C): 20 min.
Note
♦ On large parts, such as the roof, it is necessary to perform the
work with a helper. Otherwise the adhesive will dry before work
is complete.
♦ Before inserting mixing nozzle, ensure double cartridge open‐
ings are clean. Firmly install mixing nozzle and press out a
bead about 10 cm long and apply adhesive.
♦ After breaks up to 30 minutes, press out a bead about 10 cm
long so that new material is mixed. After breaks over 30 min.,
replace mixing nozzle and press out a 10 cm long bead. If more
cartridges are needed for a repair, these can be processed
with a mixing nozzle.
