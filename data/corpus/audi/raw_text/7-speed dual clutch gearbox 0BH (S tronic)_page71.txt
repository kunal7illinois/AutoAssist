7-speed dual clutch gearbox 0BH (S tronic) - Edition 09.2010
• The gear oil that has collected in the overflow pipe -arrow 2-
will drain off first.
Note
Regardless of the gear oil level itself, a certain amount of gear oil
will always drain off when inspection plug -arrow 1- is opened.
– Check that overflow pipe is securely screwed into inspection
plug opening.
Note
The gear oil level cannot be checked reliably if the overflow pipe
is loose.
• The gear oil level is correct if a small amount of oil drains out
when the oil temperature is between 35 and 45 °C (the oil level
rises as the oil temperature continues to increase).
Note
♦ Every 30 seconds a small surge of oil will come out of the
overflow pipe, regardless of the oil level (this is caused by the
intermittent supply of cooling oil to the multiple clutch). This
surge of oil is not relevant when checking the gear oil level and
can be disregarded.
♦ Do not re-use drained-off gear oil.
– If gear oil level is OK ⇒ page 68 .
Filling up with gear oil
– If no gear oil drains out when the oil temperature is between
35°C and 45°C, top up gear oil as follows.
Caution
Take care not to mix the gear oil with other types of oil.
♦ Check that the adapter for oil filling -VAS 6262- is clean.
The gear oil for the dual clutch gearbox must not be mixed
with other types of oil.
– Shake container before opening.
– Screw container of dual clutch gearbox oil onto adapter for oil
filling -VAS 6262- .
