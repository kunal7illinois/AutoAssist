3 Anti-corrosion measures
3.1 Anti-corrosion protection
Corrosion protection as provided when vehicle leaves the factory
must be restored after repairs, using materials which have been
approved by the vehicle manufacturer.
3.2 Long-term body protection
– The inside of new parts must be painted with a topcoat before
the parts are welded in.
– Bright metal areas must be primed immediately following re‐
pairs (corrosion protection primer ALN 002 003 10 or ALK 007
003 10).
– Holes must always be deburred.
– Always apply welding primer (D 007 500 04) to both sides of
welding flanges.
– Prime inside and outside of seam areas prior to sealing.
– Sealing compound must only be applied to primed panel sec‐
tions.
– Make sure you seal overlaps and edges of metal panels, butt
joints, welding seams etc. completely using sealing com‐
pound.
– Restore paintwork.
– Restore underseal using long-life underseal material.
– All cavities in the repaired area must be sealed after applying
topcoat.
– Separating cuts (e.g. in side panel) must be fully sealed.
– After the cavity protection material has dried clear the water
drains.
3.3 Notes on warranty
• 3 years against paint defects, applies to Audi passenger ve‐
hicle bodies built from 25.03.83 onwards
• 6 years against rust perforation, applies to Audi passenger
vehicle bodies built from 07.03.79 onwards
• 12 years against perforation rusting for all Audi vehicles built
from model year 1998 onwards
3.4 Electrolytic galvanisation
During electrolytic galvanisation the sheet steel runs past zinc
anode plates (positive electrodes) as a cathode.
The gap is filled with electrolyte - an acidic, electrically conductive
fluid containing zinc ions.
This is therefore an electrochemical process by which zinc is dis‐
solved and applied to the sheet steel with the help of an electric
current.
