5.1 Manual release of selector mechanism
In the event of fa ilure of the supply voltage to the selector lever
lock solenoid (di s charged battery or defective fuse), or if the sol‐
enoid itself is defective, the selector lever cannot be shifted out
of position “P”. The vehicle then cannot be moved because the
parking lock is engaged.
– Check fuses ⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical fault finding
and Fitting locations.
– Check battery voltage ⇒ Electrical system; General informa‐
tion; Rep. Gr. 27 .
– If no fault is found in the supply voltage, release the selector
mechanism manually as follows:
– Unclip selector lever boot on both sides and lift it off -arrows-.
– Pull selector lever boot up and over handle.
