Note
♦ Overfilling with refrigerant oil may occur if, for example, the air
conditioner compressor has been replaced without adjusting
the quantity of refrigerant oil.
♦ If there is too much refrigerant oil in the circuit, drain the air
conditioner compressor and replace the reservoir. After clean‐
ing the refrigerant circuit (flush with refrigerant R134a
⇒ page 59 or blow out with compressed air and nitrogen
⇒ page 55 ), add the correct amount of refrigerant oil to the
circuit ⇒ page 164 .
