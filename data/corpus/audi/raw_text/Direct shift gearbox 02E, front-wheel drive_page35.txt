3.1 Manual release of selector mechanism
In the event of failure of the supply voltage to the selector lever
lock solenoid (discharged battery or defective fuse), or if the sol‐
enoid itself is defective, the selector lever cannot be shifted out
of position “P”. The vehicle then cannot be moved because the
parking lock is engaged.
Proceed as follows:
– Check fuses ⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical fault finding
and Fitting locations.
– Check battery voltage ⇒ Rep. Gr. 27 .
– If no fault is found in the supply voltage, release the selector
mechanism manually as follows:
– Using a small screwdriver, carefully pry selector lever boot out
of trim for selector lever boot -arrow 1-.
– Pull up both sides of boot and detach boot -arrows 2 and 3-.
– Turn selector lever boot inside out over selector lever handle.
