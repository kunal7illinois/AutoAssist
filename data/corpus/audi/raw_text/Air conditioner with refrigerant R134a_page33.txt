♦ Refrigerant temperature sender -G454- ⇒ page 32
2.5.1 High-pressure switch for air conditioning
system -F23-
Function:
Switches the radiator fan up to the next speed setting in the event
of a pressure increase in the refrigerant circuit (approx. 16 bar).
2.5.2 High-pressure switch for magnetic
clutch -F118-
Function:
Switches off the air conditioner compressor in the event of excess
pressure in the refrigerant circuit (approx. 32 bar).
2.5.3 Low-pressure switch for air conditioning
system -F73-
Function:
Switches off the air conditioner compressor in the event of a pres‐
sure drop in the refrigerant circuit (approx. 2 bar).
2.5.4 Connections with valve for refrigerant
circuit switches
• There are different threads for switches on high and low-pres‐
sure sides.
• Only valves and O-rings resistant to R134a refrigerant and the
related refrigerant oils are to be used.
A - Connection (soldered in)
B - O-ring
C - Valve (with O-ring)
Note
To remove and install the valve core -C- with the refrigerant circuit
