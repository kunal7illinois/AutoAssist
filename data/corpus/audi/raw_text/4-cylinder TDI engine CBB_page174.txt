– Open valve -B- by setting lever in direction of flow.
• The suction jet pump generates a partial vacuum in the cooling
system; the needle on the gauge should move into the green
zone.
– Also briefly open valve -A- (turn lever in direction of flow) so
that hose on reservoir of -VAS 6096- can fill with coolant.
– Close valve -A- again.
– Leave valve -B- open for another 2 minutes.
• The suction jet pump continues to generate a partial vacuum
in the cooling system; the needle on the gauge should remain
in the green zone.
– Close valve -B-.
• The needle on the gauge should stop in the green zone. The
vacuum level in the cooling system is then sufficient for sub‐
sequent filling.
Note
♦ If the needle does not reach the green zone, repeat the proc‐
ess.
♦ Check cooling system for leaks if the vacuum is not main‐
tained.
– Detach compressed air hose.
– Open valve -A-.
• The vacuum in the cooling system causes the coolant to be
drawn out of the reservoir of -VAS 6096- ; the cooling system
is then filled.
– Detach cooling system charge unit -VAS 6096- from coolant
expansion tank.
– Top up coolant to “max” mark.
– Install air cleaner housing ⇒ Rep. Gr. 23 .

– On vehicles with auxiliary heater, switch heater on (for about
30 seconds) and then off again.
– Set temperature to “HI”.
– Switch off air conditioner compressor (press AC button, LED
in button should not light up
– Start engine and run for 2 minutes (maximum) at approx. 1500
rpm.
– Top up coolant to overflow hole on expansion tank with engine
running.
– Close filler cap on coolant expansion tank.
– Allow engine to run at idling speed until two large coolant ho‐
ses at radiator become warm.
– Switch off ignition and allow engine to cool down.
