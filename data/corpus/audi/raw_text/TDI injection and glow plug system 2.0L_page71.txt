10.3 Removing and installing exhaust gas
pressure sensor 1 -G450-
Exhaust gas pressure sensor 1 -G450- is connected via two pipes
to the take-off points upstream and downstream of the particulate
filter. Lambda probe - overview ⇒ page 65
Exhaust gas pressure sensor 1 -G450- detects the amount of de‐
posits in the particulate filter.
Removing
– Remove engine cover panel ⇒ page 20 .
– Before disconnecting, spray hoses coming from exhaust gas
pressure sensor 1 -G450- with suitable release agent.
– Detach electrical connector -1- from exhaust gas pressure
sensor 1 -G450- .
– Carefully pull hoses off connections (take care to keep the ho‐
ses straight; the connections can easily break off exhaust gas
pressure sensor 1 -G450- ).
– Unscrew bolt and remove exhaust gas pressure sensor 1 -
G450- .
Installing
– When installing, note the following:
• Tightening torque for bolt for exhaust gas pressure sensor 1 -
G450- : refer to Lambda probe - overview ⇒ page 65 .
Note
♦ Before installing, blow out hoses leading from exhaust gas
pressure sensor 1 -G450- to particulate filter towards particu‐
late filter with compressed air (hoses can become obstructed
or may ice up due to condensation).
♦ Make sure that hoses are securely fitted and seal properly.
♦ If pressure connections are detached from particulate filter,
tighten to 45 Nm.
Adaption must be performed after renewing exhaust gas pressure
sensor 1 -G450- and/or particulate filter. (The procedure is de‐
scribed under Guided Functions.) Use vehicle diagnostic tester
to do so.
