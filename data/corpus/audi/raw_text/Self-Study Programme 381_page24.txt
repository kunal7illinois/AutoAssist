with the fluid through the piston bores. To "break
up" these chains, force must be applied, i.e. work
must be done. The resistance which the piston must
overcome is greater than in the case of a non-ener-
gised magnetic coil, and is dependent on the
amount of electrical current and the strength of the
magnetic field.
This allows greater damping forces to be achieved.
