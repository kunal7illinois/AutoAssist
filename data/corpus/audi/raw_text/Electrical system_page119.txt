• The horizontal light-dark border should coincide with the set‐
ting line -1- of the test surface on the headlight adjustment unit.
• The break-away point -2- between the horizontal section of the
light-dark border on the left and the vertical section on the right
should coincide with the vertical line running through the cen‐
tral point -3-. The bright spot in the centre of the beam should
be to the right of the vertical line.

uncover the left half of the headlight (as seen in direction of
travel) a few times. Then check dipped beam again.
♦ If dipped beams have been adjusted correctly the centre point
of the main beam should lie on central point -3-.
