– Measure distance -a- between end of valve stem and upper
cylinder head surface with a depth gauge.
– Calculate maximum permissible machining dimension from
measured distance and minimum dimension.
Measured distance minus minimum dimension = max. per‐
missible machining dimension.

Example for long inlet valve:
Measured distance 10.6 mm
Minimum dimension – 10.2 mm
Maximum permissible machining dimension = 0.4 mm
– If the calculated maximum permissible machining dimension
is 0 mm or less than 0 mm, repeat the measurement with a
new valve.
– If the maximum permissible machining dimension is then still
0 mm or less than 0 mm, renew cylinder head.
Note
If the machining dimension is below specification, the proper
functioning of the hydraulic valve clearance compensation cannot
be ensured.
