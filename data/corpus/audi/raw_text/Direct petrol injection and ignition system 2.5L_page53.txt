Direct petrol injection and ignition system (5-cyl. 2.5 ltr. 4-valve turbo) - Edition 03.2009
To help prevent unauthorised access to the connectors on the
engine control unit, the control unit is secured by means of shear
bolts to a locking plate and a metal casing.
The threads of the two shear bolts -4- which are not screwed into
the engine control unit are secured with locking fluid. To unscrew
these two bolts, the threads must therefore be heated with the hot
air blower.
The threads of the two shear bolts -3- which are screwed into the
engine control unit are not secured with locking fluid. Do not apply
heat to the threads in the control unit housing; this is not neces‐
sary and would cause overheating of the control unit.
Select settings on hot air blower as shown in illustration, i.e. set
temperature potentiometer -2- to maximum heat output and two-
stage air flow switch -3- to position 3.
WARNING
Heating the thread of the locking plate also heats up the shear
bolts and parts of the metal housing. Take care to avoid burns.
It is also important to ensure that only the thread is heated and
none of the surrounding components if at all possible. These
should be covered if necessary.
Apply heat to the threads of the shear bolts on the connector side
as shown in the illustration.
