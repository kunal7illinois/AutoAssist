2.18 Lambda probes - overview
Note
♦ Threads of new Lambda probes are already coated with assembly paste; the paste must not get into the
slots on the probe body.
♦ In the case of a used Lambda probe grease only the thread with high-temperature paste. The paste must
not get into the slots on the probe body. For high-temperature paste refer to ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue
♦ When installing, it is important to re-attach the Lambda probe wiring at the same locations to prevent it from
coming into contact with the exhaust pipe.
