10.1.5 Fault localisation in the event of ice for‐
mation at the evaporator
♦ The air conditioner compressor regulating valve -N280- is ac‐
tuated by the air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic control
unit -J255- such that the temperature of the air downstream of
the evaporator reaches the specified value (approx. 2 to 5 °C).
♦ After starting the vehicle, a value greater than 75 % (0.55 A)
is displayed in the measured value block for actuation of the
air conditioner compressor regulating valve -N280- (air condi‐
tioner operating unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- ) depend‐
ing on the measured temperature, engine speed and electrical
system voltage. As soon as the temperature measured by the
evaporator output temperature sender -G263- approaches the
specified value, actuation is cancelled and the compressor
output thus reduced ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function of vehi‐
cle diagnostic, testing and information system VAS 5051 .
♦ Under certain operating conditions, residual moisture in the
refrigerant circuit may lead to the formation of ice at the air
conditioner compressor regulating valve -N280- (and at the
expansion valve). Such ice formation impedes air conditioner
