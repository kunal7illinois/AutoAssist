Installing
• Tightening torque ⇒ page 7 .
Installation is carried out in the reverse order; note the following:
Note
♦ New Lambda probes are coated with an assembly paste.
♦ If reinstalling the old Lambda probes, coat the threads with
high-temperature paste ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The assembly paste/high-temperature paste must not get into
the slots on the probe body.
♦ When installing, the Lambda probe wire must always be reat‐
tached at the same locations to prevent it from coming into
contact with the exhaust pipe.
♦ Fit all cable ties in the original positions when installing.
