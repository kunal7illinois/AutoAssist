Removing
– Before removing the engine control unit -J623- , the adaption
values of the injectors and the ash deposit mass must be read
out. Use vehicle diagnostic tester to do so.
Note
If the adaption values of the injectors of the old (defective) engine
control unit cannot be read out, the adaption values must be en‐
tered into the new engine control unit manually and the adaption
procedure must be performed accordingly.
The engine control unit -1- is bolted to a protective casing
-2 and 5-. To make it more difficult to unscrew the shear bolts
-4- for locking plate -2-, their threads have been coated with lock‐
ing fluid.
The protective housing has to be removed before the connectors
can be unplugged from the engine control unit (e.g. to connect
the test box or renew the engine control unit).
– Switch off ignition and remove ignition key.
– Lever off caps on windscreen wiper arms with a screwdriver.
– Loosen hexagon nuts -arrows- several turns.
– Loosen wiper arms from wiper sha f ts by tilting them slightly.
– Completely remove hexagon nuts and detach wiper arms from
wiper shafts.
Note
Use puller (commercially available) to remove wiper arms if nec‐
essary.
