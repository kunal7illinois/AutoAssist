WARNING
♦ Always read rules for cleanliness and instructions for
working on fuel system ⇒ page 1 .
♦ Follow these instructions and rules for cleanliness before
starting work and while working on the fuel system.
Caution
The high-pressure fuel pump has very close tolerances and
must not be allowed to run without fuel. To prevent this and to
enable the engine to start quickly after parts have been re‐
newed, it is important to observe the following:
♦ If components of the fuel system between the fuel tank
and the high-pressure fuel pump are removed or renewed,
the first fuel filling must be performed.
♦ If a fuel pump, fuel line (between fuel tank and high-pres‐
sure fuel pump) or fuel filter is removed or renewed, the
fuel system must be bled before the engine is started for
the first time.
♦ If the high-pressure fuel pump is removed or renewed, the
fuel system must be bled before the engine is started for
the first time.
♦ Performing first fuel filling after installing high-pressure
pump ⇒ page 33
Note
The high-pressure pump will be damaged if the first fuel filling
procedure is not performed.
