22 Removing Dents
There is a greater danger of stretching with aluminum than with
steel.
Sharp-edged and hard dent removal tools (e.g. steel hammer)
should be avoided and should be replaced with plastic, wood or
aluminum hammers.
Direct dent removal procedures, that is, aluminum panel lies di‐
rectly between counterhold and dent removal hammer, should be
reduced.
In contrast to steel, dent removal work on aluminum panels be‐
gins in the middle of the dent.
Aluminum panels should be pressed more than struck.
Handle counterhold loosely when finishing. Forceful finishing can
cause the material to stretch. Use a hardwood counterhold to
avoid this.
Stretches in the material can be corrected by supplying heat and
retracting.
