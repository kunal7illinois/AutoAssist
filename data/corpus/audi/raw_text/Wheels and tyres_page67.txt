Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
Often, the object is so securely embedded in the tyre that it will
not free itself even at higher speeds. It can then act as a plug and
seal the tyre relatively well. This results in a gradual loss of pres‐
sure, which the driver will not notice immediately, but which can
lead to sudden and complete tyre failure.
8.9 Loss of air from tyre
If the customer complains of a loss of air from a tyre, it is essential
that you check for embedded foreign bodies.
Note
No repair should be attempted o n steel-belted tyres if their struc‐
ture has been punctured by a foreign body.
Corrosion can develop on the steel wires. This will always lead to
the separation of the rubber from the steel belt.
Generally, one cannot determine when the foreign body was em‐
bedded. The tyre structure may already have been damaged as
a result of driving with insufficient tyre pressure.
Damaged belt wires will sooner or later lead to separation of the
rubber from the steel belt. As a result, at some point, the tyre can
fail completely, long after the tyre was first damaged.
Tyre damage caused by foreign bodies is not covered by the war‐
ranty.
