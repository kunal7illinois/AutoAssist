Audi TT 2007 ➤
TDI injection and glow plug system (4-cyl. 2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail, generation II) - Edition 05.2010
Procedure
Note
♦ Note identification marks for cylinder allocation when re-in‐
stalling high-pressure pipes.
♦ The high-pressure pipes can be re-used after performing the
following checks:
♦ Check taper seats of high-pressure pipes for deformation and
cracks.
♦ The bore of the pipe must not be distorted, restricted or oth‐
erwise damaged.
♦ Corroded pipes must not be used again.
Caution
The fuel rail and the clamping pieces can be slackened so that
the injector pipes are not installed under tension. If necessary,
move the fuel rail slightly and turn the corresponding injector
slightly. Never bend the pipes or subject them to tension.
Bending the pipes would ultimately cause them to fracture.
– Use vacuum cleaner to remove dirt from taper seat at fuel rail.
– Clean fuel pipe and end of pipe using cleaning solution and
dry with compressed air.
– Lubricate threads of union nuts with fuel.
– Hand-tighten union nuts on high-pressure pipes (ensure that
pipes are not under tension).
• Tightening torque ⇒ “8.1 Injectors - exploded view”, page 31
– To tighten unions of high-pressure pipes to fuel rail and injec‐
tors, use torque wrench -V.A.G 1331- with socket -T40055- .
– Check fuel system for leaks ⇒ page 30 .
