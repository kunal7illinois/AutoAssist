5 Problems with refrigerant circuit
♦ Possible complaints about refrigerant circuit ⇒ page 97
5.1 Possible complaints about refrigerant
circuit
♦ Test requirements ⇒ page 97
♦ Possible complaints ⇒ page 97
5.1.1 Test requirements:
• Electrical system, vacuum system and air duct fault-finding
has not revealed any faults ⇒ Vehicle diagnostic tester ( „self-
diagnosis“ or „guided fault-finding“ function for air conditioner),
⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical fault finding and Fitting lo‐
cations and ⇒ Heating, air conditioning or ⇒ Air conditioning .
• Air conditioner self-diagnosis/guided fault-finding with the ⇒
Vehicle diagnostic tester has not revealed any faults, no com‐
pressor shut-off criteria displayed in measured value block
(vehicles with „air conditioner“ self-diagnosis only) ⇒ Heating,
air conditioning or ⇒ Air conditioning or „Guided fault-finding“
function ⇒ Vehicle diagnostic tester .
5.1.2 Possible complaints
Note
♦ For all complaints marked *, refer to ⇒ page 103 „Checking
pressures“.
♦ If problems are only encountered at one evaporator on vehi‐
cles fitted with two evaporators, also check the pressures in
the refrigerant circuit.
♦ Heed the test conditions ⇒ page 97 .
♦ Total cooling system failure *
♦ Insufficient cooling output at all vehicle or engine speeds.*
♦ No cooling or insufficient cooling after driving a few miles *
♦ No or insufficient cooling at one or via both evaporators (on
vehicles with two air conditioner units). *
♦ Air conditioner compressor, air conditioning system magnetic
clutch -N25- or air conditioner compressor regulating valve -
N280- shut off by a pressure switch (e.g. -F73-, -F118-, -F129-
-F129- or by the operating and display unit for Climatronic air
conditioning system -E87- or the Climatronic control unit -
J255- ) on account of excessive or inadequate pressure *
♦ No or sharp decrease in fresh-air supply after driving several
miles (evaporator iced up) *
Other possible problems:
Air conditioner compressor noise
– Re-tighten the bolts for the air conditioner compressor and the
compressor holder using a torque wrench.
– Check routing of refrigerant pipes; they must not touch other
components and must not be subject to strain (align if neces‐
sary).
