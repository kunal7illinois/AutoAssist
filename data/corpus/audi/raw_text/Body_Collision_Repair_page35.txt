10.1 Connections between Aluminum/Mag‐
nesium and Steel
Note
♦ With connections between aluminum or magnesium and steel,
the corrosion protection measures described below must be
observed. At attachment points between aluminum and steel
or magnesium and steel:
♦ Fender
♦ Front hood
♦ Doors
♦ You must use protective foil on rear lid.
♦ When bolting aluminum or magnesium to steel, you may only
use Dacromet-coated screws which may only be used one
time. Dacromet is a green, chemical protective coating that
prevents contact corrosion.
♦ Non-metallic fastening or sealing elements (door seals, rear
lid seal) between two different metals should not be electrically
conductive.
♦ You can find special notes about the procedure in the corre‐
sponding repair groups in the repair manuals.
