Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ If a problem involving moisture in the refrigerant circuit only
occurs after a lengthy operating period or only infrequently
(low pressure drops below specification and evaporator ices
up), it is sufficient to replace the dryer (adjust the quantity of
refrigerant oil). Subsequently, evacuate refrigerant circuit for
at least 3 hours.
♦ It is not initially necessary to clean the refrigerant circuit (flush
with refrigerant R134a ⇒ page 59 or blow out with compressed
air and nitrogen ⇒ page 55 ) when this problem occurs. Nor‐
mally, there is only a small quantity of moisture in the system
which can be removed by lengthy evacuation.
Possible deviation from specification Possible causes of fault Fault elimination
• High pressure normal Air conditioner compressor defective. – Clean the refrigerant
circuit (flush with re‐
• Low pressure too low (see graph) frigerant R134a
⇒ page 59 or blow
• Required cooling output is at‐
out with compressed
tained
air and nitrogen
⇒ page 55 ).
– Replace the air con‐
ditioner compressor.
Note
♦ Heed the following in the event of the fault „High pressure nor‐
mal, low pressure too low“: This fault may result in the evap‐
orator icing up or the low-pressure switch for air conditioning
system -F73- switching off the air conditioner compressor al‐
though the quantity of refrigerant in the circuit is OK.
♦ On the Audi 100, Audi A6 (up to and including Model Year
1997) and the Audi V8, this fault may result in the air condi‐
tioner compressor being shut off by the operating and display
unit (if the temperature at the fresh-air blower drops below -3
°C) ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 .
