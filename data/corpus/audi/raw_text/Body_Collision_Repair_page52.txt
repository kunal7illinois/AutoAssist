Special aluminum alloys are used for the body.
The manufacturer heat-hardens the aluminum body after assem‐
bly. A temperature of 400º F (205° C) for 30 min. is needed for
this.
Because it is not possible to harden the body with workshop tools,
replacement parts are delivered pre-hardened.
Only use genuine Audi parts for repairs and follow specified in‐
structions.
