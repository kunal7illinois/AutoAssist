Audi TT 2007 ➤
TDI injection and glow plug system (4-cyl. 2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail, generation II) - Edition 05.2010
Installation position of clamping piece
• One clamping piece is always used to secure two injectors.
• The bulge -arrow- of the clamping piece should point down‐
wards.
8.2 Checking injectors
There are three different tests for checking the operation of the
injectors.
• Checking adaption of “Injector delivery calibration values”
⇒ page 33
• Checking return flow rate of injectors with engine running
⇒ page 33
• Checking return flow rate of injectors at starter cranking speed
⇒ page 36
8.3 Performing adaption of injector delivery
calibration values
The “Injector delivery calibration values” function serves to correct
the injection rates for each cylinder of a common rail system in‐
dividually across the entire operating range.
The 7-digit adaption values -1- (details in illustration are only an
example) are marked separately on each injector. The values
may consist of let ters and/or numbers.
Injector (view from above)
1 - Check sum
2 - Data matrix code
3 - Part number
When a new injector is installed, the adaption value must be writ‐
ten into the engine control unit.
When a new engine control unit is installed, the “Adaption values
for injectors” must be written into the new control unit.
Additionally, check that the “injector delivery calibration values”
are correctly entered for all the other injectors. Do NOT attempt
to re-enter these values if the correct values are already stored in
the engine control unit.
The adaption procedure is described in the “Guided Fault Find‐
ing”. (The procedure is also described under “Guided Functions”.)
