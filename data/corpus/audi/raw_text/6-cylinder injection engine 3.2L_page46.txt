5.2 Checking adjustment of assembly
mountings (engine/gearbox mountings)
Procedure
– Check distances at mounting (right-side) for engine and gear‐
box:
• The two bolt heads -2- must be parallel with edge of support
arm -3- for engine mounting.
• There must be a distance of -x- = 16 mm between engine
mounting -1- and engine support -4-.
Note
Distance -x- = 16 mm can also be checked with a metal rod of
suitable size, or similar.
– If the distance measured is too large or small, the assembly
mountings must be adjusted ⇒ page 41 .
