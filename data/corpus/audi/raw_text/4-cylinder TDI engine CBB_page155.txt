Audi TT 2007 ➤
4-cylinder TDI engine (2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail), mechanics - Edition 04.2010
Note
The following three steps have to be performed simultaneously
(a second mechanic is therefore required):
– Push idler gear -3- firmly in direction of -arrow- into teeth on
drive gear -2- and balance shaft gear -1-. If necessary use a
suitable wooden tool.
– At the same time, turn balance shaft gear slightly anti-clock‐
wise.
– Tighten bolt securing idler gear.
– Remove crankshaft stop -T10050- .
Note
After installation the idler gear must have no backlash. This can
be checked by exerting light pressure by hand.
Remaining installation steps are carried out in reverse sequence;
note the following:
– Install sump ⇒ page 139 .
– Top up engine oil and check oil level ⇒ Maintenance ; Booklet
810 .
– Install vibration damper ⇒ page 49 .
1.7 Re-installing a used balance shaft as‐
sembly
Procedure
Note
♦ If re-installing the "old" balance shaft assembly and neither the
drive gear on the crankshaft nor the crankshaft itself have
been renewed, proceed as described in the following. It is also
essential that the idler gear has NOT been slackened.
♦ If the bolt for the idler gear has been slackened or the drive
gear on the crankshaft or the crankshaft itself have been re‐
newed, you must install a new idler gear with the appropriate
coating. Procedure for installation
⇒ “1.6 Installing a new balance shaft assembly”, page 146 .
♦ Renew bolts securing balance shaft assembly.
