13 Self supporting tyres (SST) with run-
flat capability
Removing and fitting run-flat tyres ⇒ page 10
Note
♦ SST tyres may only be fitted to vehicles which have a tyre
pressure monitoring system. The system warns the driver if
the tyre pressure drops below a specified level.
♦ Tyre damage and the resulting loss of pressure are not readily
visible.
♦ In the event of a total loss of pressure, it is possible to continue
driving for up to 50 km at a maximum of 80 km/h.
Note the special installation instructions for SST tyres.
It is not permitted to fit both SST tyres and standard tyres on the
same vehicle, even on separate axles. A standard tyre can be
fitted only in exceptional circumstances for a brief period and limi‐
ted distance. The driver must be expressly informed that the SST
run-flat characteristics do not apply in this case.
In the event of a puncture, it is the responsibility of the driver to
check the affected tyre or tyres and decide whether it is possible
to continue driving. See ⇒ Owner's Manual .
Use only the approved type of wheels for retrofitting (EH2 exten‐
ded hump rim contour).
