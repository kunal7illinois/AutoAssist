Occupant protection
The belt tensioner igniter is located inside the metal Electrical connector
band loop.
When the igniter is activated by the airbag control Metal band Detonator
unit, the resultant pressure causes the
loop of the metal band to expand.The movement of Seat belt retractor
the metal band exerts a pull on the seat belt shaft
retractor shaft, which thereupon begins to rotate,
tensioning the seat belt.

The casing and casing cover surface between which Casing
the metal band moves are coated in a layer of
silicon. When the metal band moves, it thrusts
a part of this silicon layer ahead of itself and
thereby ensures that a tight seal is maintained.
Pressure losses are thus reduced.
