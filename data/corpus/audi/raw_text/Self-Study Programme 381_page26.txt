Damper
Variable activation of the solenoid valve allows the
shock absorber damping force to be adjusted over a
wide range.

Damping force adjustments are made within millisec-
onds. This allows the damping force to be adapted to
requirements during the bump and rebound cycles.

ECD control unit (electronically controlled damping) J250
The control unit receives the measured data from
the vehicle level sender, as well as information on
the current driving condition from the ESP. The con-
trol unit processes the data and thus determines
the momentary activation currents for the dampers.
Each damper is activated individually. The dampers
are not activated when the vehicle is stationary. The
control unit is located under the front passenger
seat.
