Caution
On vehicles with ceramic brakes the wheel must not be allowed
to drop onto the brake disc. This would cause irreparable dam‐
age to the disc. When removing or fitting a wheel, screw the
long assembly pin into the top wheel bolt hole (12 o'clock po‐
sition) in pla ce of the wheel bolt, and screw the short pin into
one of the ot h er holes to support the wheel. The wheel can then
slide along the assembly pins when fitting or removing it.
Note
♦ Raise vehicle only at jacking points provided.
♦ Do not use screwdriver to pry off trim caps on vehicles with
light-alloy wheels; always use special tool provided (puller
from vehicle tool kit).
♦ To slacken off wheel bolts, always use socket attachments of
the correct size. Worn socket attachments must not be re-
used.
♦ Do not use impact wrenches for slackening off anti-theft wheel
bolts (lockable wheel bolts).
♦ Take care to keep wheel bolts clean.
