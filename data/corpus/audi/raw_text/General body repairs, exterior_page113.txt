1.7 Adjusting convertible roof
Opening dimension for convertible roof
Note
♦ To adjust the convertible roof correctly, observe opening di‐
mension of 35 ± 5 mm.
♦ From the opened position, operate the switch and close the
convertible roof as far as it takes for the hydraulic pump to be
switched off.
♦ The front side of the main mounting for the convertible roof
must be parallel to the front panel of the convertible roof com‐
partment.
♦ The distance between the cross member of the roof frame and
the front cross strut should now be 35 ± 5 mm.
♦ If this distance is not 35 ± 5 mm, check that the main mounting
is parallel to the front panel of the convertible roof compart‐
ment and adjust the position of the mai n mounting if neces‐
sary.
♦ If the opening dimension is still not within the specified range
of tolerance after these measures have been performed, the
opening dimension can be adjusted via the adjuster screw on
the main mounting ⇒ page 108 .
