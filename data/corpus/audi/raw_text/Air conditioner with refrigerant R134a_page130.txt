Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
7.5 Checking pressures on vehicles with ex‐
pansion valve, receiver and air condi‐
tioner compressor regulating valve -
N280- (with externally regulated air
conditioner compressor)
Note
♦ Connect air conditioner service station ⇒ page 99 .
♦ Observe test requirements ⇒ page 103 .
♦ If problems are only encountered at one evaporator on vehi‐
cles fitted with two evaporators, check whether the pressures
in the refrigerant circuit are OK. Check for cross-sectional re‐
striction or blockage of the pipe connection between the prob‐
lematic evaporator and the outgoing pipe connection at the
refrigerant pipe distribution point. If no fault is found, discharge
the refrigerant circuit and re-fill it with the specified quantity of
refrigerant. Then check the pressures and the cooling output
of the air conditioner again. If the problem persists, replace the
expansion valve upstream of the problematic evaporator ⇒

– Check the pressures in the refrigerant circuit (with the air con‐
ditioner service station) with the ignition switched off
⇒ page 103 .
The pressures with the ignition switched off correspond to the
specifications.
– Start the engine.
– Set the engine speed to 2000 rpm.
– Observe the pressure reading (e.g. pressure gauge) of the air
conditioner service station.
Note
♦ The switching pressures for actuation of the air conditioner
compressor regulating valve -N280- and the radiator fans -V7-
are vehicle-specific.
♦ The pressures must be measured at the service connections;
the fitting locations of these connections are vehicle-specific
