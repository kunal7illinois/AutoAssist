Installing
Note
♦ Always renew damaged sensors.
♦ When re-installing used tyre pressure sensors, inspect the
parts to check whether the connection between the sensor and
the valve is damaged.
♦ If tyre sealant has been used, wipe the tyre pressure sensor
clean without removing it and make sure that the aperture for
the pressure sensor is not obstructed. If the aperture is ob‐
structed, the tyre pressure sensor must be renewed to prevent
incorrect readings.
♦ Do not use steam cleaners or a powerful jet of compressed air
for cleaning the tyre pressure sensor.
♦ Hold the valve body when sliding on the new seal and sealing
washer to prevent it from being pushed out (this could damage
the aerial connection).
– Insert tyre pressure sensor with new seal and sealing washer
through rim from inside and press seal into valve drilling ⇒

Note
♦ After installation, the tyre pressure sensor must be seated
firmly against the base of the rim.
♦ The sealing washer -arrow- will be deformed slightly when the
nut is tightened.
