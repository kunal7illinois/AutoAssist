– Unplug the connector -B- at the air conditioning system com‐
pressor regulating valve -N280- -A-.
– Use an adapter lead from the adapter set -V.A.G 1594 C- to
re-establish the connection between the connector -A- and the
connector -B- at the air conditioner compressor regulating
valve -N280- .
Note
♦ Actuation of the air conditioner compressor regulating valve -
N280- and the current measured by the air conditioner oper‐
ating unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- which flows via the
air conditioner compressor regulating valve -N280- are dis‐
played in the measured value block of the air conditioner
operating unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- ⇒ "Guided fault-
finding" function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and information
system VAS 5051.
♦ An adapter lead may also be made for this test. This requires,
for example, one connector -A- and -B- each (with part number
1J0 973 702 and 1J0 973 802 and the corresponding plug
contacts), two commercially available sockets for banana
plugs -C- and two wires with a cross section of 0.5 mm2 .
– Connect the probe -VAS 5051/8- to the adapter leads.
– Test lead (signal wire) to contact -2- of connector -B-.
– Test lead (screen, earth) to contact -1- of connector -B-.
– On the vehicle diagnostic, testing and information system -
VAS 5051 A- , set Measurement mode: DSO (digital storage
oscilloscope).
– Then select the settings 5 V / div DC, 0.5 ms/div (5 V DC and
0.5 milliseconds per unit).
– Start the engine.
– On the air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic control unit
-J255- , set the temperature to the “cold” stop (maximum cool‐
ing output).
– On the air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic control unit
-J255- press the “AC” button (with air conditioner compressor
ON indicator) to activate and deactivate the air conditioner
compressor regulating valve -N280- .
Display on oscilloscope screen will be as follows depending on
setting on air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic control unit -
J255- :
– In “OFF” or “AC off” mode (lamp in “AC” button not lit), no
square-wave signal ( air conditioner compressor regulating
valve -N280- is not actuated).
