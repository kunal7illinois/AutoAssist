Note
♦ When the refrigerant circuit is empty, the leak detection addi‐
tive can be poured into the circuit via a service connection or
an open connection.
♦ If the refrigerant circuit is empty, it may be better to apply the
leak detection additive by way of a joint (e.g. if a joint has al‐
ready been unfastened). In this way, no leak detection additive
is left in the service connection and the connection does not
have to be cleaned.
♦ Application of leak detection additive to the refrigerant circuit
by way of a service connection ⇒ page 93 .
♦ Application of leak detection additive to the refrigerant circuit
by way of an open connection ⇒ page 92 .
