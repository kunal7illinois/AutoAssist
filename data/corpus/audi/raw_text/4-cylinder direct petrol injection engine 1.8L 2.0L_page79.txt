– Clamp the conrod lightly in a vice using aluminium jaw covers
as shown in illustration.
Note
♦ To avoid any risk of damage, the conrod should only be clam‐
ped lightly.
♦ The conrod is clamped in a position below the dotted line.
– Unscrew the two bolts -arrows-. approx. 5 turns.

loose in direction of -arrow-.
