6 Balancing wheels
6.1 General notes
Before you start balancing the wheels, the following requirements
must be met.
• The tyre pressure must be OK.
• The tyre tread must not show one-sided wear and should be
at least 4 mm deep.
• The tyre must not have a flat spot caused by storage or han‐
dling ⇒ page 43 .
A flat spot in the tyre cannot be eliminated by re-balancing.
• The tyre must not show any signs of damage, for example
cuts, piercing, foreign bodies, etc.
• The wheel suspension, steering and steering linkage, includ‐
ing the shock absorbers, must be in perfect condition.
• You must have conducted a road test.
6.2 Conducting a road test before balancing
wheels
If a customer brings a vehicle to the workshop complaining about
“vibration”, a road test is essential prior to balancing the wheels.
♦ This will give you information about the nature of the rough
running.
♦ You will be able to determine in which speed range the rough
running occurs.
– Raise the vehicle on a lifting platform immediately after the
road test.
– Mark the positions of the tyres on the vehicle:
Note
Mark front left tyre “FL”, front right tyre “FR”, rear left tyre “RL” and
rear right tyre “RR”.
– Remove the wheels from the vehicle.
Caution
On vehicles with ceramic brakes the wheel must not be allowed
to drop onto the brake disc. This would cause irreparable dam‐
age to the disc. When removing or fitting a wheel, screw the
long assembly pin into the top wheel bolt hole (12 o'clock po‐
sition) in place of the wheel bolt, and screw the short pin into
one of the other holes to support the wheel. The wheel can then
slide along the assembly pins when fitting or removing it.
– Balance the wheels.
