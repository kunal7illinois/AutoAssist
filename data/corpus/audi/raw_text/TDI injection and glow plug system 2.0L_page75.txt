Note
Cover painted surfaces with a cloth to prevent scratching.
To help prevent unauthorised access to the connectors on the
engine control unit, the engine control unit -1- is bolted on by
means of locking plates -2 and 5- and shear bolts -3 and 4-.
The threads of the two shear bolts -4- which are not screwed into
the engine control unit are secured with locking fluid. To unscrew
these two bolts, the threads must therefore be heated with the hot
air blower.
The threads of the two shear bolts -3- which are screwed into the
engine control unit are not secured with locking fluid. Do not apply
heat to the threads in the control unit housing; this is not neces‐
sary and would cause overheating of the control unit.
