by the system when the navigation CD is loaded.
Likewis, the size of the destination radius as well as
the width of the corridor are updated continuously
in the internal memory. In codedthe event that the
navigation CD is removed, this ensures that the
optimum map section is always stored in the
system memory.
When the navigation CD is removed from the
system, the map content stored at the time of
removal of the CD remains stored in the system
memory. The map content remains stored in the
deactivated system for 72 hours.
This enables one to enter a route from town A to
town B and to navigate between town A to town B
over a lengthy period of time without having to
reload the navigation CD.
Note
When map data is stored in the system, the static current consumption of the system rises
slightly. Map data can only be cleared prematurely by disconnecting the system from the power
supply. Please bear this fact in mind when performing static current measurements on the
vehicle.
