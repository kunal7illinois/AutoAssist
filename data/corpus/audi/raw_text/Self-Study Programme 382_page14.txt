Electrical system and convenience electronics
Immobiliser IV
The immobiliser is integrated in dash panel insert J285.
The immobiliser data is stored in the FAZIT database of AUDI AG.
The immobiliser IV can be adapted using the Audi diagnostic testers in the "Guided Fault Finding" and in the
"Guided Functions" modes.
The diagnostic tester must be online in order to make a connection to the FAZIT database.
The dash panel insert is addressed via the address word 17 and the immobiliser via the address word 25.
This means that data blocks, adaption channels and fault memories are handled separately.

immobiliserIV as well as the FAZIT
database, refer to Self-Study
Programme 294.
