9.7 Checking intake manifold change-over
function
Only perform this test if there is a loss of engine torque (poor
flexibility or lack of pulling power).
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Hand vacuum pump -VAS 6213-
Test condition:
♦ Intake manifold flap valve -N316- has been checked with a
vehicle diagnostic tester.
Perform the following steps if the intake manifold flap valve -
N316- is OK.
– Carefully pull off engine cover panel.
– Start engine and run at idling speed.
– Have a second mechanic rev up engine quickly (short burst of
throttle) and observe vacuum unit for intake manifold change-
over.
• The vacuum unit should pick up -arrow-.
If the change-over does not operate as described:
– Check vacuum system for leaks.
– Check that change-over mechanism moves freely by operat‐
ing linkage manually.
– Check proper connection of vacuum lines.
– Check vacuum hoses for porosity.
