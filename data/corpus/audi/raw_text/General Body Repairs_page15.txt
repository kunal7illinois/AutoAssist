The result is a very even and fine, weakly structured zinc layer
which can be processed further, for instance cut, pressed, wel‐
ded, primed and painted.
3.5 Hot-dip galvanisation
During hot-dip galvanisation the sheet steel runs through an ap‐
proximately 450° C hot molten zinc bath. The sheet steel surface
is covered by an extremely thin zinc-iron alloy which acts as an
“adhesion promoter” for the pure zinc layer, which ultimately has
a thickness of about 10 µ on each side.
Body parts should not exhibit the spangles typically generated by
hot-dip galvanisation and various methods such as re-rolling are
therefore employed to mi n imise this effect.
Concealed parts of floor groups, door pillars and stiffening panels
are hot-dip galvanised on both sides.
