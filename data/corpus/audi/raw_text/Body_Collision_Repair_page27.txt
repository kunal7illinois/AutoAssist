On vehicles with highest-strength steel, spot welding devices with
inverter technology (see workshop equipment and special tools
catalog) are to be used.
7.3.4 Welding emission exhaust system
For spot welding in conjunction with spot weld adhesive, the same
standard exhaust system is used as with welding galvanized pan‐
els.
7.3.5 Preparation
The panels to be welded must be fitted before applying adhesive.
Due to adhesive displacement when spot welding, the bare spot
weld flange is coated with adhesive and thus protected from cor‐
rosion.
The adhesive surfaces in the welding area must be free of primer
and adhesive residue and well as dust and grease.
Our vacuum device -VAS 6216- is recommended for this.
7.3.6 Reconditioning
– Wipe escaping adhesive.
– Corrosion protection measure ⇒ Surface technology / chemi‐
cal materials binder
– Paint structure ⇒ Surface technology / chemical materials
binder
7.3.7 DA 001 730 A1 instructions for use
♦ If the adhesive escapes on both sides along the entire length,
too much was applied.
♦ On large parts, such as the roof, it is necessary to perform the
work with a helper. Otherwise the adhesive will dry before work
is complete.
♦ Before inserting mixing nozzle, ensure double cartridge open‐
ings are clean. Secure mixing nozzle and press out a bead
about 5 cm. long. Then apply adhesive to adhesive surface.
♦ After long breaks up to 30 minutes, press out a bead about 10
cm long so that new material is mixed. After breaks more than
30 min., replace mixing nozzle.
♦ 1 cartridge with 37 ml is enough for approx. 4 m of flange.
♦ The adhesive must cure before further surface work. Curing
time: 68º F (20° C ≈ 8 h 176º F (80° C) ≈ 20 min.
