Removing and installing sender wheel
– Sender wheel -2- must always be renewed after slackening off
bolts -1-.
Note
♦ If the countersunk bolts are tightened a second time, the seats
for the bolt heads in the sender wheel will be deformed to such
an extent that the bolt heads make contact with the crankshaft
-3- -arrows- and the sender wheel beneath the bolts will be
loose.
♦ Sender wheel can only be fitted in one position because holes
are offset.
