Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
8 Renewing components of refrigerant
circuit
♦ Replacing components ⇒ page 136 .
8.1 Renewing components
• All components of the refrigerant circuit submitted for quality
observation are always to be sealed (use the original sealing
caps of the replacement part).
• Replacement air conditioner compressors, reservoirs, receiv‐
ers, evaporators and condensers have so far been filled with
nitrogen gas. This charge is being gradually discontinued/the
pressure of the nitrogen charge is now so low that the escape
of gas is no longer preceptible on initial opening.
• On vehicles fitted with an air conditioner compressor with no
magnetic clutch, the engine is only to be started following
complete assembly of the refrigerant circuit (constant air con‐
ditioner compressor operation).
• When the refrigerant circuit is empty, the air conditioner com‐
pressor with air conditioner compressor regulating valve -
N280- (no magnetic clutch) is switched to internal lubrication
with the result that only a minimal amount of oil is pumped from
the air conditioner compressor into the circuit.
