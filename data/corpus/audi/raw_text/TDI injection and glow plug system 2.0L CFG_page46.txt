– Press return line connections carefully over the seals and onto
the injector units (check seal for damage before connecting
return line). The catch should engage audibly. Then press re‐
lease pin down carefully.
When one or more injectors have been renewed, the “Injector
delivery calibration values” for the new injectors must be pro‐
grammed in the engine control unit.
Additionally, check that the “injector delivery calibration values”
are correctly entered for all the other injectors. Do NOT attempt
to re-enter these values if the correct values are already stored in
the engine control unit.
Bleeding fuel system and checking for leaks
Note
The fuel system is self-bleeding; do not open the high-pressure
connections.
– Run engine at idling speed for several minutes and then switch
off.
– Switch off ignition.
– Check the complete fuel system including all 4 return line con‐
nections for leaks.
Renew affected component if leakage still occurs after tightening
to correct torque.
Note
The return lines can only be renewed together with the pressure
retention valve as one unit.
– After completing the repair, road-test the vehicle over a dis‐
tance of at least 20 km. Accelerate with full throttle at least
once. Then inspect the high-pressure section of the fuel sys‐
tem again for leaks.
Note
If there is any air left in the fuel system, the engine may switch to
the backup mode ('emergency running' mode) during the road
test. Switch off the engine and erase the event memory. Then
continue the road test.
