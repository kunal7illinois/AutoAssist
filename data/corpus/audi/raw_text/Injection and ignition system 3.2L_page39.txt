Injection and ignition system (6-cyl. 3.2 ltr. 4-valve injection engine) - Edition 07.2007
3 Engine control unit -J623-
3.1 Wiring and component check with test
box
Special tools and workshop equipment required
♦ Adapter cable, 121-pin -V.A.G 1598/31- (test box)
Note
♦ The adapter cable, 121-pin -V.A.G 1598/31- (test box) is de‐
signed for simultaneous connection to the wiring harness
leading to the engine control unit and to the engine control unit
itself.
♦ The advantage of this is that the electronic engine control sys‐
tem remains fully functional when the test box is connected
(for example, for measuring signals when the engine is run‐
ning).
♦ The instructions for performing the individual tests indicate
whether or not the engine control unit itself also needs to be
connected to the test box.
♦ Always use auxiliary measuring set -V.A.G 1594C- to connect
test equipment (e.g. voltage tester -V.A.G 1527B- , hand-held
multimeter -V.A.G 1526C- etc.).

3.2 Removing and installing engine control
unit -J623-
The multi-pin connectors of the engine control unit are enclosed
in a protective housing, which is secured by a locking device and
shear bolts -arrows-. To make it more difficult to unscrew the
shear bolts, the threads have additionally been coated with lock‐
ing fluid.
The protective housing has to be removed before multi-pin con‐
nectors can be unplugged from engine control unit (e.g. to con‐
nect test box or renew engine control unit).
