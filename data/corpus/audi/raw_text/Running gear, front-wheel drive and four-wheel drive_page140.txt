2.7 Removing and installing rear left vehicle
level sender -G76- and rear right vehicle
level sender -G77-
General notes:
Vehicles with electronic damping control (Audi magnetic ride)
and/or gas discharge headlights have automatic headlight range
control fitted as standard equipment ⇒ Rep. gr. 94 .
The electronic damping control (Audi magnetic ride) and the au‐
tomatic headlight range control functions require information on
the compression and rebound travel at the front and rear sus‐
pension.
For this purpose, the position of the left/right transverse link in
relation to the body is transferred to the rear left vehicle level
sender -G76- and the rear right vehicle level sender -G77- via a
coupling rod. The senders then transmit electrical signals to the
electronically controlled damping control unit -J250- and/or the
gas discharge light control units (left/right) -J343/344- .
Servicing gas discharge light control unit (left/right) -J343/344- ⇒
Rep. gr. 94 .
On the front axle these signals are supplied by the front left vehicle
level sender -G78- and front right vehicle level sender -G289- to
the electronically controlled damping control unit -J250- and/or
the gas discharge light control units (left/right) -J343/344- .
These signals are required for calculating the current attitude of
the vehicle.
