ble centre bearing (from 05.07 onwards)

Removing
Note
♦ Repairs on the propshaft should preferably be carried out on
a two-pillar hoist.
♦ Before removing, mark the positions of all parts in relation to
each other. Reinstall in the same position to avoid excessive
imbalance, resulting in bearing damage and rumbling noise.
♦ Do not bend propshaft; only store and transport fully extended.
♦ Always support the propshaft during removal; it must not be
allowed to “hang down” from one of the joints.
♦ Always keep the propshaft horizontal while pulling it off or fit‐
ting it on the joint flange.
