9.10 Removing and installing fuel pressure
sender -G247-
The fuel pressure sender -G247- -1- is located in the fuel rail and
continuously measures the fuel pressure in the high-pressure
system. It transmits a corresponding voltage signal to the engine
control unit -J623- .
Should the sender fail, the engine control unit will control the fuel
pressure via a mapped open-loop backup function, allowing a
maximum of approx. 3000 rpm.
