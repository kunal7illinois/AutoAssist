To ensure the proper function of the air mass meter it is important
to observe the following notes and instructions.
Note
♦ Renew O-ring.
♦ If the air filter element is very dirty or wet, dirt or water could
reach the air mass meter and affect the air mass value. This
would lead to loss of power, since a smaller injection quantity
is calculated.
♦ Always use genuine part for air filter element.
♦ Use silicone-free lubricant when fitting air intake hose.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct type of hose clips
