Use clamp tensioner -V.A.G 1682- to fit and tighten stainless steel
hose clip, as shown in illustration.
– Apply clamp tensioner -V.A.G 1682- as shown in illustration.
Ensure jaws of clamp tensioner make contact with lugs
-arrows B- on hose clip.
– Tighten hose clip by turning spindle with torque wrench (take
care to keep tool straight).
Note
♦ Due to the hard material of the CV joint boot (as oppose d to
rubber), a stainless steel hose clip is required; this can only be
tightened using clamp tensioner -V.A.G 1682- .
♦ Tightening torque: 25 Nm.
♦ Use torque wrench -C- with 5...50 Nm adjustment range (e.g.
torque wrench -V.A.G 1331- ).
♦ Ensure that the thread of spindle -A- is not tight. If necessary
lubricate with MOS 2 grease.
♦ If the thread is stiff (e.g. due to dirt), the required clamping
force will not be attained at the hose clip when the specified
tightening torque is applied.
