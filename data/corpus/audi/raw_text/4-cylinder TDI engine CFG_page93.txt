Audi TT 2007 ➤
4-cylinder TDI engine (2.0 ltr. 4-valve common rail - generation II), mechanics - Edition 05.2010
Procedure
– Secure dial gauge -VAS 6079- with measuring bridge -
VW 382/7- and measuring plate -VW 385/17- to cylinder block
as shown in illustration.
– Measure projection at each piston at both locations marked
with -arrows- (seen in longitudinal direction of engine: at front
and rear of piston).
Note
If the measured values for piston projection are not the same for
all pistons, use the highest value to determine the correct gasket
size.
– Depending on piston projection, install corresponding cylinder
head gasket according to following table:
Piston projection above top sur‐ Identification

2 - Holes
3 - Ignore
Note
If the measured values for piston projection are not the same for
all pistons, use the highest value to determine the correct cylinder
head gasket size.
