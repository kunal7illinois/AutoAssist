Fitting instructions: radio communication systems - Edition 10.2010
propriate terminals are to be fitted on the battery end. For the
device end, proceed according to the operating instructions for
radio communication systems ⇒ Operating instructions .
Additional wiring harness is to be routed separately from vehicle
wiring (distance > 10 cm ).
Note
Crossing of standard wiring is preferable to parallel routing.
1.4 Aerial and aerial wire
Use a screened wire between the transmitter/receiver unit and
the aerial. The screen must be connected to the unit and aerial
end. At the same time ensure that there is a good and permanent
earth connection between aerial base wire and vehicle body.
The transmission system must be tuned to prevent sheath waves
on the aerial wire. This should be ensured by performing a power
measurement to check and tune the radio communication sys‐
tem.
„Onglass“ aerials can only be fitted on vehicles without insulating
glass.
1.5 Other auxiliary equipment
Installation of other electronic equipment, such as a business
package (TV, FAX) or household package (electric refrigerator
box) is only permitted if such items bear a CE or e mark. Power
is also to be supplied by way of a separate wiring harness and
provided with fuse protection.
