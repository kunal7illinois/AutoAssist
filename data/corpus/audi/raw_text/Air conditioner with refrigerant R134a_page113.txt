Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
7.2.1 Specifications for pressures in refriger‐
ant circuit
High-pressure side:
Increasing from initial pressure (on connecting pressure gauges)
up to max. 20 bar
Low-pressure side:
Decreasing from initial pressure (on connecting pressure gauges)
to value in graph
A - High pressure (measured at service connection) in bar
B - Low pressure (measured at connection with valve at air con‐
ditioner compressor or reservoir) in bar
C - Permissible tolerance range
D - Low pressure (measured at connection with valve for low-
pressure switch or at service connection) in bar
E - Permissible tolerance range
Possible deviation from specification Possible causes of fault Fault elimination
• High pressure remains constant Not enough refrigerant in circuit – Localise leak with leak detector
or only increases slightly (above and eliminate
pressure with engine stopped)
– Re-charge refrigerant circuit.
• Low pressure quickly drops to
value in graph or below
• Required cooling output is not at‐
tained
• High pressure normal
• Low pressure in line with value in
graph
• Required cooling output is not at‐
tained
• High pressure normal
• Low pressure too low (see graph)
• Required cooling output is not at‐
tained
Note
If no fault is found for this problem, clean refrigerant circuit (flush
with refrigerant R134a ⇒ page 59 or blow out with compressed
air and nitrogen ⇒ page 55 ).
