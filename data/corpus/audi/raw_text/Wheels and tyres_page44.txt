If you detect diagonal erosion, you should fit the wheels on the
driven axle, assuming the wear is identified at an early stage.
Deeper erosion cannot be repaired.
3.8 SA 18 - Wear; SA 11 - Adjustmen t error
In the event of a complaint of diagonal erosion, the toe-in setting
should be checked. If toe-in is correct, the cause of the diagonal
erosion is very probably the tyre itself. In this case, claims can be
made under the warranty.
The wheel alignment protocol should be submitted together with
the complaint report.
Tyres with diagonal erosion caused by incorrectly set axle geom‐
etry at the wheels are not covered by warranty.
3.9 Running gear modifications
If “suspension lowering kits” and/or alloy wheels that have not
been approved by Audi are used as accessories, the wheel po‐
sitions can be altered so that the specified alignment is no longer
maintained while driving.
Even if the axle geometry adjustment is correct with the vehicle
stationary during wheel alignment, the changed vehicle height
and wheel positions can cause the wheel suspension to move
differently when driving.
Uneven wear is then unavoidable.
