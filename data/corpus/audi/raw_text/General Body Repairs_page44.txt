– Fit tool holder -2- with injector -3- so that rubber seal of injector
is positioned exactly above impact point. Check correct posi‐
tion using the mirror.
– Screw threaded spindle -2- completely out of injector -1-.
– Place 2...3 drops of resin in injector -1- (this quantity of resin
is sufficient for one damaged area).
– Place resin bottle back in its packaging immediately, as resin
is UV light sensitive.
– Wait for resin to reach rubber seal.
– Apply pressure to injector -1- by screwing in threaded spindle
-2-. Correct pressure has been attained when impact point
becomes clear, from centre outwards.
Note
The resin penetrates the cracks very slowly; the ingression is not
always immediately visible.
– Wait 10 minutes and then slacken off injector as far as end of
thread.
– Hold injector when unfastening to stop it slipping.
– Repeat procedure (at least 3 times) until all the air has been
displaced from the damaged area. This is indicated by the
cracks becoming less and less apparent as the air is dis‐
placed. A pressure of up to 18 bar is generated when you apply
pressure to the injector.
– Check that damaged area has been filled using the mirror.
Then terminate injection process.
– Swivel holder and injector aside and check that resin has flow‐
ed into all the break points.
– Remove any remaining air pockets with suction cup placed on
repair area.
– Cut off protective foil -1- and keep it to hand. Detach injector
with tool holder and immediately place protective foil over
damaged area (do not press on) to prevent ingress of air. The
film contains an activator for hardening the resin.
– Place the injector back in its packaging immediately, as the
resin is UV light sensitive. It can then be used for the next
repair. Put slackened-off tool holder back into case and detach
mirror with holder.
