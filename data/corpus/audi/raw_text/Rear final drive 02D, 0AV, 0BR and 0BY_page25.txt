Note
♦ In order to achieve the quietest possible running, only the
complete propshaft is balanced during manufacture. The bal‐
ancing of the complete propshaft or the individual propshaft
tubes cannot be carried out with workshop equipment. There‐
fore, if the front or rear propshaft tube is damaged, always
renew the complete propshaft.
♦ Do not bend propshaft; only store and transport fully extended.
♦ Before removing, mark the positions of all parts in relation to
each other. Reinstall in the same position to avoid excessive
imbalance, resulting in bearing damage and rumbling noise.
