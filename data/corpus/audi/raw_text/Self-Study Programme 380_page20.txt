Occupant protection
Belt force limiter, driver side G551
Belt force limiter, front passenger side G552
The front inertia-reel seatbelts have a two-stage belt Torsion shaft II
force limiter. In the event of a collision, the belt
tensioners (band tensioners) are ignited first. The
inertia-reel seatbelt blocks the seat belt retractor Detonator
shaft and prevents the seat belt from unreeling,
which would occur due to the forwards movement
of the occupants. The seat belt retractor shaft is
Spline end
designed as a torsion shaft. To limit the load which
the seat belt places on the occupants, two torsion Gear II
shafts allow controlled unreeling of the seat belt;
belt force limiter.
After a defined interval, the airbag control unit
activates the belt force limiter igniter.
The second torsion shaft is decoupled. The seat belt Seat belt
retractor shaft now counteracts the force which the retractor shaft
seat belt exerts. Gear I
To ensure that the occupants are afforded a good
level of protection, the belt tensioning function, the
belt force limiting function and the front airbags are
380_013
coordinated with each other.
Gears I and II are permanently connected to the seat Torsion shaft II
belt retractor shaft and the second torsion shaft
Spline end
respectively. Gear II
In the initial state, both gears are in mesh with one
another.
