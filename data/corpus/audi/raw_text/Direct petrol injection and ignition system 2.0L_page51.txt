– Fit the assembly cone -T10133/5- with new teflon seal -1- onto
the injector -2-.
– Use assembly sleeve -T10133/6- to press teflon ring seal fur‐
ther onto assembly cone -T10133/5- until it seats in groove.
Do not use any lubricants during this procedure.
Note
The teflon ring is widened as it is pushed onto the injector. The
teflon ring must therefore be compressed again after it has been
fitted. This is done in two steps. The procedure is described be‐
low.
Step 1 of teflon ring seal calibration (adaption) is done with cali‐
bration sleeve -T10133/7- .
– Slide calibration sleeve -T10133/7- onto injector as far as the
stop by pressing lightly and turning approx. 180°. Pull calibra‐
tion sleeve -T10133/7- off again by turning it in the opposite
direction.
Step 2 of teflon ring seal calibration (adaption) is done with cali‐
bration sleeve -T10133/8- .
– Slide calibration sleeve -T10133/8- onto injector as far as the
stop by pressing lightly and turning approx. 180°. Pull calibra‐
tion sleeve -T10133/8- off again by turning it in the opposite
direction.
– Fit new O-ring on injector. Lubricate O-ring lightly with clean
engine oil before installing.
– The teflon ring must not be lubricated.
