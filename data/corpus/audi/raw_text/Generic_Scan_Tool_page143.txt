Checking voltage
– Disconnect the Low Fuel Pressure Sensor -G410- electrical
harness connector -2-.
– Switch the ignition on.
– Using a multimeter, check the Low Fuel Pressure Sensor -
G410- electrical harness connector for voltage.
Low Fuel Pressure Sensor -G410- Specified value
electrical harness connector ter‐
minals
1 to Battery positive (+) Battery voltage
2 to Ground (GND) Near 0 volts
3 to Ground (GND) 5 V
– Switch the ignition off.
If the specified value was obtained:
– Replace the Low Fuel Pressure Sensor -G410- . Refer to ap‐
propriate service manual.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
