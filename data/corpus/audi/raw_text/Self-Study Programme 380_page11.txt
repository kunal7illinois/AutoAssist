Belt-on warning
The Audi TT Coupé ‘07 has a belt-on warning function for the driver.
The airbag control unit evaluates the information from the driver side belt switch E24 after ignition "on". If the
driver is not wearing a seat belt, a visual warning is given by the seat belt warning system warning lamp K19
integrated in the dash panel insert.If the system determines that the vehicle is moving, an audio warning is
given in addition to the visual warning.As long as the ignition is on, the airbag control unit monitors the
switched condition of seat belt switch E24. If seat belt status changes while terminal 15 is "on", the seat belt
reminder will be reactivated.

The "belt-on warning" function needs information

a mechanically actuated open-close switch.

measurement to establish whether the seat belt is
fastened or not.
