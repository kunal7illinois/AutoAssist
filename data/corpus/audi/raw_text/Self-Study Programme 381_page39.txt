Operation and displays
Tyre pressure monitoring is activated with the SET
key. This function must always be activated when
tire pressures are changed or different wheels/tyres
are fitted to the vehicle. This can only be done when
the ignition is on and the vehicle stationary. The
SET key must be pressed for at least 5 seconds in
order to activate the tyre pressure monitoring
function.

The following displays are possible:
– In the event of a rapid loss of pressure at a single
wheel (tyre damage), the red warning lamp is
activated. If the vehicle a driver information sys-
tem, an additional text display appears indicat-
ing the position of the wheel affected.
– In case of slow loss of pressure, which occurs
gradually at multiple wheels due to diffusion, the
red warning lamp is also activated. In this case,
the optional text display appears but no posi-
tional information is given. The displays are acti-
vated when the tyre pressure drops below an a
coded minimum value.
– When system faults are detected, the yellow
warning lamp is activated.
