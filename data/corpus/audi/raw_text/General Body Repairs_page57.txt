21 Removing dents
The danger of material stretching is greater with aluminium than
with steel.
Sharp-edged or hard panel beating tools (e.g. steel hammer)
should not be used. Use plastic, wood or aluminium hammers
instead.
Direct panel beating procedures, i.e. aluminium panel is posi‐
tioned directly between counter-hold tool and panel beating ham‐
mer, should be kept to a minimum.
Unlike the procedure for steel panels, you should begin in the
middle of the dent when removing dents on aluminium panels.
Aluminium panels should be pressed rather than beaten.
When planishing, the counterhold tool should be held loosely.
Forceful planishing can lead to material stretching. Use hardwood
counter-hold tool to reduce this effect.
Material stretching can be rectified by means of heat shrinkage.
