6.15 Suction-jet pump
On vehicles with four-wheel drive the fuel tank is divided into a
left and a right chamber. A so-called suction-jet pump -1- is used
for delivering the fuel from the left fuel tank chamber -3- to the
baffle housing of the fuel delivery unit -2- on the right.
Suction-jet pump: operation
The suction-jet pump operates according to the principle of fluid
entrainment: the stream of fuel from the electric fuel pump is
passed through a nozzle in the suction-jet pump, and is thus ac‐
celerated. The accelerated stream of fuel draws off the surround‐
ing fuel and delivers it to the baffle housing of the fuel delivery
unit.
Faults caused by defective suction-jet pump
Caution
The engine can stop due to fuel starvation if the suction-jet
pump is defective.
♦ If the suction-jet pump is defective, the engine can stop
due to fuel starvation when the tank is still1 /4 full.
If the suction-jet pump is not working, up to 15 litres of fuel (up to
about 1/4 of tank capacity) may remain in the left chamber of the
tank, where it cannot be drawn into the fuel delivery unit.
If the engine stops due to fuel starvation with the tank up to about
1/4 full, proceed as follows:
– Check fuel pump ⇒ page 58 .
If fuel pump is OK, but no fuel is delivered:
– Put another 5 litres (approx.) of fuel into tank.
– Start engine.
If engine now starts:
– Renew suction-jet pump ⇒ page 87 .
