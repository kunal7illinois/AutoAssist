Venting rubber boot
The CV joint boot is often squashed when it is installed on the
joint body. This creates a partial vacuum inside the boot, which
draws in a fold -arrow- whilst driving.
Therefore please note the following:
– Before tightening the hose clips, vent the boot to equalise
pressure by briefly lifting the lip.

– Apply clamp tensioner V.A.G 1682 as shown. Ensure jaws of
clamp tensioner make contact with lugs -arrows B- on hose
clip.
– Tighten hose clip by turning spindle -A- with torque wrench
(take care to keep clamp tensioner straight).
♦ Tightening torque: 20 Nm
Note
♦ Make sure thread of spindle on clamp tensioner moves freely.
Lubricate with MoS2 grease if necessary.
♦ If the thread is stiff (e.g. due to dirt), the required clamping
force will not be attained at the hose clip when the specified
tightening torque is applied.
