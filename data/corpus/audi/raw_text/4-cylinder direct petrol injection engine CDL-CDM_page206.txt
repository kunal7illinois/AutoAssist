charge air system tester -V.A.G 1687- to compressed air -1-.
Note
If there is water in sight glass, remove drain plug -6- and drain
water.
– Open valve -3-.
Caution
Risk of damage if pressure is set too high.
♦ The pressure must not exceed 0.5 bar.
– Adjust pressure to 0.5 bar via pressure control valve -2-.
– Open valve -4- and wait until test system is pressurised. If
necessary, adjust pressure to 0.5 bar again.

felt with the hand; apply commercially available leak detecting
spray or use ultrasonic tester -V.A.G 1842- .
Note
♦ A small amount of air escapes through the valves and enters
the engine. Therefore it is not possible to perform a pressure
retention test.
♦ For operation of ultrasonic tester -V.A.G 1842- , refer to ⇒
Operating instructions .
♦ Release pressure by detaching coupling from adapter -V.A.G
1687/5- before removing adapter.
