Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
– Start the engine with the air conditioner compressor switched
off (version with magnetic clutch).
– Set the air conditioner compressor to minimum output, "Econ"
or A/C off mode (version with no magnetic clutch with a regu‐
lating valve).
– Wait for the idling speed to stabilize.
– Switch on the air conditioner compressor and operate the sys‐
tem for at least 2 minutes at idling speed.
– If necessary, check pressures in refrigerant circuit with air
conditioner service station.
– Switch off engine.
– Screw out handwheel on quick-release coupling adapter.
– Detach the charging hoses from the refrigerant circuit.
– Screw the sealing caps back on.
4.3.7 Pouring refrigerant into reservoir (charg‐
ing cylinder or storage vessel) of air con‐
ditioner service station
• The work procedure must always be performed as described
in the operating instructions of the air conditioner service sta‐
tion.
• A certain quantity of refrigerant is specified as charge for each
air conditioning system. To ensure that neither too much nor
too little refrigerant is added (either would reduce the cooling
output), the charging cylinder has a scale indicating the weight
for example.
• The volume of a refrigerant changes as a function of pressure.
The scale must therefore be set according to the pressure in
the charging cylinder.
Note
Do not completely empty the charging cylinder or storage vessel,
as the liquid column boundary layer cannot be traced in the indi‐
cator tube during filling (outside visible range).
WARNING
Do not overfill. A completely filled charging cylinder or storage
vessel will explode when the temperature rises.
