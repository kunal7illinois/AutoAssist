Instructions for removing dual-mass flywheel
Note
Do not use an impact wrench or pneumatic wrench to remove
bolts -B-: this would severely damage the dual-mass flywheel.
The bolts must always be removed by hand.
– Rotate dual-mass flywheel -A- so that the bolts are aligned
centrally behind the holes -arrows-.
– When removing the bolts, make sure that none of the bolt
heads contacts the dual-mass flywheel, as this would damage
the flywheel when the bolts are unscrewed further.
