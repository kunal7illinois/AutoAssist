4.5 Detaching pulley from “Denso” air con‐
ditioner compressor/re-attaching (ver‐
sion “2”)
Note
♦ Heed the notes on replacement of the pulley -E- ⇒ page 49
(replacing version “1” pulley).
♦ Perform the preparatory work for pulley detachment
⇒ page 48 .
♦ The pulley is made of plastic, is sensitive to impact and should
therefore be treated with extreme care.
♦ If the overload safeguard of the drive plate -C- has been trip‐
ped, the pulley -E- can rotate with the outer section of the drive
plate -C- without the compressor shaft -B- and the hexagon
-D- attached to the drive plate (inner section of drive plate
-C-) also turning.
♦ Detaching/attaching pulley ⇒ page 54 .
4.5.1 Detaching/attaching pulley
Detaching
– Remove the cap -A-.
– Hold the air conditioner compressor drive shaft -B- with a com‐
mercially available hexagon socket wrench (7 mm) for exam‐
ple and turn the drive plate -C- with the pulley -E- in arrow
direction -arrow-.
Note
The torque for driving the air conditioner compressor is applied to
the compressor shaft by way of the bolted joint of the drive plate
-C-. If in the course of air conditioner compressor operation the
drive plate -C- has become so firmly attached to the compressor
shaft that it can no longer be unfastened (the 7 mm hexagon
socket wrench -B- can no longer transmit the necessary torque),
the air conditioner compressor must be replaced.
– Detach the drive plate -C-.
