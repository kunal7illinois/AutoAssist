Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.6.1 Radiator fan control unit -J293-
This control unit activates and deactivates the magnetic clutch
and thus the air conditioner compressor. It switches the radiator
fans and calculates the pressure in the refrigerant circuit on ve‐
hicles with a high-pressure sender -G65- . Refer to ⇒ Current flow
diagrams, Electrical fault finding and Fitting locations, ⇒ Heating,
air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87
(vehicle-specific workshop manual).
2.7 Pressures and temperatures in refriger‐
ant circuit
Caution
♦ When working on the refrigerant circuit, observe generally
valid safety precautions and pressure vessel regulations.
The pressures and temperatures in the refrigerant circuit depend
on the instantaneous operating statuses (e.g. engine speed, ra‐
diator fan speed 1, 2, or 3, engine temperature, air conditioner
compressor on or off) as well as environmental influences (e.g.
ambient temperature, humidity, required cooling output).
On vehicles with air conditioner compressor regulating valve -
N280- the pressure on the low pressure end is altered by actuat‐
ing -N280- .
For this reason, the values given in the following table are only
intended as a rough guide. They are attained at an engine speed
of 1500 to 2000 rpm and an ambient temperature of 20 °C after
about 20 minutes.
Refer to the vehicle-specific refrigerant circuit for the pressure
gauge set measurement connections ⇒ Heating, air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific
workshop manual).
At 20 °C with the engine not running, the pressure in the refrig‐
erant circuit is 4.7 bar ⇒ page 3 (vapour pressure table).
Note
Pressure may be given in various units: 1 MPa (megapascal) cor‐
responds to 10 bar gauge pressure or 145 psi; 1 bar absolute
pressure corresponds to 0 bar gauge pressure, which is roughly
equivalent to atmospheric pressure.
