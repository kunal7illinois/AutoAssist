Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ The Audi A6 is fitted with different air conditioner compressors
depending on the engine and production period.
♦ As of Model Year 2002, the Audi A6 features air conditioner
compressors with a magnetic clutch or regulating valve (dif‐
ferent oil quantities) depending on the engine. This change is
being introduced gradually for the Audi allroad with 6-cyl. die‐
sel engine in Model Year 2003.
♦ As the replacement air conditioner compressor with air condi‐
tioner compressor regulating valve -N280- is supplied with
different oil capacities, the exact part number must be heeded
⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop
manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
