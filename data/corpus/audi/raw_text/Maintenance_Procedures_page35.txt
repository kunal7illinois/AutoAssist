2.19.1 General Information
Note
♦ If the air filter insert is heavily soiled or soaked, dirt particles
or moisture can reach the mass airflow sensor -G70- and
cause an incorrect airflow reading. This causes lack of per‐
formance because a lower injection amount is calculated.
♦ Always use an original air filter insert.
♦ Use a lubricant (silicone-free) when installing intake hose.
♦ Secure all hose connections w ith hose clamps that match cur‐
rent standard production: refer to the Parts Catalog.
♦ Check drain hose in bottom side of air filter or dirt and adhesion
(clean, if necessary).
♦ Clean air filter housing (upper and lower parts) of salt residue,
dirt or leaves (clean with vacuum, if necessary).
♦ Check mass airflow sensor and intake hose (clean air side) for
salt residue, dirt and leaves.
♦ Check the intake canal up to the filter insert for dirt.
♦ When installing air filter insert, ensure it is centered in mount
on bottom of air filter.
♦ Carefully and gently place upper part of air filter on lower part.
When doing so, ensure upper part of air filter is not crooked
on air filter insert. Pay attention to the seal lip on the air filter
insert (air leak).
♦ Finally, screw upper part of air filter onto lower part.
