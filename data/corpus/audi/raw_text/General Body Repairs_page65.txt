29 Welding aluminium
Inert gas welding (MIG) is a technique used both at the factory
and in the workshop.
The inert gas used is argon.
AlSi 12 ∅ 1 mm or 1.2 mm is used as welding wire.
The welder has a current regulator on the handle.
Remove underseal and paint from parts prior to welding and then
use stainless steel brush to remove oxide layer (approx. 40 mm
on both sides).
Weld seams must always be continued around section corners to
prevent crack formation.
Always use extractor -VAG 2011- when performing welding work.
Use 4D0 898 103 sheet metal for practice welding and repairs.
For further details refer to the training documentation on alumini‐
um welding.
For correct welding power supply unit, inert gas and welding wire,
