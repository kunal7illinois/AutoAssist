8.4 Torn tread
8.5 Radial depressions
Radial depressions are slight concavities in the tyre sidewall.
They run from the bead towards the shoulder of the tyre.
Radial depressions are caused by the accumulation of material
at the joints of the tyre components.
Radial depressions do not influence:
♦ Safety,
♦ Service life,
♦ Running characteristics or other properties of the tyre.
Radial depressions are visible to varying extents. It is not neces‐
sary to inspect the tyre or remove it from the rim.
What causes radial depressions?
Modern steel belted radial tyres are constructed with single-ply
sidewalls to save weight.
The sidewall components consist of long strips before they are
joined together to form a tyre. They must overlap at the joints.
Consequently, slight unevenness or ripples are created in the
area of the overlapping parts. The overlaps are easier to see from
the outside due to the single-ply construction.
8.6 Impact damage
A swelling in the sidewall of the tyre indicates that the substructure
of the carcass has been damaged.
Typical causes for such damage include, for example, driving
over kerbs at a sharp angle.
Pinching the tyre in this way can damage the carcass.
The substructure of the tyre is stretched so far that individual fi‐
bres in the carcass may be broken.
The extent of the damage depends on the speed of impact, the
angle of impact, the inflation pressure, the axle load and the type
of obstacle.
