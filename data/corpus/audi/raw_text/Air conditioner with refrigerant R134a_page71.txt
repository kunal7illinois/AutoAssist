Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
4.5.1 Block diagrams for various flushing cir‐
cuits
Note
♦ The arrows in the following illustrations indicate the direction
of refrigerant flow on flushing (during flushing, the refrigerant
flows in the direction opposite to that in air conditioner opera‐
tion; the high-pressure end of the air conditioner service sta‐
tion is thus connected to the low-pressure connection of the
refrigerant circuit to the air conditioner compressor).
♦ The block diagrams illustrate a refrigerant circuit with restrictor
and reservoir and a refrigerant circuit with expansion valve,
receiver and a second evaporator (optional extra for certain
vehicles).
♦ Depending on the design of the air conditioner service station,
non-return valves may be fitted between the refrigerant circuit
and the air conditioner service station (to guarantee the correct
direction of refrigerant flow on flushing).
Refrigerant circuit with restrictor and reservoir
Note
On vehicles with a restrictor and reservoir, the restrictor and res‐
ervoir are removed and the pipes unfastened to remove the
restrictor are connected back together. The pipe connections to
the reservoir removed are connected together with two adapters
and the charging hose -VAS 6338/31- (from the VW/Audi pas‐
senger vehicle adapter set -VAS 6338/1- ).
