Acoustic and thermal insulation have been improved
yet again by using insulating materials for the black
inner headliner exclusive to the automatic
Tensioning strap for tensioner convertible top.
The convertible top linkage for the fully automatic
convertible top is completely covered by the black
inner headliner in the drive motor area.
The rear window is heated and made of scratchproof
mineral glass. It is larger than the predecessor's rear
window and provides good all-round visibility when
the convertible top is up.
Thanks to excellent thermal insulation and the
heated glass rear window, the new Audi TT Roadster
is absolutely winter-proof.
