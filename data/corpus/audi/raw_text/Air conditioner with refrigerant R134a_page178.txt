Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted ⇒ page 136 .
♦ The Audi A4 is fitted with different air conditioner compressors
depending on the engine and production period. As replace‐
ment air conditioner compressors of this type are supplied with
different oil capacities, the exact part no. must be heeded ⇒
Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop man‐
ual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ At the start of production, the compressor types in the first line
of the table were supplied with a refrigerant oil quantity of 180
cm3 . These air conditioner compressors can be recognised
from the index of the part number (8E0 260 805 with one index
or with double index up to „AH“). In Model Year 2004 (as of
approx. 01.04), a gradual change was made to other types of
compressor with a refrigerant oil quantity of 120 cm3 or 130
cm3 . These air conditioner compressors can be recognised
from the index of the part number 8E0 260 805 (with double
index as of „ AJ“) or 4F0 260 805 (and index „E“ for vehicles
with 8-cyl. engine) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The different oil quantities in the air conditioner compressor
may result from the design of the air conditioner compressor
(with or without oil separator at high-pressure connection) or,
in the case of identical air conditioner compressors, from the
design of the refrigerant circuit. Attention is to be paid to these
oil quantities. Too much oil in the circuit results in higher pres‐
sures and reduced system cooling output. Too little oil may
lead to lubrication problems in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
