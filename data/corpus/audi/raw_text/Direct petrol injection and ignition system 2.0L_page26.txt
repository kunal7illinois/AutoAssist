pull air mass meter -G70- out of guide on air cleaner housing.
Installing
To ensure the proper function of the air mass meter -G70- it is
important to observe the following notes and instructions.
Note
♦ If the air filter element is very dirty or wet, dirt or water could
reach the air mass meter -G70- and affect the air mass value.
This would lead to loss of power, since a smaller injection
quantity is calculated.
♦ Always use genuine part for air filter element.
♦ Use a silicone-free lubricant when installing the intake hose.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct type of hose clips
(same as original equipment): ⇒ Parts catalogue
– Check for salt residue, dirt and leaves in air mass meter and
air intake hose (engine intake side).
– Check for dirt in air duct leading to air filter element. If neces‐
sary, clean salt residue, dirt and leaves out of air cleaner
housing (top and bottom sections); wash out or use a vacuum
cleaner as required. Removing and installing air cleaner
