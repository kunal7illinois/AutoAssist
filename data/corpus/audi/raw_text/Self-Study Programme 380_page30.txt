Suspension system
Overview
The Audi TT Coupé ‘07 is available with three different suspension systems. The dynamic suspension system
represents the basic specification. The semi-active "Audi magnetic ride" suspension is optional. The driver can
select between comfort and sport suspension settings at the touch of a button.
quattro GmbH is also offering an S-Line suspension system, which is sportier than the dynamic suspension
system.The main axle components are identical to those of the Audi A3 in respect of their design and
function.

An improved version of the McPherson suspension
is used.The design of the front axle is identical to
that of the Audi A3. Track width is 13 mm wider on
each side than the AudiA3.
Detail modifications have been made to reflect the
particularly sporty character of the Audi TT Coupé
‘07. In addition to the tuning parts (springs,
dampers and anti-roll bars), the same axle
components are used in all TT Coupé suspension
variants.
