Diagram 2:
Tread depth versus tyre life for vehicles with four-wheel drive and
V-rated tyres
P - Tread depth
S - Mileage covered
1 - Front axle
2 - Rear axle
Note
♦ The diagrams shown are not applicable in all cases.
♦ They are merely intended to give an idea of the wear rates of
tyres on the front and rear axles and with front-wheel drive and
four-wheel drive.
♦ The tyre service life may differ significantly, depending on op‐
erating conditions and running gear.
Diagrams -1- and -2- show that the tread on a new tyre wears
faster than the tread on a heavily used tyre. As the wear curve is
not linear, it is not possible to estimate the tyre service life on the
basis of wear after the first 5,000 km.
On front-wheel drive vehicles, the front tyres not only have to
transmit the steering and driving forces, but also the greater part
of the lateral and braking forces. This causes the front tyres on
front-wheel drive vehicles to wear much faster than the rear tyres.
Even tyre wear can be achieved by rotating (interchanging) the
front and rear tyres on a regular basis. Rotating wheels

2.5 Driving style
1. Constant driving speed, no deceleration or acceleration.
Example:
Speed (km/h) Wheel slip Wear
100 1 1
180 3 9
2. Braking
Most wear is caused during braking.
Example: Braking from a speed of 50 km/h.

50 0.2 g 8 4
12.5 0.4 g5) 32 2000-3000
4) g = gravitational acceleration: 9.81 m/s2
5) A deceleration of 0.4 g corresponds to heavy braking.
3. Acceleration (driving style)
Slip caused when driving off gently is approximately the same as
that caused when driving at a constant speed of 100 km/h.
