WARNING
Please observe all relevant safety regulations. Safety-related
components that would no longer meet functional require‐
ments after a repair (e.g. the absorption of impact energy) must
not be repaired.
Repairs that can be performed using plastic repair set D 007 700
include repairs to painted plastic panels, such as the bumpers or
exterior mirror housings. Before starting a repair it is important to
check carefully whether the repair is feasible and economical (i.e.
repair or fit new parts?).
Plastic panels with a structured surface can also be repaired in
this way. However, it will not be possible to achieve quite the
original surface quality of a new part.
