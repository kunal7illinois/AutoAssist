8.3 Construction of belted radial tyres
The illustration shows a cross section of a radial tyre.
1 - Tread block
2 - Tread groove
3 - Tread surface
4 - Nylon ply
5 - Belt layers, usually made of
steel
6 - Bead core, consists of steel
wires vulcanised into rubber.
They ensure secure seating of
the tyre on the rim.
7 - Bead filler
8 - Wheel flange protection
protects the rim and tyre from
abrasion from, for example,
contact with the kerb. Tyres
with Maximum Flange Shield
(or rim protector bar) are
marked with the abbreviation
MFS.
The nylon ply -4-, belt layers -5-, bead cores -6- and bead filler
-7- form the carcass. The carcass is the “load-bearing structure”
of the tyre.
