Standard sound system
This sound system has an auxiliary 5-channel DSP amplifier, the digital sound package control unit J525 which
is diagnosable via CAN. The amplifier supplies the front two-way systems, the rear two-way systems and the
central loudspeakers integrated in the dash panel.
The standard sound system is standard equipment of the concert and symphony radios as well as the
navigation systems with MMI operating logic. These radios or navigation systems do not use an internal
amplifier.
All loudspeakers are diagnosed via the amplifier, i.e. via address word 47. Vehicle model, equipment,
networking and type of driving noise compensation are also coded in the amplifier.
