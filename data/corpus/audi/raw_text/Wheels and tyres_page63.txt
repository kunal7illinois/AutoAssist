8 Tyre damage
8.1 General notes
Note
As tyre damage can have serious consequences, you and the
driver should regularly check the tyres to identify any problems at
an early stage.
Damaged tyres cannot withstand driving conditions such as high
speed, long distances, dynamic driving, etc.
Damage can have a number of causes:
♦ Driving with insufficient inflation pressure.
♦ Assembly error when fitting tyres on rims.
♦ Damage by embedded objects.
♦ Ageing.
♦ Improper storage.
Caution
Whenever a safety risk cannot be ruled out, the tyre must be
renewed.
8.2 Checking tyres
When checking a tyre, look out especially for the following criteria:
♦ Surface erosion or ripples on the inner side (inflation pressure
was too low or not sufficient for the load)
♦ Loose rubber or loose radial threads
♦ Separated or deformed bead core
