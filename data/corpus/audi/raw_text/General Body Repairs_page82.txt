– Apply adhesive DA 001 730 A1 to body side, join parts and
secure in position. Diameter of adhesive bead: 3.5 mm
Parts must be joined and secured in position within 30 minutes
as otherwise the formation of a surface skin will result in inade‐
quate adhesion at the flanges.
– Fit rivets and wipe off emerging adhesive.
At temperatures up to 20° C, rivets must be fitted within 150 mi‐
nutes and at temperatures above 20° C within 40 minutes starting
from application of adhesive.
Note
♦ If adhesive comes out on both sides over the full length of the
joint, this indicates that sufficient adhesive has been applied.
♦ 1x 37 ml cartridge is sufficient for a flange length of approx. 4
m.
Adhesive must cure before performing further surface work.
Curing times:
20° C 8 h
80° C 20 min.
Note
♦ For large parts, e.g. roof, the assistance of a second person
is required, as otherwise adhesive will dry before work is com‐
pleted.
♦ Ensure the openings of the double cartridge are clean before
fitting the mixing nozzle. With mixing nozzle firmly in position,
press out an approx. 10 cm long bead and apply adhesive.
♦ In the event of interruptions lasting up to 30 minutes, press out
and discard an approx. 10 cm long bead to ensure that new
material is properly mixed. In the event of interruptions lasting
longer than 30 minutes, replace mixing nozzle and press out
a 10 cm long bead. If several cartridges are required for repair
work, the same mixing nozzle can be used.
