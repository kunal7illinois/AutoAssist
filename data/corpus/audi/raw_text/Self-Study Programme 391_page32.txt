Electrical convertible top control system
Data exchange Convertible top operation control unit J256
To ensure smooth operation of the convertible top,
the convertible top operation control unit J256
requires various information.
In addition to the information received from the
system's sensors, the control unit requires
information from other automotive systems,
e.g. ESP.
Other control units are also dependent on the
information supplied by the convertible top
operation control unit. This information is
exchanged across the CAN data bus.
The convertible top operation control unit is
integrated in the convenience CAN bus and sends
and receives data across this CAN bus.

interface J533.
There is an intensive and continuous exchange of
data between the individual automotive systems.
The data bus diagnostic interface is located below
the dash panel adjacent the pedal bracket. The
control unit is accessible from the driver footwell.
