12.7 Removing and installing dryer cartridge
Note
♦ There are different versions of the condenser and the dryer
cartridge -F- installed in it (this illustration shows the version
for vehicles with 5-cyl. engine). Pay attention to correct as‐
signment ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The dryer cartridge -F- and the O-ring -B- are of the same de‐
sign for the various types of condenser. If no repair set is
available for the condenser concerned, either replace the en‐
tire condenser or make use of these two components from the
repair set for a different condenser (in this case e.g. from the
repair set for the condenser fitted on the Audi A4 2008 >) ⇒
Electronic parts catalogue . The plastic bolt -A- and the filter
element -C- (with the riser -E-) must however then be cleaned
prior to re-use. The O-ring -D- only provides a seal within the
circuit and can be re-used in this particular case if it is intact.
