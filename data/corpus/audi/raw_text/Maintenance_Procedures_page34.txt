Note
♦ Coolant additive prevents freeze and corrosion damage, scal‐
ing, and raises the boiling point. For these reasons the cooling
system must have coolant additive the whole year.
♦ Especially in countries with tropical climates or when vehicle
is driven under heavy load, the coolant improves the engine
reliability by its increased boiling point.
♦ The coolant concentration must not be reduced by adding wa‐
ter, even during the warmer season. The coolant additive ratio
must be at least 40%.
