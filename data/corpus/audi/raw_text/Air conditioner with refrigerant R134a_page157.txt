Characteristics of refrigerant circuit:
• Restrictor (yellow or red-coloured).
• Reservoir
• „Denso“ air conditioner compressor with air conditioner com‐
pressor regulating valve -N280- (no magnetic clutch)
Vehicle Production period Capacity in grammes Differing characteristics of this refriger‐
model ant circuit
Audi A4 From 11.00 onwards 500 + / - 20 • Yellow or red-coloured restrictor
Audi RS4 From 07.05 onwards 440 + / - 20 • Red-coloured restrictor.
Note
♦ Replacement restrictors with different holes are available (yel‐
low-coloured 1.54 mm, red-coloured 1.42 mm).
♦ Depending on manufacturer, colour of red restrictor may tend
more towards orange.
♦ To avoid altering the cooling output of the air conditioner, only
red or yellow-coloured restrictors are to be fitted. Yellow-col‐
oured restrictors were fitted in model year 2001. Red-coloured
restrictors were introduced in model year 2002. The change
to the restrictor (on vehicles produced in model year 2001, a
red-coloured restrictor may also be fitted instead of a yellow-
coloured one) does not alter the capacity for these vehicles.
♦ Various air conditioner compressors have been fitted depend‐
ing on the production period and engine (these air conditioner
compressors have no magnetic clutch).
♦ At the start of production exclusive use was made of type „6
SEU 12“ and „7 SEU 16“ air conditioner compressors from
„Denso“. From model year 2004 onwards, different „Denso“
compressors (types „6 SEU 14“ and „7 SEU 17“) have gradu‐
ally replaced the old ones. ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87

♦ The Audi RS 4 is fitted with a condenser with a smaller internal
volume. The capacity for this vehicle is therefore lower than
for the other vehicles ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
