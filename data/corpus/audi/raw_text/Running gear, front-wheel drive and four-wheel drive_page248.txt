4.1 General information
Wheel alignment must always be performed using wheel align‐
ment equipment approved by VW/Audi.
The alignment check must always include both the front and the
rear axles.
This is important to achieve proper handling and road behaviour.
Note
♦ Wheel alignment should not be checked until the vehicle has
completed 1000 to 2000 km, when the coil springs have had
time to settle.
♦ When making adjustments, try to obtain the specified settings
as accurately as possible.
♦ Vibrations can also be caused by excessive residual imbal‐
ance and/or radial runout of the wheels.
WARNING
If adjustments are m ade to the suspension geometry, the
steering angle sender -G85- must be calibrated and the steer‐
ing re-adapted on vehicles with ESP or ABS after wheel align‐
ment has been completed ⇒ vehicle diagnosis, testing and
information system VAS 5051 , Guided Functions.
Then:
– 03 - Brake electronics J104
– 03 - Calibration of steering angle sender -G85
If the position of the rear axle and thus the overall running direc‐
tion of the vehicle is not taken into account, this can result in an
off-centre alignment of the steering wheel.
