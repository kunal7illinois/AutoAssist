Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
3.1.1 Conversion of an R12 refrigerant circuit
to an R134a refrigerant circuit and serv‐
icing (retrofit)
Note
♦ For environmental reasons and on account of the correspond‐
ing legislation, refrigerant R12 can no longer be manufactured
or supplied. Refrigerant R134a has been developed as a re‐
placement for R12.
♦ Air conditioning systems developed and designed for refriger‐
ant R12 cannot however simply be charged with refrigerant
R134a. To ensure trouble-free operation of the air conditioning
system even after conversion, various components of the re‐
frigerant circuit must be renewed.
♦ A precise description of the conversion procedure and infor‐
mation on the servicing of converted refrigerant circuits can be
found in ⇒ Workshop Manual: Air conditioner with refrigerant
R12 Parts 2 and 3 (this Workshop Manual is only available in
hardcopy form).
3.1.2 Keeping refrigerant records
The environmental statistics law requires records to be kept on
the use of refrigerants exceeding a certain quantity per year.
Consequently, motor vehicle workshops may well have to provide
the relevant local authorities with information on their use of re‐
frigerant. It is therefore advisable to keep a record sheet ⇒ Audi-
ServiceNet, HSO Environmental Protection .
Note
On the basis of a regulation of the European parliament from
2005, it is generally no longer necessary in the EC to keep a re‐
cord sheet for the quantity of refrigerant handled in motor vehicle
workshops. Other regulations may apply in countries not belong‐
ing to the EC.
