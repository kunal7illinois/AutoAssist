Installing

Installation is carried out in the reverse order; note the following:
Note
♦ You must ensure that the bushes slide free ly, as the clamping
pressure of a stiff bush will be insufficient even when the cor‐
rect tightening torque is applied.
♦ Before fitting poly V-belt, make sure all ancillary units (alter‐
nator, air conditioner compressor) are firmly secured.
