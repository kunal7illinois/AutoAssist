5 General notes on repairs to steel
parts
Note
We recommend that repairs should be performed in a specialist
Audi workshop for aluminium.
These repairs are essentially the same as for vehicles with an all-
steel body. However, special precautions are required due to the
risk of contact corrosion occurring on the aluminium parts of the
body. The dust produced when sanding or grinding steel parts,
and in particular sparks from cutting and welding operations, must
not be allowed to drop onto aluminium parts. This also applies to
painted aluminium panels. The glowing steel particles can dam‐
age the paint and come into contact with the aluminium, which
can cause contact corrosion on the undamaged aluminium body.
For these reasons, the entire body must be carefully protected
with suitable covers and masking while steel repairs are being
performed. Similarly, cutting operations may only be carried out
with mechanical tools (body saw or nibbler). Where sanding or
grinding is unavoidable, use non-sparking sanding/grinding discs
(or such that produce only a minimum amount of sparking).
