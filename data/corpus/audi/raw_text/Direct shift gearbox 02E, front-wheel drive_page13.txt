O-rings, oil seals and gaskets
♦ Renew O-rings, oil seals and gaskets.
♦ After removing gaskets and seals, always inspect the contact
surface on the housing or shaft for burrs resulting from removal
or for other signs of damage.
♦ Renew gaskets: completely remove the old gasket and clean
the sealing surfaces thoroughly.
♦ Lightly lubricate O-rings with gear oil before installation to pre‐
vent them being trapped and damaged during assembly.
♦ Lightly oil the outer circumference of oil seals and pack the
space between the sealing lips -arrow- about half full with
grease ⇒ Parts catalogue .
♦ Do not use any other lubricants where gear oil is specified.
Otherwise, there is a risk of problems occurring in the gearbox
hydraulics.
♦ The open side of the oil seal should face the side containing
the fluid.
♦ Observe rules for cleanliness ⇒ page 10 .
♦ After installation, check gear oil level and top up as required
⇒ page 66 .
Locking elements
♦ Do not overstretch circlips; renew if necessary.
♦ Circlips must be properly seated in the base of the groove.
Nuts, bolts
♦ Slacken bolts in reverse sequence to the specified tightening
sequence.
♦ N u ts and bolts which secure covers and housings should be
loosened and tightened in diagonal sequence and in stages if
no tightening sequence is specified.
♦ Renew self-locking nuts.
♦ Use a wire brush to clean the threads of bolts which are se‐
cured with locking fluid. Then install bolts with locking fluid; for
locking fluid refer to ⇒ Parts catalogue .
♦ The tightening torques stated apply to non-oiled nuts and
bolts.
♦ Where instructions specify a torque setting plus an additional
angle, these bolts must be tightened to the specified torque
and then turned through the specified angle, e.g. 40 Nm + 90°
(90° = a quarter turn).
