The convertible top covers are located on the left
and right-hand sides of the convertible top box and
cover the main bearings of the convertible top
mechanism when the convertible top is open.
The convertible top covers are driven by the
convertible top cover motors V381 and V383.
Potentiometers G596 and G597 are integrated in the
convertible top cover motors to inform the
convertible top operation control unit J256 about
the actual position of the convertible top covers.

Note
After repair work on the convertible top covers, convertible top cover senders G596 and G597 must
be adapted to the convertible top operation control unit J256. This can only be accomplished using
a VAS tester and the Guided Fault Finding or Guided Functions option.
