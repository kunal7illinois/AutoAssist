• Be mindful of the environment and ecology. Before you drain the
crankcase, find out the proper way to dispose of the oil. Do not
pour oil onto the ground, down a drain, or into a stream, pond or
lake. Dispose of in accordance with Federal, State and
Local laws.
• The control module for the Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) cannot
withstand temperatures from a paint-drying booth or a heat
lamp in excess of 95 °C (203 °F) and should not be subjected to
temperatures exceeding 85 °C (185 °F) for more than two hours.
• Before doing any electrical welding on cars equipped with ABS,
disconnect the battery negative (-) terminal (ground strap) and
the ABS control module connector.
• Always make sure the ignition is off before disconnecting battery.
• Label battery cables before disconnecting. On some models,
battery cables are not color coded.
• Disconnecting the battery may erase fault code(s) stored
in control module memory. Check for fault codes prior to
disconnecting the battery cables.
• If a normal or rapid charger is used to charge the battery,
disconnect the battery and remove it from the vehicle to avoid
damaging paint and upholstery.
• Do not quick-charge the battery (for boost starting) for longer
than one minute. Wait at least one minute before boosting the
battery a second time.
• Connect and disconnect a battery charger only with the battery
charger switched off.
• Sealed or "maintenance free" batteries should be slow-charged
only, at an amperage rate that is approximately 10% of the
battery's ampere-hour (Ah) rating.
• Do not allow battery charging voltage to exceed 16.5 volts. If
the battery begins producing gas or boiling violently, reduce the
charging rate. Boosting a sulfated battery at a high charging rate
can cause an explosion.
