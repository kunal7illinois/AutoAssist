3 Secondary air system
3.1 Principle and function
Principle
Because of the over-enrichment of the mixture in the cold start
phase, the proportion of unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust
gas is higher. The secondary air system improves the afterburn‐
ing (oxidation) process in the catalytic converter, and thus re‐
duces toxic emissions. The heat generated by oxidisation
accelerates the light off of the catalytic converter and significantly
improves exhaust gas quality during warm-up.
Function
In the warm-up phase, the engine control unit activates the sec‐
ondary air pump via the secondary air pump relay. The stream of
air from the secondary air pump opens the combination valve for
secondary air and permits air to flow into the exhaust system up‐
stream of the catalytic converter.
