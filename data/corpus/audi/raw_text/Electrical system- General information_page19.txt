3.5 Central gas venting system
To prevent the gas produced when charging the battery from
causing damage or becoming a health hazard in the engine or
passenger compartment, the gas is discharged through a central
opening in the top of the battery cover.
– Make sure that the central gas venting system hose or pipe is
always attached to the battery.
– Make sure the central gas venting system hose or pipe is not
obstructed. Only then is the battery able to vent freely.
Note
More modern batteries are equipped with a fine-mesh flame trap
at the central gas venting outlet. This circular glass-fibre mesh
with a diameter of approx. 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm oper‐
ates like a valve. It allows the gas given off during battery charging
to escape and at the same time prevents ignition of the explosive
gas in the battery.
3.6 Battery terminal screw connection
Observe the following to avoid damaging the battery terminals
and battery housing:
♦ Battery terminal posts must not be greased.
♦ Only connect battery terminal clamps -arrows- by hand without
exerting force.
♦ Fit battery terminal clamps in such a way that the battery ter‐
minal post is flush with the terminal clamp or protrudes from it.
♦ Tightening torque for battery terminal clamps and additional
clamps ⇒ Electrical system; Rep. gr. 27 .
♦ Never re-tighten screw connections after tightening battery
terminal clamps to specified torque.
3.7 Visual inspection of battery
– Visually inspect battery before performing comprehensive
measurements:
♦ External condition of battery
♦ Battery connections
♦ Secure fit of battery
