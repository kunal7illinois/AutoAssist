3.1 Leaks at shock absorbers
Shock absorbers are often replaced because of externally visible
leakage. Inspections on the test rig and in the vehicle have shown
that in the majority of cases this replacement is not justified.
Slight loss of fluid („sweating“) at the piston rod seal is not a rea‐
son for replacing a shock absorber. A shock absorber with slight
fluid leakage can be accepted as "OK" under the following con‐
ditions:
♦ Fluid seepage (as shown in the shaded part of the illustration)
is visible, but the fluid is dull and possibly dried by dust
♦ The fluid seepage extends only from the top shock absorber
seal (piston rod seal) down to the bottom spring plate

3.2 Checking shock absorbers when re‐
moved
Defective shock absorbers can be identified by loud rumbling
noises when driving, caused by wheel hopping, especially on bad
roads. Heavy fluid leakage is an additional visual indication.
Note
Shock absorbers are maintenance-free; shock absorber fluid can‐
not be topped up.
After removal, a shock absorber can be checked by hand as fol‐
lows:
– Compress shock absorber by hand.
♦ The piston rod should move smoothly over the entire stroke
with uniform resistance and without jolts.
– Release piston rod.
♦ If the shock absorber has sufficient gas pressure the piston
rod will return by itself to its original position.
