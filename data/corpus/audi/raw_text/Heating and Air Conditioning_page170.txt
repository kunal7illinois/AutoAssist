Audi TT 2007 ➤
Heating and Air Conditioning - Edition 04.2009
Note
Vehicles with a 5-cyl. engine are currently fitted with a different
type of condenser to vehicles with a 4 or 6-cyl. engine. This con‐
denser -A- has an integrated receiver -B-. In addition, this receiver
-B- is fitted with a dryer cartridge which is not currently available
as a replacement part. If the rectification of problems on this ve‐
hicle involves replacement of the dryer cartridge, a check is
therefore to be made as to whether use can be made of the dryer
cartridge from a different repair set (in this case e.g. from the re‐
pair set for the condenser fitted on the Audi A4 2008 >). If not, the
entire condenser is to be replaced ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue
and ⇒ Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a .
