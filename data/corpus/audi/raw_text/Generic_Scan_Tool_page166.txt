Generic Scan Tool - Edition 07.2011
Testing if display is approx. - 40.0° C
– Disconnect the Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) Sensor -
G62 or G83- electrical harness connector .
– Using a jumper wire, connect the Engine Coolant Temperature
(ECT) Sensor -G62 or G83- electrical harness connector ter‐
minals 1 to 2.
– Check the value indicated on the scan tool display.
If the value jumps to approx. 140.0° C:
– Switch the ignition OFF.
– Replace the Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) Sensor -G62
or G83- .
If indication remains at approx. -40.0° C:
Checking wiring
If the manufacturers test box is being used, perform the following
step.
– Install the test box.
If the manufacturers test box is not being used, perform the fol‐
lowing step.
– Remove the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- . Refer to
the Repair Manual.
– Using a multimeter, check the Engine Coolant Temperature
(ECT) Sensor -G62 or G83- electrical harness connector ter‐
minal 1 to the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- electrical
harness connector for an open circuit or a short to voltage,
refer to the chart below for the appropriate sensor. Refer to
Wiring Diagrams for pin locations.

Specified values: 1.5 Ω Max. and 0 volts disconnected from ECM.
If the specified value was Not obtained:
– Check the wiring for an open or short circuit to Battery (+).
– Check the electrical harness connector for damage, corrosion,
loose or broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is detected in the signal circuit:
– Using a multimeter, check terminal 2 of the ECT sensor to en‐
gine ground.
