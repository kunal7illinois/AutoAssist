Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
7 Vehicle pulls to one side
7.1 General notes
Perform a test drive to determine whether a vehicle is pulling to
one side and if so, which side. If the vehicle pulls to one side, see
procedure on ⇒ page 53 .
If wheel alignment is checked, include wheel alignment test re‐
sults in tyre complaint report.
General notes
Manufacturer's tolerances can lead to a slight amount of taper
(asymmetry) in the tyre carcass. The rolling tyre then develops a
lateral force which acts directly on the wheel suspension, leading
to self-steering of the vehicle. Strategic rotation of the wheels can
balance out this self-steering behaviour.
Taper (asymm etry)
Taper is caused by a slight offset in the tread area and/or the plies
(amounting to a few tenths of a millimetre) in relation to the geo‐
metric centre of the tyre. Taper is not visible and cannot be
measured with equipment available in the workshop.
