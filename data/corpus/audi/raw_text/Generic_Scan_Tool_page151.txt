Specified value: 1.5 Ω max.
If the specification is not obtained:
– Check the wiring for a short circuit to each other, Battery (+),
and Ground (GND).
– Check the electrical harness connector for damage, corrosion,
loose or broken terminals.
– If necessary, repair the faulty wiring connection.
If no malfunction is detected in the wiring and if the voltage supply
was OK:
– Replace the Engine Control Module (ECM) -J623- . Refer to
the appropriate service manual.
– Install the engine cover with air filter. Refer to the appropriate
service manual.
Final procedures
After the repair work, the following work steps must be performed
in the following sequence:
1 - Check the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Memory”,
page 14 .
2 - If necessary, erase the DTC memory. Refer to
⇒ “3.3.4 Diagnostic Mode 04 - Erase DTC Memory”,
page 15 .
3 - If the DTC memory was erased, generate readiness code.
Refer to ⇒ “3.2 Readiness Code”, page 8 .
