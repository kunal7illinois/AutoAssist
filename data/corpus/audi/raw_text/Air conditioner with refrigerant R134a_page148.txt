9.1 Capacities for refrigerant R134a
Note
♦ When charging refrigerant circuits on the high-pressure end,
always fill as far as the upper tolerance limit (liquid refrigerant
remains in the charging hoses).
♦ When charging the refrigerant circuit, the air conditioner serv‐
ice station must be on the same level as the vehicle in which
the refrigerant circuit is to be charged (maximum difference 50
cm). Depending on the design of the air conditioner service
station , an excessive difference in height could lead to differ‐
ences between the quantity of refrigerant displayed and that
actually poured in. The filling accuracy of the air conditioner
service station may vary.
♦ For air conditioner compressor assignment ( „Zexel / Valeo“,
„Sanden“ or „Denso / Nippondenso“), refer to the ⇒ Electronic
parts catalogue and ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87
or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop
manual).
Note
♦ Refrigerant circuits converted from R12 to R134a are to be
filled with the quantity indicated in the Workshop Manual „Air
conditioner with refrigerant R12“. ⇒ Air conditioner with re‐
frigerant R12 (this Workshop Manual is only available in hard‐
copy form).
♦ The logo of the compressor manufacturer „Zexel“ affixed to the
air conditioner compressor was switched as of year of pro‐
duction 2006 (when the manufacturer's name changed) from
„Zexel“ to the new name „Valeo“.
