– Check that the grommet -C- is correctly positioned in the ple‐
num chamber back wall.
– If necessary, apply silicone adhesive sealant to the flanges for
the coolant pipes to the heat exchanger -A- and the expansion
valve (to the evaporator) -B- at the lead-throughs of the grom‐
met -C- (to prevent the ingress of water).
– Make sure coolant hoses are properly connected to heat ex‐
changer. Heed markings:
A - Supply from cylinder head
B - Return to coolant pump
– Re-install the components removed in reverse order with the
exception of the cover for the connections at the heat ex‐
changer and the driver's storage compartment.
– Check the installation position of the coolant hoses with re‐
spect to the heat exchanger (they must not contact compo‐
nents which become hot) and the position and condition of
heat insulation, if fitted on the coolant hoses (not present in all
engine types).
– Bleed coolant circuit: ⇒ Engine, Mechanics; Rep. Gr. 19
Note
♦ When bleeding the coolant circuit, take special care to ensure
complete bleeding of the heat exchanger. If air bubbles remain
in the heat exchanger, complaints may be received about a
lack of heat output in winter or differences in the temperature
of the air flowing out of the vents with the same setting in con‐
trol mode ⇒ page 140 .
♦ Depending on the vehicle equipment and the engine, the cool‐
ant hoses may be provided with thermal insulation. This must
not be damaged and must be re-attached following installa‐
tion.
Check the coolant circuit for leaks e.g. as follows
– Bleed coolant circuit.
– Carefully open the cap at the coolant expansion tank (heed
the safety precautions for opening the cap) ⇒ Engine, me‐
chanics; Rep. Gr. 19 .
– Use the cooling system tester -V.A.G 1274/- hand pump for
example to increase the pressure in the coolant circuit.
