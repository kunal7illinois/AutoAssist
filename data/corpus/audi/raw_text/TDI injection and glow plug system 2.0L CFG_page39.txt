♦ Injection rate comparison meter -V.A.G 1348/2 B-
♦ 4 lengths of hose (made up in the workshop) to fit return line
connections on injectors
Each injector normally has a relatively low return flow rate. If the
return flow rate at one injector is relatively high compared to the
other injectors, that injector is probably defective.
– Clean all return line connections (e.g. with commercial clean‐
ing solution etc.) before removing.
– Dry all components after cleaning.
– Clamp off fuel return hose -arrow- using a hose clamp -3094- .
