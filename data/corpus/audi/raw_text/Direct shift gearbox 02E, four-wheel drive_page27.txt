Direct shift gearbox 02E, four-wheel drive - Edition 08.2008
– Secure universal dial gauge bracket -VW 387- to gearbox
flange.
– For 1st measurement, apply tip of dial gauge to end of input
shaft as shown in illustration.
– Preload dial gauge to 2 mm and set to “0”.
– Lift up multiple clutch as far as it will go.
– Note reading on dial gauge (= axial clearance of input shaft).
– For 2nd measurement, apply tip of dial gauge to hub of inner
plate carrier as shown in illustration.
Note
The tip of the dial gauge must not contact the circlip.
– Preload dial gauge to 2 mm and set to “0”.
– Lift up multiple clutch as far as it will go.
– Take reading and note down measured value.
The thickness of the new circlip is calculated according to the fol‐
lowing formula:
Circlip = 2nd measured value – 1st measured value + 1.85 (=
constant value)
The thickness of the new circlips is graduated in steps of 0.1 mm.
When selecting the required circlip, round up or down to the near‐
est 10th of a millimetre as required. In other words, values up to
0.049 are rounded down and values of 0.050 and above are roun‐
ded up.
Example:
♦ Calculated value for new circlip is 2.27 mm: round up to the
nearest 10th and select circlip with a thickness of 2.3 mm.
♦ Calculated value for new circlip is 2.24 mm: round down to the
nearest 10th and select circlip with a thickness of 2.2 mm.
Note
If the calculated thickness of the new circlip is exactly 2.0 mm, the
circlip fitted previously for taking the measurement does not have
to be removed.
