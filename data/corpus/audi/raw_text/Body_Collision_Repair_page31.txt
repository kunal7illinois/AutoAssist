9.2 Recycling
As an important contribution to preserving the environment, plas‐
tic parts are produced partly from reusable “recyclable” or already
“recycled” raw materials.
Recycling concepts used must be as logistically simple as possi‐
ble for the service organization and the recycling company.
Self-imposed requirements: for basic recycling
– The removability of the parts was already simplified construc‐
tively.
– The variety of plastic part types was reduced.
– The plastic parts were already marked by the manufacturer
according to VDA-260.
With the help of this material identification “standardized coding”,
parts can be separated and collected according to type and tar‐
geted for recycling by the manufacturer or a recycling company.
The identification field contains:
♦ Manufacturer's identification
♦ Part number
♦ Production date and time
♦ Material code
For example, PP+ EPDM -T20- means:
it can be recycled
♦ Polypropylene -PP
♦ Elastomer-modified ethylene-propylene diene monomer
♦ Talcum reinforced - -T20-
