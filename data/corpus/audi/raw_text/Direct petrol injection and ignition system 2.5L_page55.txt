1 General notes and safety precau‐
tions
1.1 General notes on ignition system
♦ The engine control unit has a self-diagnosis capability. Before
carrying out repairs and fault finding, the fault memory must
be interrogated.
♦ A voltage of at least 11.5 V is required for proper operation of
the electrical components.
♦ Certain tests may lead to a fault being detected by the control
unit and stored. The fault memory should therefore be inter‐
rogated and (if necessary) erased after completing the tests
and any repair work that may be required.
♦ If the engine starts, runs for a short period and then cuts out
after completing fault finding, repairs or component tests, this
may be due to the immobiliser disabling the engine control
unit. The fault memory must then be interrogated and, if nec‐
essary, the control unit must be adapted.
1.2 Safety precautions
Note the following if testers and measuring instruments have to
be used during a road test:
WARNING
Accidents can be caused if the driver is distracted by test
equipment while road-testing, or if test equipment is not prop‐
erly secured.
Persons sitting in the front passenger's seat could be injured if
the airbag is triggered in an accident.
• The use of test equipment while driving causes distraction.
• There is an increased risk of injury if test equipment is not
secured.
♦ Move the passenger's seat back as far as it will go.
♦ Use only vehicle diagnosis and service information sys‐
tem -VAS 5052 A- or diagnosis system -VAS 5053- .
♦ The test equipment -1- must rest flat on the passenger's
thighs (as shown in illustration) and must be operated by
the passenger.
To prevent injuries to persons and/or damage to the fuel injection
