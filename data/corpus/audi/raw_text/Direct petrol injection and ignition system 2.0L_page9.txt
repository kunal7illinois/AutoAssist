– The fuse is located in the fuse holder in the luggage compart‐
ment (right-side).
– With engine idling, pull out fuse -SF 6- for fuel pump control
unit -J538- .
Note
Removing fuse -SF 6- will interrupt the voltage supply “termi‐
nal 30” for the fuel pump control unit -J538- .
– Observe fuel pressure displayed on tester.
• The fuel pressure will decrease very quickly because the me‐
chanical high-pressure pump is no longer being supplied with
fuel by the fuel system pressurisation pump -G6- .
– Switch off ignition as soon as fuel pressure has dropped to
approx. 8 bar.
Note
Fuel pressure must not fall below 6 bar, otherwise the engine will
stall (this could damage the catalytic converter).

The fuel lines are still filled with fuel, however the fuel is no
longer under high pressure. Wear safety goggles and protec‐
tive clothing when opening the fuel system to avoid possible
injury and skin contact.
Before opening the high-pressure section, wrap a cloth around
the connection.
– The high-pressure system must be opened “immediately” after
reducing the fuel pressure; wrap a clean cloth around the con‐
nection. Catch the escaping fuel.

pair work:
– Refit fuse.
– Erase fault memory and generate readiness code in engine
control unit in “Guided Functions” mode, using vehicle diag‐
nostic and service information system -VAS 5052 A- .
