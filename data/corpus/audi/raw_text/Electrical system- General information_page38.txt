Electrical system; General information - Edition 10.2010
Note
♦ When charging with battery charger -VAS 5095A- , current
draw of battery must be measured using e.g. trigger clamp,
100A -VAS 5051B/7- . Battery chargers -VAS 5900- , -VAS
5903- , -VAS 5904- and -VAS 5906- indicate the current draw
on the unit.
♦ Information on battery chargers ⇒ Operating instructions for
appropriate battery charger.
Procedure
• Battery temperature must be at least +10 °C.
• The battery charger must be capable of supplying a charging
current of at least 30 A, as is the case for example with the
battery chargers -VAS 5095A- , -VAS 5900- , -VAS 5903- , -
VAS 5904- and -VAS 5906- .
• Battery charger connected and switched on
– Measure battery charging current after a charging period of 5
minutes.
• Specification: Charging current must be greater than 10 % of
rated capacity.
• Example: Charging current for a 60 Ah battery after 5 minute
charging period: greater than 6 A.
– If reading matches specification, continue with charging proc‐
ess until battery is fully charged.
– Then check battery using vehicle diagnostic tester
⇒ page 29 .
– If reading is below specification, renew battery ⇒ Electrical
system; Rep. gr. 27 .
Note
Observe disposal regulations if battery has to be renewed
⇒ page 4 .
5.3 Measuring no-load voltage - vehicles
with battery monitor control unit -J367-
or energy management control unit -
J644- „transport mode not active“
Note
No-load voltage measurement for assessment of battery condi‐
tion is only advisable if it is not possible to test the battery with a
vehicle diagnostic tester and if transport mode is not active in
battery monitor control unit -J367- or energy management control
unit -J644- .
