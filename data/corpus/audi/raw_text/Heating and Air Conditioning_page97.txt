the self-diagnosis function as front air distribution control mo‐
tor -V145- (with potentiometer for front air distribution control
motor -G470- ).
♦ Operation of the control motor can be checked by way of the
“Final control diagnosis” function for example ⇒ "Guided fault-
finding" function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and information

without a tester, connect the two contacts “5” and “6” in the
control motor connector to a 12 V DC source. The control mo‐
tor moves as far as the stop in one direction. Interchanging
positive and negative reverses the direction. Use an adapter
lead for this purpose ⇒ page 91 .

ditioner basic setting ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function of
vehicle diagnostic, testing and information system VAS 5051 .

conditioner can be checked by way of the “Final control diag‐
nosis” and “Basic setting” functions (e.g. to check for inter‐

tic, testing and information system VAS 5051 .
