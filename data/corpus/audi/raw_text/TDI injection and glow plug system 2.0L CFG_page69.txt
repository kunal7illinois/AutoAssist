Select settings on hot air blower as shown in illustration, i.e. set
temperature potentiometer -2- to maximum heat output and two-
stage air flow switch -3- to position 3.
WARNING
Heating the thread of the locking plate also heats up the shear
bolts and parts of the metal housing. Take care to avoid burns.
It is also important to ensure that only the thread is heated and
none of the surrounding components if at all possible. These
should be covered if necessary.
Switch on the hot air blower and heat the bolt for approximately
20 ... 30 seconds.
– Unscrew shear bolts using suitable vice-grip pliers (see arrow
in illustration).
– The two shear bolts screwed into the engine control unit do
not need to be heated. They can be removed without heating.
– Detach protective housing from control unit connectors.
– Unscrew both securing bolts from engine control unit -J623- .
