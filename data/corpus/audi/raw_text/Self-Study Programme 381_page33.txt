Final control diagnostics
The shock absorber dampers can be activated selec-
tively in the final control diagnostics.
The shock absorber dampers are activated by apply-
ing a current of 2A.
Data blocks
The data blocks are used to check key system status
information.The temperature values calculated for
the dampers and control unit, for example, are rep-
resente d in data block 28.
Cold starting
When control unit J250 or shock absorber dampers
are replaced, the control unit must determine the
electrical resistance values of the damper coils at
ambient temperature. The control unit saves these
values as "standard values" for purposes of temper-
ature compensation (refer to "Special functions -
temperature model").
This function is activated automatically after igni-
tion on, provided the vehicle has been out of use for
at least 3 hours (e.g. even after a a cold start in the
morning) . During this time not in use, the tempera-
tures of the dampers have adjusted to the ambient
temperature. If the mechanic has fitted shock
absorber dampers which are already at ambient
temperature (e.g. parts sourced directly from the
spare parts warehouse), the resistance measure-
ment function can be started immediately by acti-
vating the "Cold start" function with the diagnostic
tester.
Flashing
The control unit software can be flashed by an exter-
nal data carrier (CD, online interface) .
