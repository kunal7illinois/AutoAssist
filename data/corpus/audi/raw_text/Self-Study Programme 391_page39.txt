Note
Diagnostics:
There is no control unit between the
sensor and actuator (DC motor). This task is
performed by two relays. No diagnosis is
given for this reason. Hence, no entries
are made in the fault memory in the event
of a fault.
Consequently, no data blocks, adapta-
tions, codings or final control diagnostics
are available this function in the diagnostic
tester.
