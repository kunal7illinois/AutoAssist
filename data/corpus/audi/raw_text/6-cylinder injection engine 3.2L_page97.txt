– Tighten the camshaft adjuster (inlet side) in this position to the
inlet camshaft finger-tight.
• Contact surface of sender wheel at bolt head must be dry when
installing.
• The marking “24E” -item 1- and the tooth just behind it must
align with the notch -2- in the valve timing housing. Markings
on valve timing housing ⇒ page 85
– Lay the camshaft timing chain in this position tautly onto the
chain sprocket of camshaft adjuster (inlet side).
– Now count exactly 16 rollers on timing chain to the right start‐
ing at gear aligning with marking “24E”. Mark this roller with
coloured pen.
Note
The camshaft adjuster (exhaust side) is locked in “rest position”,
so the sender wheel cannot be turned out of position when ad‐
justing the valve timing. If the camshaft adjuster is not locked in
“rest position”, turn adjuster by hand in both directions until it en‐
gages. If this is not possible, renew camshaft adjuster.
– Fit camshaft adjuster (exhaust side) “32A” into camshaft roller
chain with gear tooth at marking -1-, so that there are exactly
the 16 counted rollers between marking “24E” and “32A” and
the markings -1- and -2- align.
– It must be easily possible to attach camshaft adjuster (exhaust
side) to camshaft (exhaust side) and to tighten it hand-tight.
