Parking aid control unit J446
Introduction
The Audi TT Coupé ´07 is equipped for the first time with an acoustic parking system with ultrasonic sensors
as featured previously in other Audi models. A 4-channel rear acoustic parking system is available as optional
equipment.
The term "4-channel rear acoustic parking system" means that 4 acoustic parking sensors which monitor the
area behind the vehicle are integrated in the rear bumper cover.
Acoustic parking system control unit J446
The acoustic parking system control unit J446 is
a carry-over part from the Audi A3 ‘04. Both the
hardware and the software are identical.
The systems in the Audi TT Coupé ´07 and in the
Audi A3 ’04 (different installation positions of the
acoustic parking sensor in the rear bumper) are
differentiated by the software based on the control
unit coding.
