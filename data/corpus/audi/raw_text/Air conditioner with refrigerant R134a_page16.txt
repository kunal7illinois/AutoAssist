its ability to withstand pressure. There is also a danger of refrig‐
erant decomposition due to localised overheating.
Sealing empty vessels
Empty refrigerant vessels must always be sealed to prevent the
ingress of moisture. Moisture causes steel containers to rust. This
weakens the vessel walls. In addition, any rust particles which
enter refrigeration systems from storage vessels will cause mal‐
functioning.
1.12 Safety regulations for working with ex‐
traction and charging systems
• Before connecting the charging system to the air conditioning
system, ensure that the shut-off valves are closed.
• Before disconnecting the charging system from the air condi‐
tioning system, ensure that the process has been completed
so that no refrigerant can escape into the atmosphere.
• Once the purified refrigerant from the charging system has
been transferred to an external compressed-gas cylinder,
close the hand shut-off valves at the cylinder and charging
system.
• Do not expose the charging system to moisture or use it in a
wet environment.
• Disconnect from power supply before performing service work
on the charging system.
• An extension cable should not normally be used because it
can increase the fire hazard. If the use of an extension cable
is unavoidable, the minimum cross-section should be 2.5
mm2.
• In case of fire, remove external cylinder.
• Entrained oil from the air conditioning system drawn off by the
suction unit into the measurement vessel supplied is subse‐
quently to be transferred to a sealable container, as it contains
a small quantity of refrigerant which must not be released into
the environment.
• Following shutdown, the air conditioner service station must
be secured to stop it rolling away.
