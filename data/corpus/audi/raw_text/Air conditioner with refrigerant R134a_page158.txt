♦ The air conditioner compressors fitted at the start of production
are manufactured by „Denso“ (type „6 SEU 14“) for vehicles
with 4 and 6-cyl. engine and type „7 SEU 17“ for vehicles with
8-cyl. engine). Different makes of air conditioner compressor
may also be fitted at a later date ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue

♦ The Audi RS 5 is fitted with a condenser with a smaller internal
volume. The capacity for this vehicle is therefore lower than
for the other vehicles of this series ⇒ Electronic parts cata‐
