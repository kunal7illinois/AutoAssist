3 Brake fluid
3.1 General notes
Brake fluid is hygroscopic, i.e. it has the tendency to absorb water
and moisture from the atmosphere
The boiling point decreases as the water content increases, which
means a considerable rise in brake fluid temperature can lead to
formation of vapour bubbles and reduced braking effect.
The colour of the brake fluid becomes darker over the course of
time. This is caused by a normal chemical reaction and is not an
indication of the condition of the fluid.
WARNING
Rubber parts of brake system (sleeves, seals) are not com‐
patible with mineral oil, fuel and cleaning agents. Even minute
quantities coming into contact with a sleeve or seal will affect
the component and could impair brake operation.
