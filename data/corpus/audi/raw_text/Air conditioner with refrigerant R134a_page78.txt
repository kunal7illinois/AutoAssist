Note
♦ The design of the receiver on the Audi A3 and Audi TT differs
depending on the condenser manufacturer. The Audi TT with
5-cyl. engine is fitted for example with a different type of con‐
denser to vehicles with a 4 or 6-cyl. engine. This condenser
features an integrated receiver for example. The integrated
receiver contains a dryer cartridge which is currently not al‐
ways available as a replacement part. On vehicles fitted with
this condenser, it may therefore be necessary to replace the
entire condenser after rectifying any problems ⇒ Electronic
parts catalogue and ⇒ Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 .
♦ In the case of condensers with an integrated receiver / dryer
cartridge which cannot be renewed separately or which are
not available separately, the condenser is to be replaced after
flushing (together with the built-in dryer cartridge) ⇒ Heating,
air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
