Audi TT 2007 ➤
Running gear, front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive - Edition 08.2010
Note
♦ It is not possible to obtain more detailed readings specifying
the exact degree of impairment of damping effect.
♦ A forecast of the remaining service life is not permissible.
♦ Test results will be falsified if the suspension contacts the
bump stops when the readings are taken.
The following values apply only to tests conducted on the test
equipment listed above. If the stated values are exceeded, the
shock absorber action has deteriorated to such an extent that re‐
placement is recommended.
Example:
Maximum value = 70
♦ a = higher than 70: unsatisfactory damping effect
♦ a = lower than 70: satisfactory damping effect
Maximum values „a“ in mm
Note
♦ If the reading is higher than the maximum value „a“ listed in
the table, the damping effect is unsatisfactory ⇒ renew the
shock absorber.
♦ If the reading is lower than the maximum value „a“ listed in the
table, the damping effect is satisfactory ⇒ the shock absorber
does not have to be renewed.
Front axle Damping effect
Inadequate Adequate
Standard running gear (1BA) a = Greater than 60 a = Less than 60
Sports running gear (1BV) a = Greater than 60 a = Less than 60
Sports running gear (1BD) a = Greater than 60 a = Less than 60
Rear axle Damping effect
Inadequate Adequate
Standard running gear a = Greater than a = Less than
(1BA) 60 60
Sports running gear (1BV) a = Greater than a = Less than
60 60
Sports running gear (1BD) a = Greater than a = Greater
60 than 60
Vehicles with Audi magnetic ride (AMR) - electronic damping
control
Note
These values apply only when the test mode is activated
⇒ page 6 (in test mode, a diode flashes in the shock absorber
damping adjustment button -E387- ⇒ page 45 ).
