Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
If the tyre and wheel are mounted in an unfavourable position, this
can lead to the maximum permissible tolerance for the wheel with
the tyre being exceeded.
The table shows the maximum permissible tolerances for a wheel
with mounted tyre.
Tolerances for radial and lateral run-out of disc wheel with tyre:
Disc wheel with tyre Radial run-out Lateral run-out
All versions 0.8 mm 0.9 mm
6.8 Checking radial and lateral run-out of
wheels and tyres on V.A.G 1435
Checking lateral run-out:
– Preload dial gauge about 2 mm.
– Apply dial gauge to sidewall of the tyre as shown in illustration.
– Slowly rotate the wheel.
– Note the smallest and the largest dial readings.
Note
If the difference is greater than 1.3 mm, the lateral run-out is too
great.
In this case, you can reduce lateral run-out by matching the tyre
⇒ page 50 .
You can disregard extreme readings on the dial gauge which are
due to small irregularities in the rubber.
Checking radial run-out:
– Preload dial gauge about 2 mm.
– Apply dial gauge to running surface of the tyre as shown in
illustration.
– Slowly rotate the wheel.
– Note the smallest and the largest dial readings.
Note
If the difference is greater than 1 mm, the radial run-out is too
great.
In this case, you can reduce radial run-out by matching the tyre
⇒ page 50 .
6.9 Checking radial and lateral run-out on
wheel
– Mount the wheel on the wheel balancer.
– Use workshop equipment VAS 5271.
– Preload dial gauge about 2 mm.
– Slowly rotate the wheel.
