– Apply retaining pin -T10303- to seat of clutch end cover as
illustrated.
– Install multiple clutch in clutch bell housing (turn and move up
and down as required), at the same time keeping the drive
plate pressed into the outer plate carrier with both thumbs
-arrows-.
Note
Do not allow the multiple clutch to drop into the inner plate carrier.
– Have a second mechanic hold the retaining pin -T10303- as
illustrated until the clutch end cover is installed.
Note
The multiple clutch must not be turned from this point onwards,
as this would turn the retaining pin -T10303- out of position.
– Check whether the projecting lug -arrow- on the drive plate is
positioned between the colour-marked splines on the outer
plate carrier.
– If no marking is provided, use waterproof pen to mark position
of drive plate in relation to outer rim of outer plate carrier as
illustrated so it can be re-fitted in the same position.
Note
When re-assembling, the lug on the drive plate must be located
again at this marked position.
