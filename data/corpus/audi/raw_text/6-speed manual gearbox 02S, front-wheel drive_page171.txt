Determining thickness of shim
The specified bearing preload is obtained by adding a constant
preload figure (0.14 mm) to the measured value obtained (0.36
mm) and the thickness of the shim installed (0.65 mm).
Example:
Shim installed 0.65 mm
+ Measured value 0.36 mm
+ Preload (constant value) 0.14 mm
Thickness of shim 1.15 mm
