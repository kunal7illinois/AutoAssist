A combination of a tyre with rim protector, a steel rim and a full-
size wheel cover can lead to the loss of the wheel cover while the
vehicle is in motion. The wheel cover becomes unseated due to
the flexing of the tyre.
WARNING
When fitting tyres on steel rims, make sure not to use tyres
which have rim protectors.
The illustration shows the inadmissible combination of steel rim,
full-size wheel cover and a tyre with rim protector.
