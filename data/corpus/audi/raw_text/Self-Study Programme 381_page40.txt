Wheels and tyres
Operation and displays
The teach-in process is performed once after the
SET key is pressed for the low tyre pressure indica-
tor. During the next trip, the control unit saves the
measured wheel speeds and the vibration charac-
teristics of the wheels in various vehicle operating
states. The vehicle operating states are basically
defined by the following parameters: vehicle speed,
steering angle, transverse acceleration and yaw
velocity. These teach-in values subsequently make
up the target data which is used for monitoring.
After approximately 10 minutes of driving, it is
already possible to detect a breakdown (rapid loss
of pressure) . Approximately 60 minutes of driving
are required to detect diffusion loss (slow loss of
pressure).
