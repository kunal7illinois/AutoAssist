TT RS 2012 ➤
Generic Scan Tool - Edition 07.2011
• Coolant Temperature at least 80° C.
Function
Throttle valve operation occurs by an electric motor Throttle Drive
for Electronic Power Control (EPC) -G186- in the Throttle Valve
Control Module - J338- . It is operated by the Engine Control
Module (ECM) -J623- and the Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor
1 -G79- / Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor 2 -G185- .
The Throttle Valve Control Module -J338- is made up of the fol‐
lowing components:
♦ Throttle Drive for Electronic Power Control (EPC) -G186-
♦ Throttle Drive Angle Sensor 1 for Electronic Power Control
(EPC) -G187-
♦ Throttle Drive Angle Sensor 2 for Electronic Power Control
(EPC) -G188-
The Throttle Valve Control Module -J338- cannot be serviced
separately and must be serviced as a unit.
Test procedure
– Perform a preliminary check to verify the customers complaint.
Refer to ⇒ “3.1 Preliminary Check”, page 8
Start diagnosis
– Connect the scan tool.
– Switch ignition ON.
– Using the scan tool, check the throttle valve position (absolute)
at idle stop:
Diagnostic text Specified value
Throttle valve position (abso‐
lute)
• Idle stop 3.0 to 25.0%
– Slowly depress the accelerator pedal to Wide Open Throttle
(WOT) stop while observing the percentage display. The per‐
centage display must increase uniformly.
– Using the scan tool, check the throttle valve position (absolute)
at Wide Open Throttle (WOT) stop:
Diagnostic text Specified value
Throttle valve position (abso‐
lute)
• Wide Open Throttle (WOT) 84.0 to 97.0%
stop
– Switch ignition OFF.
If the specified values are not obtained:
– Remove the Throttle Valve Control Module -J338 - far enough
so that the electrical connector terminals are reached.
– Disconnect the Throttle Valve Control Module -J338- electrical
harness connector.
Checking resistance
– Using a multimeter, check the Throttle Drive for Electronic
Power Control (EPC) -G186- at the Throttle Valve Control
Module -J338- terminals 3 to 5 for resistance.
