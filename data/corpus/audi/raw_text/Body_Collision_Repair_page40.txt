12.1 Windshield Repair
Aside from replacing windshields, under certain conditions there
is the less expensive possibility of repairing a windshield that has
been damaged by a stone.
Tinted windshields, windshields with colored liners or insulated
glass (Audi A8, A6) can be repaired because the tint is created
with colored intermediate foil.
Repairing the windshield is preferred to replacing it under the fol‐
lowing conditions.
