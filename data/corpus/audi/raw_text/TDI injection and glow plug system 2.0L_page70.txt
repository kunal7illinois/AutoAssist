Installing
When installing, note the following:
Note
♦ Threads of new Lambda probes are already coated with as‐
sembly paste; the paste must not get into the slots on the probe
body.
♦ In the case of a used Lambda probe grease only the thread
with high-temperature paste. The paste must not get into the
slots on the Lambda probe body. For high-temperature paste
refer to ⇒ Parts catalogue .
♦ When installing, the Lambda probe wiring must always be re‐
attached at the same locations to prevent it from coming into
contact with the exhaust pipe.
• Tightening torques: refer to Lambda probe - overview
