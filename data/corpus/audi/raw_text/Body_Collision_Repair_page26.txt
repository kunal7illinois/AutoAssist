The distance of the spot-weld surfaces to each other should not
be greater than 1 mm. If necessary, the adhesive surfaces must
be prepared.
The welding current must not be increased for spot-weld bonding
operations. The pre-press period must be extended to approx. 30
- 50 cycles because of the displacement of the adhesive. The
fumes produced must be exhausted.
7.3 Repair Methods for Replacing Parts
Adhesive DA 001 730 A should be used in connection with com‐
pressed-air adhesive gun -V.A.G 2005- as replacement for spot-
weld adhesive.
Instructions for use ⇒ page 21 .
For simultaneous bonding and welding, the procedures are dif‐
ferentiated according to the type of weld (spot weld, gas-shielded
weld) as follows:
Straight-line spot weld and bonding ⇒ page 20
Gas-shielded welding and bonding (if spot welding is not possible)
⇒ page 20

7.3.1 Straight-line spot weld and bonding
With spot welding and bonding, the entire area of spot welds and
bonding is replaced when making repairs, as in production.
With welding problems, e.g. there is a 3-layer panel connection
and only the outer panel is replaced, the repair spot weld should
be placed on the “old” spot weld.
7.3.2 Gas-shielded welding and bonding (if
spot welding is not possible)
If an adhesion area is not accessible with a straight-line spot
welding device, the area is welded with a gas-shielded arc plug
weld seam.
In this case, adhesive is done without in order to main t a in the
welding bead. The gas-shielded arc plug weld distance is 15 mm.
7.3.3 Gas-shielded welding
SG 2 welding wire is suitable all steel types.
