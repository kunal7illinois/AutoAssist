6-speed manual gearbox 02Q, four-wheel drive - Edition 10.2009
– Set up measuring tools and secure with bolt -arrow- to clutch
housing.
– Set dial gauge -VAS 6080- (3 mm measuring range) to “0” with
1 mm preload.
– Loosen clutch housing/gearbox housing securing bolts diag‐
onally until output shaft is free to move in gearbox housing.
– Read off play on gauge and note reading (example: 0.14 mm).
Note
If no play is indicated on the dial gauge when the clutch housing/
gearbox housing securing bolts are loosened, fit a 1.95 mm shim
(part number -084 409 383 AS- ), or if necessary a 2.20 mm shim
(part number -084 409 383 BD- ) for performing the measure‐
ment.
Determining thickness of shim
The specified bearing preload is attained by subtracting the meas‐
ured value (0.14 mm) from the inserted shim (1.70 m m ) and
adding a constant value for preload (0.20 mm).
Example:
Inserted shim 1.70 mm
– Measured value 0.14 mm
+ Preload (constant value) 0.20 mm
Thickness of shim 1.76 mm
– Select a shim of the required thickness from the table. For part
number refer to ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
The following shims are available:
Thickness of shims in mm
1.45 1.70 1.95 2.20
1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25
1.55 1.80 2.05
1.60 1.85 2.10
1.65 1.90 2.15
The exact shim thickness required can be obtained by combining
shims of different thicknesses.
– Detach gearbox housing and pull tapered roller bearing outer
race out of gearbox housing.
A - Counter-support , e.g. -Kukko 22/2-
B - Internal puller 46 ... 58 mm , e.g. -Kukko 21/7-
– Remove inserted shim (1.70 mm thick) from gearbox housing.
