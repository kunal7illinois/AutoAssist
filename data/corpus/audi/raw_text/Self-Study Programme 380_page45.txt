Outlet temperature sensor
For the driver side, one outlet temperature sensor is
installed in the air duct of the chest vent and in the
footwell duct. For the front passenger side, only the
outlet temperature sensor is installed in the footwell

duct.
The Climatronic control unit J255 evaluates the
outlet temperature sensor in dependence on the air
distribution and determines from this the actual
outlet temperature.
If an outlet temperature sensor is found to be faulty,
the temperature control is generally not
deactivated. Depending on the operating mode
(Heat or Cool) and the side of the vehicle on which
the fault occurs (the front passenger side has only
one outlet temperature sensor, in the footwell duct), 380_050
the Climatronic control unit J255 decides whether
the temperature control can remain active or has to
be deactivated.
If air distribution is in the DEFROST setting, the
outlet temperature control is deactivated.

The cover in the front passenger footwell is fixed in place with two wing bolts and the pollen filter air duct
cover is located in position using a slide mechanism.
The combined filter has two predetermined bending points.This makes the filter easy to bend and simplifies
installation of the filter into the air conditioner.
