Audi TT 2007 ➤
4-cylinder direct petrol injection engine (2.0 ltr. 4-valve turbo), mechanics - Edition 11.2006
– Fill reservoir of cooling system charge unit -VAS 6096- with at
least 8 litres of premixed coolant (based on recommended ra‐
tio):
♦ G12+ (40%) and water (60%) for frost protection to -25 °C
♦ G12+ (50%) and water (50%) for frost protection to -35 °C
♦ G12+ (60%) and water (40%) for frost protection to -40 °C
– Screw adapter for cooling system tester -V.A.G 1274/8- onto
coolant expansion tank.
– Fit cooling system charge unit -VAS 6096- onto adapter for
cooling system tester -V.A.G 1274/8- .
– Run vent hose -1- into a small container -2-. (The vented air
draws along a small amount of coolant, which should be col‐
lected.)
– Close the two valves -A- and -B- (levers at right angles to di‐
rection of flow).
– Connect hose -3- to compressed air.
• Pressure: 6 ... 10 bar
– Open valve -B- (lever in direction of flow).
The suction jet pump generates a partial vacuum in the cooling
system.
• The needle on the gauge should move into the green zone.
– Additionally open valve -A- briefly (lever in direction of flow) so
that the hose of cooling system charge unit -VAS 6096- is filled
with coolant.
– Close valve -A- again.
– Leave valve -B- open for another 2 minutes.
The suction jet pump will continue generating a vacuum in the
cooling system.
• The needle on the gauge should remain in the green zone.
– Close valve -B-.
• The needle on the gauge should stop in the green zone. The
vacuum level in the cooling system is then sufficient for sub‐
sequent filling.
If the needle does not reach the green area, repeat the process.
If the vacuum level drops, there is a leak in the cooling system.
– Detach compressed air hose.
– Open valve -A-.
The vacuum in the cooling system causes the coolant to be drawn
out of the cooling system charge unit -VAS 6096- ; the cooling
system is then filled.
