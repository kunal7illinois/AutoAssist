Infotainment
Telephone
– Operation of the optional factory-fitted mobile phone adapter with navigation
system speller
– Mute function for handsfree telephone: If the mobile phone adapter is
factory-fitted, muting is via the infotainment CAN bus. A direct wiring plug
contact is provided for retrofit solutions. Retrofit solutions cannot be
operated with the navigation system.
– LF input for handsfree telephone: when the radio is switched on, the vehicle
loudspeakers are used as loudspeakers for the handsfree telephone.
Sound
– Integrated 2 x 20W amplifier
– Auxiliary sound amplifier connected
– Connectivity for optional auxiliary BOSE sound amplifier
– Speed-dependent volume control (GALA) via infotainment CAN bus
– Basic sound setting via body version coding (A4 saloon/Avant/Cabrio, A3, TT).
Service
– Comfort coding: after the power supply to the radio has been disconnected, it
is not necessary to enter the 4-digit PIN if the radio is restored to operation in
the same vehicle.
– Diagnosis via CAN bus (TT, A3 8P) or L-wire (A4 8E). The scope of diagnosis
(data blocks, adaption, coding, etc.) is basically the same as for diagnosis of
the Navigation plus system (RNS-E).
– The system software can be updated as required with a flash CD.
Technical variants
In addition to the Audi TT Coupé ‘07, the navigation system will in future also be used in other Audi models
equipped with the infotainment CAN bus. The necessary adjustments are basically the shape of the front trim
panel, the CAN communication and the diagnosis path (CAN, L-wire, etc.)
