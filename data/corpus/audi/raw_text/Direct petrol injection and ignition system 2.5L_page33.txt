– Turn round assembly sleeve -T10133/6- and slide combustion
chamber ring seal into groove.
Note
The combustion chamber ring seal is widened when it is pushed
onto the injector. After pushing it on, it therefore has to be com‐
pressed again. This is done in two stages, as described below.
– Push calibration sleeve -T10133/7- onto injector as far as it will
go and simultaneously turn it slightly (approx. 180°).
– Pull calibration sleeve -T10133/7- off again by turning it in the
opposite direction.
– Push calibration sleeve -T10133/8- onto injector as far as it will
go and simultaneously turn it slightly (approx. 180°).
– Pull calibration sleeve -T10133/8- off again by turning it in the
opposite direction.
– Before installing new injector -1-, lubricate new O-ring -3- light‐
ly with clean engine oil.
Note
The combustion chamber ring seal -8- must not be lubricated.
