Special tools and workshop

♦ Tensioning strap -T10038-
♦ Support -T10149-
All bolts on running gear components with bonded rubber bushes
must always be tightened with suspension in the unladen position.
Bonded rubber bushes can only be turned to a limited extent.
Therefore, before tightening the bolts, suspension components
with bonded rubber bushes must be brought into a position cor‐
responding to the normal position of the unladen vehicle while
driving (unladen position).
Otherwise, the bush would be subject to torsion loading and its
service life would be shortened.
This position can be simulated on the lifting platform by raising
the axle on one side with engine and gearbox jack -V.A.G 1383
A- and support -T10149- .
