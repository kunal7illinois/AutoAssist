Note
♦ If several wires have to be repaired, make sure crimp connec‐
tors are not directly adjacent to one another. Offset the crimp
connectors slightly to restrict the size of the wiring harness.
♦ If the repair location was previously wrapped, yellow adhesive
tape must be wrapped around this location again on comple‐
tion of repair.
♦ If necessary, secure the repaired wiring harness with a cable
tie to prevent rattling noises when the vehicle is driven.
