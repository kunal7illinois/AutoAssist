1.11 Replacement parts
In order to keep the number of different parts to a minimum, many
replacement parts are only supplied as a “basic version”.
Examples:
• Roof for Audi A6 2005 ▸ without holes for roof rail
We recommend that the workshop makes its own “templates”
from damaged parts for such cases.
Example: Roof for Audi A6 2005 ▸ holes for roof rail:
• Use pneumatic sabre saw -V.A.G 1523 A- to cut side section
out of "old" roof, paying attention to significant contours, e.g.
part of recess (rain channel). Deburr cut edges and protect
with fabric-backed adhesive tape.
Place template in position before painting and allow for material
thickness of template when marking drill holes.
Check new replacement parts e.g. doors, bonnet and boot lid/
tailgate or wing panel for transportation damage before passing
them on to the paintshop. This avoids a second painting operation
which would become necessary if transportation or other damage
was not noticed until a later stage.
