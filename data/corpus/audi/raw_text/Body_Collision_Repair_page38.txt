11.4.1 Gas-shielded welding on galvanized
panels
To produce good repair welds, observe the following notes:
♦ The amperage at welding transformer must be increased.
♦ At the same time, the wire feed must be readjusted because
increasing the voltage alone generates a large electric arc
(lower fusion penetration, porous seam construction).
♦ Use cylindrical gas nozzles instead of conical (splashes on a
gas nozzle that is too narrow causes formation of pores).
♦ Direct burner bout 12 cm over welding material in a neutral
angle position up to 10°.
♦ Use softest wire quality possible.
♦ CO2 as well as mixed gasses can be used as inert gas.
