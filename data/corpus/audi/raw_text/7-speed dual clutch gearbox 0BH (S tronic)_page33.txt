♦ Removal wedge -3409-
♦ The selector lever lock solenoid -N110- locks the selector lever
in position „P“. The selector lever can then only be shifted out
of position „P“ when the ignition is on / the engine is running,
the brake pedal is depressed and the button on the selector
lever handle is pressed ⇒ page 30 .
♦ In the event of a fault in the power supply to the selector lever
lock solenoid (dischar g ed battery or defective fuse) or if the
solenoid is defective, the selector lever cannot be shifted out
of position „P“. The vehicle cannot be moved because the
parking lock is engaged.
In this case:
– Check fuses ⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical fault finding
and Fitting locations.
– Check battery voltage ⇒ Electrical system; General informa‐
tion; Rep. gr. 27 .
If fault finding has not been successful and selector lever can still
not be shifted from „P“ the solenoid can be released manually.
However, if the selector lever is then moved back to „P“ it will
remain locked in position „P“ once again.
Procedure
– Unclip selector lever boot on both sides using removal wedge
-3409- and lift it off -arrows-.
– Pull selector lever boot up and over handle.
Note
The selector lever handle does not have to be removed in order
to operate the manual release mechanism.
