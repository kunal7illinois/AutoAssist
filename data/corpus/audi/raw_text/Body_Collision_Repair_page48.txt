14 Contact Corrosion!
Contact corrosion may occur if unsuitable connecting elements
(bolts, nuts, washers and so on) are used.
For this reason, only connecting elements with a special surface
coating are installed (Dacromet). These elements are distinguish‐
ed by their greenish hue.
Furthermore, all rubber, plastic and adhesive materials used are
non-conductive.
If there is any doubt about the reusability of parts, always install
new replacement parts.

14.1 Note:
Only use genuine Audi replacement parts! They are tested and
aluminum-compatible.
Additional equipment must be approved by Audi of America!
Damage via contact corrosion is not covered by warranty!
