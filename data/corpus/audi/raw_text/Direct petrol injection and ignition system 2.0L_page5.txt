cleanliness
1.1 General notes on self-diagnosis
♦ The engine control unit has a self-diagnosis capability. Before
carrying out repairs and fault finding the fault memory must be
interrogated. The vacuum hoses and connections must also
be checked (unmetered air).
♦ Fuel hoses in engine compartment must only be secured with
spring-type clips. Clamping-type or screw-type clips must not
be used.
♦ A voltage of at least 11.5 V is required for proper operation of
the electrical components.
♦ Do not use sealants containing silicone. Particles of silicone
drawn into the engine will not be burnt in the engine and will
damage the Lambda probe.
♦ The vehicles are fitted with a crash/fuel shut-off system. This
system is designed to reduce the risk of a vehicle fire after a
crash by deactivating the fuel pump via the fuel pump relay.
♦ At the same time, this system also improves the engine's start‐
ing performance. When the driver's door is opened, the fuel
pump is activated for 2 seconds in order to build up pressure
in the fuel system ⇒ page 2 .
