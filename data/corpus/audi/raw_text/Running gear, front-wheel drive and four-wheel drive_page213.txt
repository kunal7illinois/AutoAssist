9.4 Removing and installing coil spring
When renewing or performing repairs on the rear coil springs, the
rubber spring seat with zinc contact surface must be replaced with
a new spring seat of the all-rubber type ⇒ Item 3 (page 202) . If
the all-rubber spring seat is already installed it does not have to
be renewed. For correct version refer to ⇒ Electronic parts cata‐
logue . When installing the coil spring, ensure that the repainted
section is at the top. This part is dull and usually slightly thicker
than the rest of the spring. In many cases paint runs are visible,
or possibly a drop of paint on the second coil.
