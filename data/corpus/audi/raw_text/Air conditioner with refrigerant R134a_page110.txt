Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
Depending on the engine, the air conditioner compressor is driven
by different components (belt or drive shaft). To protect these
components and the engine, the pulley or the air conditioner com‐
pressor drive unit is fitted with an overload safeguard which is
tripped if the air conditioner compressor is not operating smoothly

7.1.2 Checking pressures
♦ Heed the test conditions ⇒ page 104 .
– Switch off ignition.
– Connect air conditioner service station ⇒ page 99 .
– Read pressures off pressure gauges; there are two possible
results:
♦ The pressure in the refrigerant circuit is lower than indicated
in the table.
♦ The pressure in the refrigerant circuit corresponds to that in‐
dicated in the table or is higher.
Ambient temperature (in de‐ Pressure in refrigerant circuit in
grees centigrade) bar
+15 °C 3,9
+20 °C 4,7
+25 °C 5,6
+30 °C 6,7
+35 °C 7,8
+40 °C 9,1
+45 °C 10,5
Note
♦ The temperature of the refrigerant circuit components should
be equal to ambient temperature (the pressure will deviate
from the values in the table if individual components of the
refrigerant circuit are warmer or colder).
♦ At absolute pressure, 0 bar corresponds to an absolute vac‐
uum. The normal ambient pressure corresponds to 1 bar
absolute. On the scales of most pressure gauges, 0 bar cor‐
responds to an absolute pressure of 1 bar (can be seen from
-1 bar mark below 0).
♦ On vehicles with a high-pressure sender -G65- or refrigerant
pressure and temperature sender -G395- for which the meas‐
ured pressure is displayed in the measured value block, the
pressure measured should coincide with the values in the ta‐
ble ⇒ Vehicle diagnostic tester ( „self-diagnosis“ or „guided
fault-finding“ function for air conditioner) and ⇒ Heating, air
conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87
(vehicle-specific workshop manual).
♦ Pressure may be given in various units: 1 MPa (megapascal)
corresponds to 10 bar gauge pressure or 145 psi; 1 bar ab‐
solute pressure corresponds to 0 bar gauge pressure, which
is roughly equivalent to atmospheric pressure.
