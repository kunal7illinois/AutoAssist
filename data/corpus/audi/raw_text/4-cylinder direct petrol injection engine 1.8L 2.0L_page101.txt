Idler gear - tightening sequence
Caution
Always renew idler gear. If this is not done, there is no back‐
lash, which causes engine damage.
The new idler gear has a special lubricant coating, which wears
off after a short running period and thus automatically creates
the specified backlash.
– Secure with new bolt as follows:
1. Tighten with torque wrench initially to 10 Nm.
2. Turn idler gear.
Idler gear must be without play; otherwise loosen bolt and tighten
again.
3. Tighten with torque wrench to 25 Nm.
4. Use rigid wrench to turn 90° further.
