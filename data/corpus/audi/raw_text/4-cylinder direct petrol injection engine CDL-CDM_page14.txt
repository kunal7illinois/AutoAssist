sure in fuel system:
• The fuel pressure will decrease very quickly because the me‐
chanical high-pressure pump is no longer being supplied with
fuel from the fuel tank by the electric fuel pump.
– Switch off ignition as soon as fuel pressure has dropped to just
below 8 bar.
Note
Fuel pressure must not fall below 6 bar, otherwise the engine will
stall (this could damage the catalytic converter).
The fuel rail is still filled with fuel, however it is no longer under
high pressure.
WARNING
There is a risk of injury: avoid skin contact with fuel.
♦ Wear safety goggles and protective clothing when open‐
ing the fuel system.
♦ Before opening the high-pressur e section of the fuel sys‐
tem, place a clean cloth around the connection to catch
escaping fuel.
– Disconnect a fuel line connection without delay.
Note
The pressure will increase again due to the effect of residual heat
if the high-pressure system is not opened immediately.
