3 Exhaust gas recirculation system
Exhaust gas recirculation system
♦ To improve exhaust emission values, exhaust gas is recircu‐
lated to the combustion chambers, thus reducing the combus‐
tion chamber temperature.
♦ The exhaust gas recirculation system is activated by the en‐
gine control unit -J623- via the exhaust gas recirculation valve
-N18- and the exhaust gas recirculation potentiometer -
G212- .
♦ The exhaust gas recirculation is switc h ed off after approx. 2
minutes at idling speed.
♦ Restart engine or briefly increase engine speed above 1500
rpm when longer checks are necessary. Then repeat meas‐
urement.
Cooling system for exhaust gas recirculation system
♦ To further improve the exhaust emission values, the exhaust
gas recirculation system is equipped with a cooler that is con‐
nected into the engine cooling system.
♦ Under certain operating conditions, the flow of exhaust gas
that is recirculated to the combustion chamber is routed via
this cooler. The exhaust gas temperature is thereby reduced,
further lowering the combustion temperature and improving
the exhaust emission values.
♦ The engine control unit -J623- determines when the recircu‐
lated exhaust gas is routed via the cooler. The control unit
actuates a vacuum unit via the exhaust gas recirculation cool‐
er change-over valve -N345- , and the vacuum unit in turn
operates the change-over flap for the exhaust gas recircula‐
tion cooler.
