4.6.1 Tracing refrigerant circuit leaks with
electronic leak detector (e.g. V.A.G
1796)
Proceed as follows with a completely empty refrigerant circuit to
avoid allowing more refrigerant than is absolutely necessary for
leak detection to escape into the environment:
– Evacuate the refrigerant circuit using the air conditioner serv‐
ice station ⇒ page 49 .
Note
♦ If evacuation already reveals a major leak, this is to be located
and eliminated as described ⇒ page 49 .
♦ Continue as follows if evacuation does not reveal any leakage
or if the leakage is so slight that it is not possible to determine
the leakage location.
– Pour roughly 100 g of refrigerant into the evacuated refrigerant
circuit.
Detecting leaks:
– Start up leak detector in line with relevant operating instruc‐
tions.
– Always hold test probe beneath suspected leak.
Depending on the model, leak detection is indicated by an in‐
crease in clicking rate or a warning tone (refer to operating in‐
structions for leak detector).
Note
♦ Currents of air quickly disperse refrigerant gas. Draughts must
therefore be avoided during leak detection.
♦ Refrigerant gas is heavier than air and therefore sinks to a
lower level at the exit location.
