Direct shift gearbox 02E, front-wheel drive - Edition 12.2006
• The gear oil that has collected in the overflow pipe -arrow 2-
will drain off first.
Note
Regardless of the gear oil level, a certain amount of gear oil will
always drain off.
• The gear oil level is correct if a small amount of oil drains out
when the oil temperature is between 35 and 45 °C (the oil level
rises as the oil temperature continues to increase).
Note
♦ Every 30 seconds a small surge of oil will come out of the
overflow pipe, regardless of the oil level (this is caused by the
intermittent supply of cooling oil to the multiple clutch). This
surge of oil is not relevant when checking the gear oil level and
can be disregarded.
♦ Do not re-use drained-off gear oil.
♦ Check the gear oil temperature on vehicle diagnostic, testing
and information system -VAS 5051B- while filling the gearbox
with oil. Stop filling and allow the gearbox to cool down if the
temperature exceeds 45 °C.
