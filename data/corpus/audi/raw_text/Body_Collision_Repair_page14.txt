General InformationBody Repair, Body Collision Repair - Edition 05.2007
WARNING
Because toxic galvanized oxide develops in welding emissions
when welding galvanized sheet steel panels, there must be
good workplace ventilation and flue-gas removal through ap‐
propriate means, e.g. welding emission exhaust system -V.A.G
1586 A- .
2.9 Removing Remaining Material
If the damaged body piece is removed roughly according to the
separating cuts in the applicable repair manual, e.g with pressure
hammer -V.A.G 1577- or body repair saw -V.A.G 1523 A- , drill
out most spot weld connections with spot weld remover -V.A.G
1731- .
In addition, we recommend the degree sander -V.A.G 1529- as
well as an angle sander to remove the weld connections that can‐
not be removed with the spot weld remover.
2.10 New Parts
New parts which are not accessible from the inside after a repair,
e.g. side members, should, to prevent corrosion, be pre-painted
in the color of the vehicle before being welded in. Here it is rec‐
ommended to mask the welding flanges.
2.11 Replacement Parts
In many cases, replacement parts are delivered only in the “basic
version” for parts reduction.
Examples:
• Audi 100 from MY 1991 roof without roof rail holes.
In these cases, we recommend that the workshop creates “pat‐
terns” from damaged parts.
Example: from MY Audi 100 1991 roof rail holes:
• Cut out side part from roof with the body repair saw -V.A.G
1523 A- , observing prominent contours, e.g. a part of the de‐
pression (rain gutter), when doing so. Deburr cut edges and
protect with fabric-reinforced adhesive tape.
Apply patterns before painting and allow for the material strength
of the pattern when marking the bore holes.
Check new replacement parts, such as doors, panels or fenders
for transport damage before sending to paint shop. This prevents
double painting, if transport or accident damage to the vehicle is
noticed during assembly.
