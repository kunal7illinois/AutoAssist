2.4.2 Checking heated seats
Note
♦ Situations preventing activation of the driver's/front passeng‐
er's seat heating (short circuit in connection to seat heating
element, open circuit in power supply to air conditioner oper‐
ating unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- etc.) are stored as
faults in the air conditioner operating unit, Climatronic control
unit -J255- ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function of vehicle diag‐
nostic, testing and information system VAS 5051.
♦ Che c king of heated seat actuation is described in the air con‐
ditioner guided fault-finding routine ⇒ "Guided fault-finding"
function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and information system
VAS 5051 .
♦ If the voltage measured at the onboard supply control unit -
J519- at terminal “30” drops below a value stored in -J519- ,
the seat heating power is reduced (currently to approx. 50 %)
or the heating function is completely deactivated to relieve the
load on the alternator -C- . The air conditioner operating unit,
Climatronic control unit -J255- reduces the actuation duty cy‐
cle from 100 % to less than 90 ... 0 % ⇒ "Guided fault-finding"
function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and information system
VAS 5051 .
♦ The measured value block of the air conditioner operating unit,
Climatronic control unit -J255- shows that the front seat heat‐
ing is being actuated or indicates why there is no actuation in
spite of a corresponding request ⇒ "Guided fault-finding"
function of vehicle diagnostic, testing and information system
VAS 5051 .
