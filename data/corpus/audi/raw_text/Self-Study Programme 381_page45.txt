Design and function
In the Audi TT the rear tyre pressure monitor aerial
R96 is integrated in the tyre pressure monitor con-
trol unit J502.The control unit is fitted in the low
tyre pressure indicator behind the dash panel
insert. In the case of the tyre pressure monitoring
system, communication with the vehicle periphery
via the convenience CAN bus.

The aerial receives the radio signals from tyre pres-
sure sensors G222-G226. The sensors operate at a
radio frequency of 315MHz. The sensors are identi-
cal in design and function to those on the Audi A6.
A new feature is the use of the valve body as a
transmitter antenna. The valve body and sensor can
no longer be separated. As with the current models
A4, A6 and Q7, the sensors do not start to transmit
until the wheels being to turn. To meet the country-
specific statutory requirements, the battery service
life is 10 years. The tyre pressure of the spare wheel
is not monitored. When the customer orders a full-
size spare wheel, the sensor is already installed in

the wheel if the vehicle is equipped with a tyre pres-
sure monitoring system.
The E492 button used in the tyre pressure monitor-
ing system is identical to the button used by the low
tyre pressure indicator. Pressing the button displays
the actual tyre pressures as new target pressures.
As with the low tyre pressure indicator, the button is
connected to the control unit by discrete lines.
