5.7 Adjusting automatic anti-dazzle interior
mirror -Y7- for right-hand drive or left-
hand drive vehicles
It is necessary to adjust the mirror to right-hand or left-hand drive
if:
♦ A new automatic anti-dazzle interior mirror -Y7- is installed.
Note
♦ On recently manufactured automatic anti-dazzle interior mir‐
rors -Y7- , the sensor for the magnetic deflection zone is no
longer fitted in the mirror base, but in the mirror housing. Only
these mirrors can and MUST be adjusted to right-hand or left-
hand drive.
♦ Recently manufactured automatic anti-dazzle interior mirrors
-Y7- can be identified by pressing and holding button -2- for
longer than 12 seconds; „L“ or „A“ will appear on the display
of these mirrors.
– Press and hold button -2- for 12 to 15 seconds until display
shows „L“ (for left-hand drive vehicles) or „A“ (for right-hand
drive vehicles).
– Press button -2- again briefly to change the setting for right-
hand or left-hand drive.
– After a short while, the display will automatically show „C“ (for
calibration). The digital compass must now be calibrated
⇒ page 31 .
– Make sure you switch the anti-dazzle function of the interior
mirror back on ⇒ page 30 after adjusting the mirror for right-
hand or left-hand drive.
