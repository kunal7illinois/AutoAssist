Fuel supply
The fuel system is basically adopted from the A3`04.
The fuel tanks differ from one another in terms of their shape, which is dependent on the vehicle's drive
concept.
They are made of HPPE (high-pressure polyethylene). To safeguard the fuel tank against destruction in the
event of an accident, it is mounted in front of the rear axle. Here it is fixed to the underbody by means of
ratchet straps. It is not necessary to disassemble the rear axle to remove the fuel tank. The front tank has
a capacity of 55 litres, the quattro tank 60 litres.The US spec quattro tank has a capacity of 55 litres, because
a different breather system is used due to the different statutory requirements which apply.
