Note
♦ Replacement restrictors with different holes are available (yel‐
low-coloured 1.54 mm, red-coloured 1.42 mm).
♦ Depending on manufacturer, colour of red restrictor may tend
more towards orange.
♦ To avoid altering the cooling output of the air conditioner, only
red-coloured restrictors are to be fitted.
♦ Different air conditioner compressors are fitted depending on
the model ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific
workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The condenser fitted on vehicles with a 10-cyl. TFSI engine
(Audi RS 6) has a smaller internal volume than the condenser
with other engines. For vehicles with a 10-cyl. TFSI engine the
refrigerant capacity is thus also slightly less than for other ve‐
hicles ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
