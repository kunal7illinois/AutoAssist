System components
Front axle wheel brake
The brake calipers are identical in design and
principle of operation to the brake calipers on the
Audi A3. A zinc-nickel coating is now applied. Brake
calipers are optionally available in a grey finish. The
brake discs for the 16" system have been adopted
from the Audi A3. The brake discs for the 17" system
are a modified version of the discs used on the Audi
A3. This change was necessary due to the modified
rim geometry of the SST wheels.
The Audi TT has new brake hoses with modified
holders on the swivel bearing compared to the Audi
A3.The 16" and 17" splash plates have been adopted
from the Audi A3. Break pad wear is measured in a
conventional fashion on the interior lining of the left
wheel brake. The 17" system is equipped with a
vibration damper. The damper is attached to the
brake caliper by the lower fastening bolt.
