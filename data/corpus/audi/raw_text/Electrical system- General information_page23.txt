4.1 Checking battery using battery tester
with printer -VAS 6161-
♦ When checking the battery using battery tester with printer -
VAS 6161- it is not necessary to disconnect the battery earth
cable.
♦ The battery tester with printer -VAS 6161- no longer puts the
battery under load, but works by measuring the dynamic con‐
ductivity. For this reason it is possible to perform several
measurements without re-charging the battery.
♦ No-load voltage measurement can be performed without de‐
lay.
♦ All types of battery are stored in the tester and they can be
updated.
♦ The battery bar code can be read off directly with the optionally
available 2D scanner.
♦ The integrated temperature sensor improves the quality of
measurements.
♦ Data can be stored on an SD card.
