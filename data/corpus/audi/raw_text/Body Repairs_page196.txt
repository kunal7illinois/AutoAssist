WARNING
The body consists of a combination of steel and aluminium
panels. In areas where the two materials meet, the aluminium
parts must be carefully covered and protected when grinding,
sawing, and welding etc. This prevents contact corrosion
caused by weld spatter and dust particles on the aluminium
sections.

moving the old part.
