4 Notes on disposal
4.1 Active environmental protection at the
factory
The disposal must, of course, already be taken into consideration
during production. At Audi the following measures are taken:
• Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer used, or are only
used to a limited extent, for instance in soft foam propellants
(e.g. for seat upholstery), in separating agents in the manu‐
facture of plastic parts and cleaning agents in the production
facilities.
• Use of solvent-free adhesives and production aids, thereby
considerably lowering emission levels (pollutant evapora‐
tions), as well as reducing odour nuisance and fogging on
glass surfaces
• Use of recyclable materials for plastic parts such as:
• Bumper covers
• Dash panel
• Engine cover panel and the like
• Items already being manufactured from recycled plastic:
• Whe e l housing liners
• Luggage compartment floor covers
• Soundproofing mats etc.
• Use of materials suitable for recycling and reduction of the
number of different types
• Designs suitable for recycling (simple removal)
4.2 Recycling means:
– Avoiding pollutants
– Reduction of refuse
– Saving raw materials
4.3 The basic rules for environmental pro‐
tection are:
Avoid ratherthan reduce
Reduce rather than recycle
Recycle rather than dispose
4.4 Recycling
As an important contribution to reducing the impact on the envi‐
ronment, certain plastic parts are made from reusable (recycla‐
ble) or already reprocessed -recycled- raw materials.
The recycling concept employed must be kept as simple as pos‐
sible, right down to the logistics for aftersales and the recycling
companies.
Voluntary measures taken to facilitate recycling
– The removal of the parts has already been simplified in the
way they are designed.
