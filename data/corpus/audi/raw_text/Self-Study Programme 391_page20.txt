Electrical convertible top control system
Components of the convertible top control system
The central element of the convertible top control system in the Audi TT Roadster is the convertible top
operation control unit J256.
It controls and monitors the automatic convertible top operating cycle and is responsible for diagnostics.
If the diagnostics detect faulty components or if the signals from the individual components involved in the
convertible top operating cycle fail are not received in time, the convertible top operating cycle is stopped.

To start the convertible top operating cycle, push
or pull the convertible top operating switch E137.

If the switch is released during the convertible top
operating cycle, the convertible top stops moving
immediately.
To resume convertible top operation in any
direction, actuate the switch again.
If the vehicle is travelling at a speed of between
6 and 50 kph, a short pull (< 0.5 seconds) of the

start fully automatic opening of the convertible top.
If the vehicle is travelling at faster than 50 kph, it is
no longer possible to start the convertible top
operating cycle.
The convertible top operating switch is located on
the vehicle's centre console.
