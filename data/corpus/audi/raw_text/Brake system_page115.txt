WARNING
♦ Do not under any circumstances allow brake fluid to come
into contact with fluids that contain mineral oils (e.g. oil,
petrol, cleaning agents). Mineral oils damage the plugs
and seals in the brake system.
♦ Brake fluid is poisonous and must NOT be sucked through
a hose with the mouth. On account of its corrosive effect
it must also not be allowed to come into contact with paint‐
work.
♦ Brake fluid is hygroscopic, i.e. it absorbs moisture from the
surrounding air, and should therefore always be stored in
airtight containers.
♦ Always observe the relevant environmental regulations for
disposal.
When topping up brake fluid with, for example, brake filling and
bleeding equipment -VAS 5234- or upgrade kit and extraction unit
-V.A.G 1869/4- , make sure the filling pressure does not exceed
1 bar.
The brake fluid pressure must be reduced to 1 bar on brake filling
and bleeding equipment ⇒ VAS 5234 or V.A.G 1869 operating
instructions .
Note
♦ Use only new brake fluid.
♦ Rinse off brake fluid spillages using plenty of water.
