Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.5.5 Air conditioning system pressure switch
-F129-
This pressure switch has 3 functions:
1. Switches the radiator fan up to the next speed setting in the
event of a pressure increase (approx. 16 bar) in the refrigerant
circuit.
2. Switches off the air conditioner in the event of excessive pres‐
sure (approx. 32 bar) caused for example by inadequate engine
cooling.
3. Switches off the air conditioner in the event of insufficient pres‐
sure (approx. 2 bar) caused for example by a loss of refrigerant.
Note
The air conditioning system pressure switch -F129- replaces the
high-pressure switch for air conditioning system -F23- , the low-
pressure switch for air conditioning system -F73- and the high-
pressure switch for magnetic clutch -F118- .
2.5.6 High-pressure sender -G65-
The high-pressure sender -G65- is fitted instead of the air condi‐
tioning system pressure switch -F129- or the refrigerant pressure
and temperature sender -G395- .
The refrigerant pressure and temperature sender -G395- ( „grey“
housing at present) and the high-pressure sender -G65- ( „black“
housing at present) currently only differ in terms of the housing
colour and attention is therefore to be paid to the correct assign‐
ment on replacement (part number ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue ).
As these two senders emit different signals, the relevant control
unit can only evaluate the signal to which it has been matched ⇒
Heating, air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep.
gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop manual).
The high-pressure sender -G65- generates a square-wave signal
or data telegram when voltage is applied. This signal changes
with the pressure in the system.
The downstream control units (radiator fan control unit, engine
control unit, operating and display unit for Climatronic air condi‐
tioning system -E87- , Climatronic control unit -J255- etc.) use this
signal to calculate the pressure in the refrigerant circuit and to
actuate the radiator fans and the air conditioning system magnetic
clutch -N25- accordingly or to modify actuation of the air condi‐
tioner compressor regulating valve -N280- ⇒ Heating, air condi‐
tioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-
specific workshop manual).
