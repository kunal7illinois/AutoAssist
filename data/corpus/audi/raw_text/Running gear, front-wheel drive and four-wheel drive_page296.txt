– Peen adjuster screw 6 x -arrows- using a centre punch.
The punch marks must be offset by two graduations in relation to
the drilled out punch marks.
– Mark the position of one of the graduations on the adjuster
screw relative to the steering box housing -1-.
– Unscrew adjuster screw 5.5 graduations anti-clockwise -2-.
This should require a release torque of at least 15 Nm.
If this release torque is not attained:
– Tighten adjuster screw once again to 40 Nm.
– Enlarge the 6 peening points using a centre punch.
– Check that marking of graduation on adjuster screw relative to
steering box housing is still visible. Make new marking if nec‐
essary.
– Unscrew adjuster screw 5.5 graduations anti-clockwise.
This should require a release torque of at least 15 Nm.
– Using -T10304- , turn steering from full left lock to full right lock.
The steering should turn smoothly without sticking. If this is not
the case, the surface of the steering rack is damaged and the
steering box must be renewed.
– Fit rubber boot (left-side) with new hose clip on steering box
housing.
