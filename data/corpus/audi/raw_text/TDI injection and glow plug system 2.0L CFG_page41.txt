starting work and while working on the fuel system.
Each injector normally has a relatively low return flow rate. If the
return flow rate at one injector is relatively high compared to the
other injectors, that injector is probably defective.

solution or similar) before removing.
– Dry all components after cleaning.

-1- and -2- down and at the same time pull release pin upwards
-arrow-.
Note
No dirt must be allowed to get into the disconnected return lines
or the open connections on the injectors.
