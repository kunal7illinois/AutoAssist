Joining techniques and production processes
Overview
In addition to well-known processes such as MIG welding or punch riveting, the joining techniques of Flow
Drill screwing and Kerb-taper riveting are used for the first time on the Audi TT.
In the production process, a laser cleaning method is used for cleaning before the roof drip moulding is
attached by welding.
