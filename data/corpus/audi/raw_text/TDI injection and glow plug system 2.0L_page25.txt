ment

Installing
To ensure the proper function of the air mass meter -G70- it is
important to observe the following notes and instructions.
Note
♦ If the air filter element is very dirty or wet, dirt or water could
reach the air mass meter -G70- and affect the air mass value.
This would lead to loss of power, since a smaller injection
quantity is calculated.
♦ Always use genuine part for air filter element.
♦ Hose connections and hoses for charge air system must be
free of oil and grease before assembly. Do not use any lubri‐
cants containing silicone when assembling.
♦ Both sections of the air cleaner housing MUST be clean.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct type of hose clips
(same as original equipment) ⇒ Parts catalogue

air intake tract (air mass meter, intake pipes, etc.) with a clean
cloth when blowing out the air cleaner housing with com‐
pressed air.
