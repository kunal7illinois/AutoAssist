Note
The setting dimensions are calculated to allow for the motion of
the vehicle when driving. When the vehicle is stationary the di‐
rection of the jets will be slightly different.
– Use water-soluble pen to mark six points on windscreen:
Dimension in mm Driver's side Passenger's side
-a- = 300 300
-b- = 600 600
-c- = 320 320
-d- = 335 335
-e- = 495 495
-f- = 175 175
Note
Bond a bright adhesive strip of tape on the marked positions on
the inside of the windscreen to avoid marking the dimensions
again each time the washer jets are used.
