12.2.3 Removing dents
There is a greater danger of stretching with aluminum than with
steel.
Sharp-edged and hard dent removal tools (e.g. steel hammer)
should be avoided and should be replaced with plastic, wood or
aluminum hammers.
Direct dent removal procedures, that is, aluminum panel lies di‐
rectly between counterhold and dent removal hammer, should be
reduced.
In contrast to steel, dent removal work on aluminum panels be‐
gins in the middle of the dent.
Aluminum panels should be pressed more than struck.
When finishing, handle counterhold loosely. Finishing that is too
forceful can cause the material to stretch. For this reason, you
should use a counterhold made of hardwood.
If the material still stretches, this can be corrected by supplying
heat and retracting.
WARNING
Retracting heat 302º F (150° C) max.
Replace part if a tear forms when removing dents.
12.2.4 Controlling temperature when heating
No tempering colors can be recognized when heating aluminum.
Therefore, temperature must be determined with thermo-pegs or
thermo-strips.
