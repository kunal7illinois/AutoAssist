2.1 Component protection
Most of the control units are equipped with component protection.
In the event of replacement, the new control unit must be adapted
to the vehicle via an on-line link. Failure to do so will result in
activation of the component protection for the newly installed con‐
trol unit.
If component protection is active, the new control unit in the ve‐
hicle will only operate to a limited extent (e.g. no rev. counter
function). Component protection is active:
♦ when you install a new control unit.
♦ when you install a control unit from a different vehicle.
If the component protection function in the drive authorisation
system is activated, it will be active for all other control units with
component protection as well.
The immobilizer function is not a component protection function.
For deactivatio n of component protection, refer to ⇒ Vehicle di‐
agnostic, testing and information system VAS 5051.
