Manual mode
The rear spoiler can be extended up to a speed of 120kph by flicking the adjustable rear spoiler switch E127.
The rear spoiler can also be retracted and extended within a road range between 20kph and 120kph by
flicking the adjustable rear spoiler switch E127. The rear spoiler cannot be retracted at speeds of 120kph or
higher.
W hen driving at speeds of between 0kph and 20kph, the switch must be kept pressed while the rear spoiler is
retracting. If the switch is released while the rear spoiler is retracting, the rear spoiler will stop in its
momentary position. Actuating the switch again will cause the rear spoiler to extend again.
The adjustable rear spoiler warning lamp K242 integrated in switch E127 comes on whenever the rear spoiler
is extended manually. As soon as the rear spoiler is retracted again or the system switches to Automatic mode
because the vehicle is travelling faster than 120kph, the warning lamp goes out again.
Note
When the Transport mode is
activated, the Automatic mode is
active and the "Manual mode" is
deactivated.It is not possible to
extend and retract the rear spoiler by
actuating the adjustable rear spoiler
switch when Transport mode is set.
