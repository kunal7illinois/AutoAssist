Direct panel beating procedures, i.e. aluminium panel is posi‐
tioned directly between counter-hold tool and panel beating ham‐
mer, should be kept to a minimum.
Unlike the procedure for steel panels, you should begin in the
middle of the dent when removing dents on aluminium panels.
Aluminium panels should be pressed rather than beaten.
When finishing, the counterhold tool should be held loosely. If you
apply excessive force when finishing you could stretch the mate‐
rial. For this reason you should use a counterhold tool made of
hardwood.
If material stretching should occur, it can be eliminated by heating
and shrinking.
WARNING
Heat shrinkage temperature max. 150° C.
Note
If a crack or rupture appears during panel beating, the part must
be renewed!
