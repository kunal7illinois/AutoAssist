9.6 Removing and installing fuel pressure
regulating valve -N276-
The fuel pressure regulating valve -N276- -2- is located in the fuel
rail. It maintains a constant pressure in the fuel rail and the injector
pipes (high-pressure fuel circuit).
If the pressure in the high-pressure fuel circuit is too high, the
regulating valve opens to allow some of the fuel to flow back from
the fuel rail to the fuel tank via a return line.
If the pressure in the high-pressure fuel circuit is too low, the fuel
pressure regulating valve -N276- closes and seals off the high-
pressure section of the system from the low-pressure section.
Note
Fuel pressure regulating valve -N276- must always be renewed
after it has been removed.
