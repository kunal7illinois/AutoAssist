Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ If no air conditioner service station with flushing attachment is
available ⇒ Workshop equipment and special tools catalogue
and depending on the version of the air conditioner service
station being used, the refrigerant circuit can also be flushed
with this employing the refrigerant circuit flushing attachment
⇒ Workshop equipment and special tools catalogue , however
flushing must then be performed manually. ⇒ page 65
♦ Use can be made for vehicles with screw connections at the
refrigerant circuit of the adapter -V.A.G 1785/7- and adapter -
V.A.G 1785/8- from the VW/Audi passenger vehicle adapter
set -VAS 6338/1- . Two adapters -V.A.G 1785/8- are required
for a vehicle with screw connections at the air conditioner
compressor and reservoir.
♦ The adapter set for refrigerant circuits -VAS 6338/1- also con‐
tains a short filler hose -VAS 6338/31- with 5/8 -18 UNF
connections and a large inside diameter (commercially avail‐
able).
Preparation
– Discharge the refrigerant circuit ⇒ page 48 .
– Remove the air conditioner compressor ⇒ Heating, air condi‐
tioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-
specific workshop manual).
Vehicle with restrictor and reservoir
– Remove restrictor (vehicle-specific) and re-connect pipes ⇒

Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific Workshop Manual).
– Remove the reservoir (vehicle-specific) and re-connect the
pipes (for this purpose, make use of an adapter and the charg‐
ing hose -VAS 6338/31- from the VW/Audi passenger vehicle
adapter set -VAS 6338/1- ) ⇒ page 71 , ⇒ Heating, air con‐
ditioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87

Note
It would be possible to flush the reservoir, however on account of
its large internal volume it holds too much liquid refrigerant. On
extracting this refrigerant, the reservoir would ice up severely, the
refrigerant would only evaporate very slowly and the extraction
process would be excessively long.
Vehicle with expansion valve and receiver
– Remove the receiver (vehicle-specific, not necessary with all
vehicles) and re-connect the pipes (for this purpose, make use
of an adapter and the charging hose -VAS 6338/31- from the
VW/Audi passenger vehicle adapter set -VAS 6338/1- )
