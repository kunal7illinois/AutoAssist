Joining techniques and production processes
New joining technique: solid punch riveting (Kerb-Konus riveting)
Solid punch riveting or Kerb-Konus riveting involves the use of aluminium or coated stainless steel rivets. In
contrast to punch riveting, the rivet is punched through both sheets to be joined.
Unlike steel rivets, aluminium solid punch rivets can be reworked mechanically. This is the case with the joint
between the body side section and the drip moulding. However, the strength of solid punch riveted joints is
inferior to that of punch riveted joints.

Information on the repair concept
Aluminium solid punch rivets are used in the C-post drip moulding area, while coated stainless steel solid
pu nch rivets are used in the region of the roof frame. Stainless steel rivets must not be drilled out or ground,
due to the risk of corrosion.
