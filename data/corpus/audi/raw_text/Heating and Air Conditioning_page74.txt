Heating and Air Conditioning - Edition 04.2009
Note
♦ Drainage of water out of the plenum chamber may be impaired
by deposits such as leaves and pine needles accumulating in
the water drains -A-. The water level in the plenum chamber
then rises if the vehicle is taken to an automatic car wash or
in the event of heavy rain, water ingresses by way of the intake
housing into the air conditioner unit and is blown by the fresh
air blower -V2- onto the evaporator together with the air con‐
veyed.
♦ If the two grommets -B- of the water drains -A- (on the right
and left of the plenum chamber) are contaminated with leaves
and pine needles, the drains may freeze up in winter and stop
water draining off. After a short journey, the heat emitted by
engine and exhaust system melts the ice in the drains again.
By the time the vehicle arrives at the workshop, the water may
have already drained out of the plenum chamber.
♦ The grommets -B- of the water drains are clipped from above
into the openings of the holders in the area of the suspension
strut dome.
Cleaning

– Remove deposits (leaves, pine needles) and other contami‐
nation from the water drains -A- on the left and right and the
plenum chamber.
Removing
