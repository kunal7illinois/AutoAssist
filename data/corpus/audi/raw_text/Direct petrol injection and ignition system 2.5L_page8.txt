Audi TT 2007 ➤
Direct petrol injection and ignition system (5-cyl. 2.5 ltr. 4-valve turbo) - Edition 03.2009
1.4 Important: Required procedure prior to
opening high-pressure injection system
WARNING
The fuel system operates at extremely high pressure. This can
cause injury.
♦ The injection system consists of a high-pressure section
(maximum approx. 125 bar) and a low-pressure section
(approx. 7 bar).
♦ Prior to opening the high-pressure section (e.g. when re‐
moving the high-pressure pump, fuel rail, injectors, fuel
pipes or fuel pressure sender -G247- ), the fuel pressure
in the high-pressure section must be reduced to a residual
pressure of approx. 7 bar. The procedure is described be‐
low.
Reducing fuel pressure in high-pressure section
– Connect up the vehicle diagnostic, testing and information
system -VAS 5051B- .
– Start engine and run at idling speed.
– Select “Engine electronics” in vehicle self-diagnosis.
– Then select function read “Measured values”.
– Select measured value block 140.
– With engine idling the fuel pressure is displayed in zone 3.
– With engine idling, pull out fuse for fuel pump control unit -
J538- ⇒ Current flow diagrams, Electrical fault finding and
Fitting locations.
Note
Removing the fuse will interrupt the voltage supply “terminal 30”
for the fuel pump control unit -J538- .
– Observe fuel pressure displayed on diagnostic system.
• The fuel pressure will decrease very quickly because the me‐
chanical high-pressure pump is no longer being supplied with
fuel from the fuel tank by the fuel pump -G23- .
– Switch off ignition as soon as fuel pressure has dropped to
approx. 8 bar.
Note
Fuel pressure must not fall below 6 bar, otherwise the engine will
stall (this could damage the catalytic converter).
