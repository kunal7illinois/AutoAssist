Aligning tailpipe:
– Align tailpipes so that distance -a- (left-side) is the same as
distance -a- (right-side).
– At the same time, distance -b- must be obtained between
bumper cut-out and top of tailpipes.
♦ Dimension b = at least 21 mm
– If necessary, unfasten rear silencer mounting to align tailpipes.
1.4 Checking exhaust system for leaks
– Start the engine and run at idling speed.
– Plug the tailpipe (e. g. with rags or stopper) and leave plugged
until the check is complete.
– Listen for noise at connection points (cylinder head/exhaust
manifold, exhaust manifold/front exhaust pipe, etc.) to locate
any leaks.
– Rectify any leaks that are found.
