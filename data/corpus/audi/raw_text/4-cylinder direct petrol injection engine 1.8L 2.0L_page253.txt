Note
♦ The flexible joint (de-coupling element) in the front exhaust
pipe must not be bent more than 10° – otherwise it can be
damaged.
♦ Renew gaskets and self-locking nuts.
♦ After working on the exhaust system, ensure that the system
is not under stress and that it has sufficient clearance from the
body. If necessary, loosen clamp and align silencers and ex‐
haust pipe so that sufficient clearance is maintained to the
body at all points and the mountings are evenly loaded.
♦ The exhaust manifold and the turbocharger are one compo‐
nent; removing and installing ⇒ page 222 .
