6.1 General notes:
Wheel bearings must not be subjected to load after loosening bolt
securing drive shaft at wheel hub.
If the wheel bearings are subjected to the full weight of the vehicle
they will be overloaded, resulting in reduced service life.
Do not attempt to move the vehicle without the drive shafts fitted;
this would result in wheel bearing damage. If the vehicle does
have to be moved, always note the following points:
– Fit an outer joint in place of the drive shaft.
– Tighten the outer joint to 120 Nm (twelve-point bolt) or 200 Nm
(hexagon bolt).
Procedure for loosening bolt securing drive shaft at wheel hub:
♦ ⇒ „6.2 Loosening and tightening hexagon bolt securing drive
shaft to wheel hub“, page 56
♦ ⇒ „6.3 Loosening and tightening twelve-point bolt securing
drive shaft to wheel hub“, page 56
Procedure for tightening bolts securing drive shaft to flange shaft:
♦ First pre-tighten all 6 bolts in diagonal sequence to 10 Nm,
then tighten in diagonal sequence to final specified torque.
