⇒ page 99 .
♦ If requirements are met, continue with procedure after adjust‐
ing valve timing correctly as described below ⇒ page 99 .
Re-adjusting valve timing:
– If camshaft hub cannot be locked, withdraw crankshaft stop -
T10050- until pin is clear of bore.
– Turn crankshaft in opposite direction of engine rotation slightly
past “TDC”.
– Now turn crankshaft slowly in direction of engine rotation until
it is possible to lock camshaft hub.
– Loosen bolts for camshaft sprocket after locking hub.

– Then turn the crankshaft in direction of engine rotation until the
pin -arrow- on the crankshaft stop engages in the sealing
flange as the crankshaft rotates.
– Tighten camshaft sprocket bolts to 20 Nm.
B - If pin of crankshaft stop -T10050- is on right side of bore:
– Turn crankshaft slightly in opposite direction to engine rota‐
tion.
– Turn crankshaft in direction of engine rotation again until pin
of crankshaft stop engages in sealing flange as crankshaft ro‐
tates.

Procedure after adjusting valve timing correctly:
– Remove diesel injection pump locking pin -3359- and crank‐
shaft stop -T10050- .
