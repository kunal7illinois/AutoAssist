– Precision equipment of this type should be treated with ap‐
propriate care.
• If necessary, contact the manufacturer for familiarisation with
the proper use of the wheel alignment equipment.
• Ensure that the sliding plates and turntables are not touching
the end stop when checking the alignment.
• Perform compensation of wheel rim runout: A certain amount
of axial runout at the wheel rims is permissible, but this may
already exceed the specified toe-in tolerance. In such cases it
is not possible to set the toe-in correctly without first compen‐
sating for the wheel runout.
