Convertible top stowed switch F171
The signal from the convertible top stowed switch
F171 informs the convertible top operation control
unit J256 whether the convertible top is stowed in
the convertible top box or not.
The convertible top stowed switch F171 is a Hall
sensor. The sensor is located on the left main
bearing of the convertible top mechanism. When
the convertible top is stowed in the convertible top
box, a metal arm of the convertible top mechanism
is positioned directly opposite the Hall sensor.
The convertible top operation control unit J256
monitors the power supply of the Hall sensor.
If the control unit measures a voltage of approx. 9
volts, then the convertible top is stowed in the
391_052
convertible top box.
If the voltage drops to approx. 3.5 volts, the
convertible top operation control unit J256
recognises that the convertible top is no longer
stowed in the convertible top box.
