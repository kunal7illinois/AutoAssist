Note
♦ Overfilling with refrigerant oil may occur if, for example, the air
conditioner compressor has been replaced without adjusting
the quantity of refrigerant oil.
♦ If the expansion valve is defective (permanently open), the
evaporator temperature is no longer regulated such that only
refrigerant in gas form exits from the evaporator. Under certain
usage conditions, liquid droplets may then be drawn in by the
air conditioner compressor and cause noise (liquid cannot be
compressed).
♦ If there is too much refrigerant oil in the circuit, drain the air
conditioner compressor and replace the receiver. After clean‐
ing the refrigerant circuit (flush with refrigerant R134a
⇒ page 59 or blow out with compressed air and nitrogen
⇒ page 55 ), add the correct amount of refrigerant oil to the
circuit ⇒ page 164 .
