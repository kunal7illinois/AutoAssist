Audi TT 2007 ➤
Heating and Air Conditioning - Edition 04.2009
– Set the rotary temperature control -A- of the heater operating
unit, Climatronic control unit -J255- to the “cold” stop.
– Read out the measured value block with the display for the
position of the left temperature flap control motor -V158- ⇒
"Guided fault-finding" function of vehicle diagnostic, testing
and information system VAS 5051.
– Measure the temperature of the air emerging from the dash
panel vents on the left and right.
Specifications:
♦ The display shows that the left temperature flap control motor
-V158- is set to the “bottom” stop (“cold” stop).
♦ The temperature of the air emerging from the dash panel vents
on the left and right drops within 5 minutes to a value max.15
°C higher than the ambient temperature previously measured.
Check the following if the readout does not match the specifica‐
tions:
♦ If the required heat output is not attained
– Bleeding of coolant circuit ⇒ Engine, mechanics; Rep. Gr. 19
– Incorporation of heating system heat exchanger into coolant
circuit ⇒ Engine, mechanics; Rep. Gr. 19
– Actuation and operation of the left temperature flap control
motor -V158- ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function of vehicle di‐
agnostic, testing and information system VAS 5051.

– Thermostat (engine coolant may not warm up properly if ther‐
mostat is defective) ⇒ Engine, mechanics; Rep. Gr. 19

♦ If the air emerging from the vents is too warm in the “cold”
setting
– Actuation and operation of the left temperature flap control
motor -V158- ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function of vehicle di‐
agnostic, testing and information system VAS 5051.
