3.2 Installing gearbox on vehicles with 2.0
ltr. FSI turbocharged engine
Installation is carried out in reverse sequence; note the following:
Note
♦ Renew self-locking nuts and bolts when performing assembly
work.
♦ Renew oil seals, gaskets, O-rings and bolts which are tight‐
ened by turning through a specified angle.
♦ Secure all hose connections with the correct hose clips (as
original equipment); refer to ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ All cable ties which are released or cut open during removal
must be fitted in the same position when installing.
♦ Clean input shaft splines and (in the case of a used clutch
plate) the hub splines. Remove corrosion and apply only a very
thin coating of grease for clutch plate splines -G 000 100- to
the splines. Then move clutch plate backwards and forwards
on input shaft until hub moves freely on shaft. It is important
to remove excess grease.
♦ When renewing the gearbox, the gearbox selector lever must
be transferred to the new assembly.
♦ Check that dowel sleeves for centralising engine/gearbox are
in the cylinder block; install if necessary.
♦ If the dowel sleeves are not fitted, this will lead to gear-change
problems, clutch malfunction and in some cases gearbox
noise (gears will make rattling noises).
– Use thread tap to remove any remaining locking fluid from all
threaded holes which will accommodate self-locking bolts.
