Welding in new part
Note
As an alternative to welding, rivet on the new part at the separat‐
ing cuts with 4.8 x 9 mm aluminium pop rivets.
WARNING
The body consists of a combination of steel and aluminium
panels. In areas where the two materials meet, the aluminium
parts must be carefully covered and protected when welding.
This prevents contact corrosion caused by weld spatter and
dust particles on the aluminium sections.
