Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Proceed as follows with a completely empty refrigerant circuit to
avoid allowing more refrigerant than is absolutely necessary for
leak detection to escape into the environment when localising re‐
frigerant circuit leaks:
– Evacuate the refrigerant circuit using the air conditioner serv‐
ice station ⇒ page 49 .
Note
♦ If evacuation already reveals a major leak, this is to be located
and eliminated as described ⇒ page 49 .
♦ Continue as follows if evacuation does not reveal any leakage
or if the leakage is so slight that it is not possible to determine
the leakage location.
For leakage which cannot be determined by way of evacuation,
refer to ⇒ page 90 .
