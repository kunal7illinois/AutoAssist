– Align ball hub with cage as shown -arrows- and pivot hub out
of cage.
– Check joint, ball hub, ball cage and balls for pitting and signs
of seizure.
Note
Excessive backlash in the joint will cause knocking or jolts under
load change. In such cases the joint must be renewed. Polished
areas and visible tracks in the ball races are not a reason for re‐
newing the joint.
Installing
Installation is performed in reverse sequence; note the following:
– Insert hub into cage via the two chamfers. No specific instal‐
lation position is required. Push balls into cage.
– Insert hub with cage and balls at a right angle to the joint body.
Note
♦ When inserting, ensure that the wide spacing -a- on the joint
body is aligned with the narrow spacing -b- on the hub after
swivelling in.
♦ Chamfer on internal diameter of ball hub (splines) must face
large diameter of joint body.
♦ On installation, also use felt-tip pen mark made on removal as
a guide.
