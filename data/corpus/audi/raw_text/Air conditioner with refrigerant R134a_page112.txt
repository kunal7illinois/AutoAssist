restrictor and reservoir (with internally
regulated air conditioner compressor)
Note
♦ Connect air conditioner service station ⇒ page 99 .
♦ Observe test requirements ⇒ page 103 .
– Check the pressures in the refrigerant circuit (with the air con‐
ditioner service station) with the ignition switched off
⇒ page 103 .
The pressures with the ignition switched off correspond to the
specifications.
– Start the engine.
– Set engine speed to 2000 rpm.
– Observe the pressure reading (e.g. pressure gauge) of the air
conditioner service station.
Note
♦ Switching pressures for refrigerant circuit switches are vehi‐
cle-specific.
♦ The connection with valve for the low-pressure switch or at the
evaporator is only to be used for vehicles with no service con‐
nection on the low-pressure end and an inaccessible connec‐
tion at the air conditioner compressor or reservoir (measure‐
ment accuracy). Only applies to certain vehicles ⇒ Heating,
air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr.
87 (vehicle-specific workshop manual).
