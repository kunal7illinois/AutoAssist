Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ Condensers with air conditioning system pressure switch -
F129- or high-pressure sender -G65- are supplied for factory
use as part no. XXX XXX 401 X. This condenser is supplied
without an air conditioning system pressure switch -F129- or
high-pressure sender -G65- for replacement purposes as part
no. XXX XXX 403 X.
♦ From 10.98 to 12.98 vehicles with 6-cyl. diesel engine (initially
about 10000) were fitted with condensers of a different design.
The capacity is different for vehicles with these condensers.
The condensers can be identified on the basis of certain char‐
acteristics and the part number ⇒ page 159 .
♦ The Audi A6 is fitted with different air conditioner compressors
depending on the engine and production period.
♦ On condenser replacement, pay attention to the index of the
part number (different flat tube versions, flat tube dimensions
16 mm x 1.7 mm, 18 mm x 1.7 mm or 20 mm x 3 mm) and the
different capacities involved. If a condenser with a different
part number index is installed, the capacity specified on the
label must be checked and amended if necessary or a label
indicating the modified capacity must be affixed over the ex‐
isting label. The part number can be found on a sticker attach‐
ed to the bottom of the condenser.
♦ As of 04.99, production was gradually switched from condens‐
ers with flat tube dimensions 20 mm x 3 mm to condensers
with flat tube dimensions 18 mm x 1.7 mm or 16 mm x 1.7 mm.
The change in production took place gradually during the
course of 1999 depending on the engine and existing supplies
of the different versions. Refer to the Electronic parts cata‐
logue for precise assignment of the different condensers ⇒
Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ Vehicles with 6-cyl. diesel engine produced from 04.99 on‐
wards may be equipped with a condenser with index „D“, „G“,
„R“ or „K“. Observe the different capacities ⇒ Air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific Workshop Manual) and ⇒ Elec‐
tronic parts catalogue .
