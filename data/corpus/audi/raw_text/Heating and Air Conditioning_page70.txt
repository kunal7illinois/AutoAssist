Electronic parts cata‐
logue
❑ The request for activa‐
tion of the radiator fan(s)
-V7- is transmitted by
the air conditioner oper‐
ating unit, Climatronic
control unit -J255- by
way of the data bus to
the engine control unit.
The engine control unit
then actuates the fan(s)
( radiator fan -V7- and
radiator fan 2 -V177- )
directly or by way of the
radiator fan control unit -

❑ The corresponding en‐
gine control unit
switches e.g. the radiator fan -V7- and the radiator fan 2 -V177- (directly via the radiator fan control unit
-J293- ) infinitely to the desired output (depending on the engine type). ⇒ "Guided fault-finding" function
