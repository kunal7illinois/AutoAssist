3.8 Checking colour indicator (electrolyte
level in battery) - batteries with „magic
eye“
Procedure
Note
As the „magic eye“ is only located in one battery cell, the electro‐
lyte level is only checked for this battery cell.
– Prior to visual inspection, use a screwdriver handle to tap gen‐
tly and carefully on the magic eye -arrow-.
Note
When charging the battery and while driving, air bubbles may
form under the „magic eye“ and falsify the colour indicator. Tap‐
ping on the „magic eye“ will disperse the air bubbles underneath.
– Read off electrolyte level in battery from colour indicator. Two
different displays are possible:
Colour indicator Battery charge state
Black or green • Electrolyte level in battery OK
Colourless or light • Electrolyte level in battery too low. Risk of
yellow explosion; do not check or charge bat‐
tery.
WARNING
Risk of explosion due to a discharged battery with „magic eye“.
♦ The battery must NOT be checked or charged if the indi‐
cator of the „magic eye“ is colourless or yellow. Do NOT
boost start the vehicle. There is a risk of explosion when
checking or charging the battery or boost starting the ve‐
hicle. The battery must be renewed.
Note
Observe disposal regulations if battery has to be renewed
