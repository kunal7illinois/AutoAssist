Checking piston
– Using a micrometer (75 ... 100 mm), measure approx. 15 mm
from the lower edge, perpendicular to the piston pin axis.
• Maximum deviation from nominal dimension: 0.04 mm.
Nominal dimension
⇒ “4.3 Piston and cylinder dimensions”, page 87 .
Note
Renew piston if cracking is visible on piston skirt.
Installation position of pistons and allocation of piston/cylinder
• Arrow on piston crown points to pulley end -arrows-.
Measuring cylinder bore
– Use a cylinder gauge -VAS 6078- to take measurements at 3
points in transverse direction -A- and in longitudinal direction
-B-.
• Maximum deviation from nominal dimension: 0.10 mm.
Nominal dimension
⇒ “4.3 Piston and cylinder dimensions”, page 87 .
