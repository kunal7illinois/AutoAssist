Removing dual-mass flywheel
Note
Do not use an impact wrench or pneumatic wrench to remove
bolts -B-: this would severely damage the dual-mass flywheel.
Bolts -B- must always be removed by hand.
– Rotate flywheel -A- so that bolts -B- are aligned centrally be‐
hind the holes -arrows-.
– When unscrewing bolts -B-, make sure the bolt heads do not
contact the flywheel -arrows- because this would damage the
flywheel when the bolts are turned further.
