Wheels and tyres - Edition 02.2010
– -I- SST tyre with air
– -II- SST tyre without air
– Particularly thick sidewalls -A- support the airless tyre on a
standard rim and the vehicle remains manoeuvrable. A special
rubber compound strengthens the tyre and bears the weight
of the vehicle in the event of a puncture.
The sidewalls on the SST tyre are reinforced to prevent pinching
of the tyre between the road and the wheel rim in the event of a
puncture.
Differences between H2 and EH2 extended hump rim designs
♦ EH2 - the extended hump prevents unseating of the SST tyre
after a loss of pressure.
♦ The hump on an EH2 extended hump rim is steeper and near‐
er the centre of the wheel.
WARNING
The clearance from the brake is reduced.
13.2 Servicing tyres with run-flat capability
General information
WARNING
♦ Run-flat tyres must be renewed after a puncture.
♦ Note the special installation instructions.
– As with standard tyre/wheel systems, the wheel must also be
checked before fitting.
– After a puncture, the wheel should be checked for damage
(excessive lateral and radial runout or other damage), as the
wheel may have been damaged if it hit a pothole while the tyre
was flat.
– Damaged wheels must be renewed.
Note
♦ Flat tyre sprays/foams can be used with SST tyres.
♦ Tyres must be renewed after a puncture.
♦ Note the manufacturer's instructions.
13.3 Renewing tyres/conditions for use of
run-flat tyres
Since a loss of pressure on run-flat tyres cannot always be de‐
tected by the naked eye, these tyres must only be used on
vehicles with a tyre pressure monitoring system. The system
warns the driver if the tyre pressure drops below a specified level.
Permissible:
♦ Direct measuring systems
♦ Indirect measuring systems
