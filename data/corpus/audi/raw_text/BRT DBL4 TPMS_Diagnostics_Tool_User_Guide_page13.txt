There are 2 methods that can be used with the BRT-
DBL4, Long Listen and Delta P
To check the sensors Long Listen (Preferred Method):
1. Setup tool for the vehicle you are working on (i.e.
2002 Audi A8 )
2. Place tool against wheel and tire just below the
sensor stem.
3. Press test. You will note the instruction on the
screen prompting you to reduce the pressure of
the wheel and tire, but just hold the tool and wait
for the sensor to transmit.
If this method fails to read the sensor, then move to
Delta P
