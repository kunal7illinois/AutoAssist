11 Temporary spare wheels
11.1 Notes on the use of temporary spare
wheels
Notify your customers of the following information whenever nec‐
essary, and refer them to the Owner's Manual.
The information given below also applies to spare wheels which
have a yellow sticker specifying “MAX 80 km/h” or “MAX 50 mph”.
Note
♦ The spare wheel/temporary spare wheel is designed to be
used only for a brief period. It should therefore be replaced
with the normal wheel as soon as possible.
♦ The tyre pressure should be checked as soon as possible after
fitting the spare wheel/temporary spare wheel. Refer to the
tyre pressure specifications on the vehicle or to the Mainte‐
nance manual for the correct tyre pressures.
♦ Do not exceed the maximum speed stated on the spare wheel
(“MAX 80 km/h” or “MAX 50 mph”).
♦ Avoid full acceleration, heavy braking and fast cornering.
♦ Never drive the vehicle with more than one spare wheel/tem‐
porary spare wheel.
♦ It is not permitted to use snow chains on the spare wheel for
technical reasons.
♦ If you need to use snow chains, you should therefore fit the
spare wheel on the rear axle if the puncture occurred on a front
tyre. The good wheel removed from the rear axle should then
be fitted in place of the punctured front wheel.
