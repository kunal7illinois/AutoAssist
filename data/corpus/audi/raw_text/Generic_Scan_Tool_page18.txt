3.3.3 Diagnostic Mode 03 - Read DTC Mem‐
ory
Diagnostic Mode 03 makes it possible to read emissions-related
faults (confirmed DTCs: faults which have activated the MIL) in
the ECM and in the TCM.
When the ECM recognizes an emission related fault it turns on
the malfunction indicator lamp. If an electronic throttle malfunction
is recognized, the ECM turns on the electronic power control
warning lamp. Both are located in the instrument cluster.
The DTCs are sorted by SAE code with the DTC tables consisting
of a 5 digit alpha numeric value.
