Special aluminium alloys are used for the body.
At the factory the aluminium body is hardened by heat treatment
after it has been assembled. A temperature of 205° C is required
over a period of 30 minutes.
As the body cannot be hardened using workshop equipment, re‐
placement parts are supplied already hardened.
For this reason, it is important that only genuine parts are used
when performing repairs and that the specified working methods
are adhered to.
