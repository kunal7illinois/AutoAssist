Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
2.2.5 Restrictor
The restrictor creates a constriction. This constriction restricts the
flow, thus separating the refrigerant circuit into a high and low-
pressure end. Upstream of the restrictor, the refrigerant is warm
due to the high pressure. Downstream of the restrictor, the refrig‐
erant is cold due to the low pressure. A strainer is provided
upstream of the constriction to trap dirt. The strainer downstream
of the constriction is designed to atomise the refrigerant before it
enters the evaporator.
Note
♦ Arrow -A- on restrictor faces evaporator.
♦ Always replace after opening the circuit.
♦ Different versions exist; heed the applicable notes in the var‐
ious service information booklets ⇒ Heating, air conditioning;
Rep. gr. 87 or ⇒ Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific
workshop manual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
