Air conditioner with refrigerant R134a - Edition 06.2010
Note
♦ The replacement compressor contains the full quantity of oil
intended for the refrigerant circuit. On replacement, the quan‐
tity of oil in the air conditioner compressor is therefore to be
adjusted.
♦ The Audi A6 is fitted with different air conditioner compressors
depending on the engine and production period.
♦ As there are different versions of this type of replacement air
conditioner compressor, the exact part no. must be heeded ⇒
Air conditioning; Rep. gr. 87 (vehicle-specific workshop man‐
ual) and ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
♦ The air conditioner compressor may have been fitted at the
factory with a rating plate indicating the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil in the air conditioner compressor.
♦ On account of the different test bench procedure for this en‐
gine, the 10-cyl. TFSI engine (Audi RS 6) is fitted at the factory
with an air conditioner compressor with a smaller quantity of
refrigerant oil (70+ / - 10 cm3 ) than for the 10-cyl. FSI engine
(Audi S6) and the other engines (130 + / - 10 cm3 ) (at present,
the air conditioner compressors on the 10-cyl. FSI and the 10-
cyl. TFSI only differ in terms of the part number and the
quantity of refrigerant oil; refer also to the air conditioner com‐
pressor rating plate). To adjust the total quantity of oil in the
refrigerant circuit at the factory, the missing amount of oil in
the air conditioner compressor (60+ / - 10 cm3 ) with the 10-
cyl. TFSI engine (Audi RS 6) is added at a different point in the
refrigerant circui t . This is not necessary when performing serv‐
ice work, as replacement air conditioner compressors are only
supplied with the original quantity of oil (130+ / - 10 cm3 )
(would only be required as part of service work if a new air
conditioner compressor with the smaller quantity of oil were to
be installed) ⇒ Electronic parts catalogue .
