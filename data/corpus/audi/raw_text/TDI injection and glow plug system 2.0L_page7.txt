1.3 Safety precautions for vehicles with
start/stop system
WARNING
Risk of injury due to automatic engine start on vehicles with
start/stop system.
♦ On vehicles with activated start/stop system (this is indi‐
cated by a message in the instrument cluster display), the
engine may start automatically on demand.
♦ Therefore it is important to ensure that the start/stop sys‐
tem is deactivated when performing repairs (switch off
ignition, if required switch on ignition again).
1.4 To avoid any risk of injuries to persons
and/or damage to the injection and glow
plug system, always observe the follow‐
ing safety precautions:
♦ Persons wearing a pacemaker should not lean over the engine
compartment while the engine is running, as the injectors use
high voltage pulses.
♦ Do not open any fuel line connections while the engine is run‐
ning.
♦ Always switch off the ignition before connecting or discon‐
necting injection and glow plug system wiring or tester cables.
♦ Always switch off the ignition before cleaning the engine.
♦ Always switch off the ignition before connecting or discon‐
necting the battery, otherwise the engine control unit may be
damaged.
♦ Certain tests may lead to a fault being detected by the control
unit and stored. The fault memory should therefore be inter‐
rogated and (if necessary) erased after completing the tests
and any repair work that may be required.
