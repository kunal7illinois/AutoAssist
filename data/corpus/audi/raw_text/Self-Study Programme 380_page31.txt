Rear axle
The rear axle of the Audi TT Coupé ‘07 is basically identical in design and function to the rear axle on the
AudiA3. The wheel carriers, damper bearings and wheel bearings are modifications on the components on
the Audi A3.Track width has been increased by 15 mm on each side compared to the AudiA3. The suspension
and damping components (springs, dampers and anti-roll bars) were adapted to the specific requirements of
the TTCoupé. Additional stone chip protection is provided for certain markets. The trailing arms and spring
links on these models are protected by plastic claddings.
