11.1 General notes:
Wheel bearings must not be subjected to load after loosening bolt
securing drive shaft at wheel hub.
If the wheel bearings are subjected to the full weight of the vehicle
they will be overloaded, resulting in reduced service life.
Do not attempt to move the vehicle without the drive shafts fitted;
this would result in wheel bearing damage. If the vehicle does
have to be moved, always note the following points:
– Fit an outer joint in place of the drive shaft.
– Tighten the outer joint to 120 Nm (twelve-point bolt) or 200 Nm
(hexagon bolt).
Procedure for loosening bolt securing drive shaft at wheel hub:
♦ ⇒ „11.2 Loosening and tightening hexagon bolt securing drive
shaft to wheel hub“, page 210
♦ ⇒ „11.3 Loosening and tightening twelve-point bolt securing
drive shaft to wheel hub“, page 211
Procedure for tightening bolts securing drive shaft to flange shaft:
♦ First pre-tighten all 6 bolts in diagonal sequence to 10 Nm,
then tighten in diagonal sequence to final specified torque.
Before fitting the outer joint in the wheel hub, apply a thin coat of
assembly paste to the splines on the outer joint ⇒ Electronic parts
catalogue .
When working on the vehicle, do not allow the drive shafts to hang
down under their own weight and never let the joints bend to such
an extent that they contact the end stop.
Always renew self-locking bolts/nuts.
Always renew bolts and nuts which are tightened by turning
through a specified a ngle.
