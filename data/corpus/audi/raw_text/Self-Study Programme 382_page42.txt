Audi Navigation (BNS 5.0)
382_048
When model year 2007 is launched, the BNS 5.0 navigation system in the Audi A3, A4, TT will replace the
current BNS 4.1 navigation system.
The system combines the concept of the Navigation System Plus (RNS-E) with the display of the MMI basic
system. Unlike the Navigation plus system, the BNS 5.0 navigation system features CD navigation and
a monochrome screen but no SD/MMC card reader.
For the first time, it is possible to navigate even with the navigation CD removed, which means that the drive
can also be used to play audio CDs.
