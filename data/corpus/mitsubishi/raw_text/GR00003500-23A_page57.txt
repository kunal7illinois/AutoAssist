STEP 12. Check connector B-07 at throttle position sensor
for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?

(2) Measure the resistance between connector terminal 1 and
4.
Standard value: 3.5 − 6.5 kΩ
HARNESS
CONNECTOR: B-07
ACX02093AC
(3) Measure resistance between the throttle position sensor
side connector terminal 1 and 3.
(4) Move the throttle valve from the idle position to full-open
HARNESS position.
CONNECTOR: B-07 • Resistance should change smoothly in proportion to
opening angle of the throttle valve.
Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 14.
NO : Replace the throttle position sensor. Refer to GROUP
ACX02094AC 13A <2.4L Engine>, Throttle Body Assembly P.13A-
592 or 13B <3.0L Engine>, Throttle Body Assembly
