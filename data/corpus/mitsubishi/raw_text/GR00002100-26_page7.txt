CAUTION
• For vehicles with ABS, be careful when handling the projection at the tip of the speed sensor so
as not to damage it by striking against other parts.
• The front hub assembly should not be disassembled. When removing the front hub assembly, the
wheel bearing inner race may be left at the spindle side. In this case, always replace the front hub
assembly, otherwise the hub will damage the oil seal, causing oil leaks or excessive play.
Post-installation Operation

Damage in Ball Joint Dust Cover.
