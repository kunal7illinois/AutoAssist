13B-628 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 8. Check the power supply voltage at interlock
switch connector C-02.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-02 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "START" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
C-02 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 9.
2 1
NO : Check connector C-07 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connectors is in good condition,
AK000384AB repair harness wire between starter relay connector
A-13X terminal 1 and interlock switch connector C-02
terminal 2 because of open circuit. Then confirm that
the malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 9. Check the continuity at interlock switch harness
side connector C-02.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-02 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 1 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
Q:Is the continuity normal?
C-02 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR YES : Replace the ECM. Then confirm that the malfunction
symptom is eliminated.
2 1
NO : Repair harness wire between interlock switch
connector C-02 terminal 1 and ground because of
open circuit or harness damage. Then confirm that
the malfunction symptom is eliminated.
