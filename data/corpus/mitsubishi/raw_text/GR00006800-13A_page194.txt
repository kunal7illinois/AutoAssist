13A-194 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 14. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to,
Procedure 2 − Fuel Trim Monitor P.13A-5.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0171 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
DTC P0172: System too Rich
. • Volume air flow sensor output frequency is 88 Hz
System too Rich Circuit
• Refer to, DTC P0201 − P0204 Injector Circuit or less.
Malfunction P.13A-216. Judgment Criteria
• Long-term fuel trim has continued to be lower
. CIRCUIT OPERATION than −12.5 percent for 5 seconds.
• Refer to, DTC P0201 − P0204 Injector Circuit or
Malfunction P.13A-216. • Short-term fuel trim has continued to be lower
than −15.0 percent for 5 seconds.
.
TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION Check Conditions
• If a malfunction occurs in the fuel system, the fuel • Engine coolant temperature is higher than 77°C

• The ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> checks whether • Under the closed loop air/fuel ratio control.
the fuel trim value is within a specified range.
Judgment Criteria
• Long-term fuel trim has continued to be −12.5
