Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
NOTE: The standard idle speed has been adjusted with the
speed adjusting screw (SAS), by the manufacturer, and there
should be no need for readjustment.
NOTE: If the adjustment has been changed by mistake, the idle
speed may become too high or the idle speed may drop too low
when loads A/C, defogger, etc. are placed on the engine. If this
occurs, adjust by the following procedure.
NOTE: The adjustment, if made, should be made after first
confirming that the spark plugs, the injectors, the idle air control
motor, compression, etc., are all normal.
1. The vehicle should be prepared as follows before the
inspection and adjustment.
• Engine coolant temperature: 80 − 95° C(176 − 203°F)
• Lights, electric cooling fan and accessories: OFF
• Transaxle: Neutral (A/T for "P" range)

Standard value: 700 ± 50 r/min
NOTE: The engine speed may be 20 to 100 r/min lower than
indicated above for a new vehicle [driven approximately 500
km (300 mile) or less], but no adjustment is necessary.
NOTE: If the engine stalls or the engine speed is low even
though the vehicle has been driven approximately 500 km
(300 mile) or more, it is probable that deposits are adhered
to the throttle valve, so clean it. (Refer to P.13A-575)
