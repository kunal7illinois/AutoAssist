ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
1. Close the high and low-pressure valve of the gauge
manifold.
LOW-PRESSURE HIGH-PRESSURE
2. Connect the charging hose (blue) to the low-pressure valve

and connect the charging hose (red) to the high-pressure
valve of the gauge manifold.
3. Install the quick joint (for low-pressure) to the charging hose
(blue), and connect the quick joint (for high-pressure) to the
charging hose (red).

• A/C switch: A/C − ON position
• Mode selection: FACE position
• Temperature control: MAXIMUM COOLING position
• Air selection: RECIRCULATION position
• Blower switch: "4" (Fast) position
7. Adjust engine speed to 1,500 r/min with A/C clutch engaged.
8. Engine should be warmed up with doors and windows
closed.
9. Insert a thermometer in the center air outlet and operate the
engine for 20 minutes.
NOTE: If the clutch cycles, take the reading before the clutch
