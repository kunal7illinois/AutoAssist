DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 25:
Barometric Pressure Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
25, Barometric Pressure Sensor.
16 PIN • When altitude is 0 m (0 foot), 101 kPa.
• When altitude is 600 m (1,969 feet), 95 kPa.
MB991502
• When altitude is 1,200 m (3,937 feet), 88 kPa.
AKX01177AB
• When altitude is 1,800 m (5,906 feet), 81 kPa.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
