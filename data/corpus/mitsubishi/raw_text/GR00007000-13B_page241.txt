MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-241
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check the left bank heated oxygen sensor (rear).
(1) Disconnect left bank heated oxygen sensor (rear) connector
B-23 and connect test harness special tool, MB991316, to
the connector on the left bank heated oxygen (rear) sensor
side.

(2) Measure the resistance between heated oxygen sensor
HEATED
connector terminal 1 (red clip) and terminal 3 (blue clip).
OXYGEN
SENSOR Standard value: 11 − 18 ohm [at 20°C (68°F)]
RED EQUIPMENT
Q:Is the resistance normal?
SIDE
CONNECTOR YES : Go to Step 3.
BLUE NO : Replace the left bank heated oxygen sensor (rear).
Then go to Step 12.

STEP 3. Check the power supply voltage at left bank
heated oxygen sensor (rear) harness side connector B-23.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-23 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
