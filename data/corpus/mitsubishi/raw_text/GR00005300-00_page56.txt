When removing the radiator cap, use care to avoid contact
with hot coolant or steam. Place a shop towel over the cap
and turn the cap counterclockwise a little to let the pres-
sure escape through the vinyl tube. After relieving the
steam pressure, remove the cap by slowly turning it coun-
terclockwise.
4. Remove the radiator cap, radiator drain plug and if equipped
engine coolant drain plug to drain the coolant.
5. Remove the reserve tank and drain the coolant.
6. After completely draining the coolant, reinstall the drain
plugs and flush the engine and radiator using a radiator
cleaning fluid.

Do not use alcohol or methanol anti-freeze or any engine
coolants mixed with alcohol or methanol anti-freeze. The
use of an improper anti-freeze can cause corrosion of the
aluminum components.

concentration for safe operating temperature within the
range of 30 to 60 %. Use special tool MB991871 to refill the
coolant. A convenient mixture is a 50 % water and 50 %
