4. Disconnect the crankshaft position sensor connector.
<3.0L ENGINE – WITHOUT VIC>
NOTE: Doing this will prevent the engine control module
from carrying out ignition and fuel injection.
CRANKSHAFT POSITION WARNING
SENSOR CONNECTOR
Keep your distance from the spark plug hole when
cranking. Oil, fuel, etc., may spray out from the spark
plug hole and may cause serious injury.
5. Cover the spark plug hole with a shop towel etc., during
cranking. After the engine has been cranked, check for

foreign material adhering to the shop towel.

6. Set compression gauge to one of the spark plug holes.
COMPRESSION 7. Crank the engine with the throttle valve fully open and
GAUGE
measure the compression pressure.
<without VIC>
Standard value (at engine speed of 250 − 400 r/min):
824 kPa (119 psi)
Minimum limit (at engine speed of 250 − 400 r/min):
575 kPa (83 psi)
<with VIC>
AKX01199AB
Standard value (at engine speed of 250 r/min): 1,470
kPa (212 psi)
Minimum limit (at engine speed of 250 r/min): 1,029
kPa (149 psi)
8. Measure the compression pressure for all the cylinders, and
check that the pressure differences of the cylinders are
below the limit.
Limit: 98 kPa (14 psi)
9. If there is a cylinder with compression or a compression
difference that is outside the limit, pour a small amount of
engine oil through the spark plug hole, and repeat the
operations in steps 6 to 8.
(1) If the compression increases after oil is added, the cause
of the malfunction is a worn or damaged piston ring and/
or cylinder inner surface.
(2) If the compression does not rise after oil is added, the
cause is a burnt or defective valve seat, or pressure is
leaking from the gasket.
10.Connect the crankshaft position sensor connector.
11.Install the spark plugs and spark plug cables.
12.Use the scan tool to erase the diagnostic trouble codes.
