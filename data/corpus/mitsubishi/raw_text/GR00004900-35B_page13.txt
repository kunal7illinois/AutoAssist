ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) 35B-13
ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) DIAGNOSIS
Q:Is any of the harness wires between the ABS-ECU
CONNECTOR: A-02
connector A-02 (terminals 1, 3, 8, and 9) and the wheel
speed sensor connectors D-08 <rear: RH> (terminals 1
and 2) or D-09 <rear: LH> (terminals 1 and 2) damaged?
YES : Repair it and then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 7.
HARNESS SIDE

STEP 6. Check the wheel speed sensor output voltage.
Refer to P.35B-46.
Output Voltage:
• When measured with a voltmeter: 42 mV or more
• When measured with oscilloscope (maximum voltage): 200
mV or more
Q:Does the voltage meet the specification?
YES : Replace the hydraulic unit (integrated with ABS-ECU)
and then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 7.
STEP 7. Check the wheel speed sensor or ABS rotor.
Refer to P.35B-55. If there is a damage in any of the following
check items, replace the wheel speed sensor or the ABS rotor.
Check items:
• Wheel speed sensor internal resistance
Standard value: 1.28 − 1.92 kΩ
• Insulation between the wheel speed sensor body and con-
nector terminals
• Toothed ABS rotor
Q:Is the wheel speed sensor or ABS rotor damaged?
YES : Replace the faulty part and then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 8.
