3 to the positive battery terminal and terminal 2 to the
negative battery terminal.
(4) Check the continuity between the each fuel pump relay
terminals 1 and 4 while connecting and disconnecting the
jumper wire at the negative battery terminal.
• Should be less than 2 ohm. (Negative battery terminal
connected)
• Should be open loop. (Negative battery terminal discon-
nected)
(5) Install the fuel pump relay 1 and 2.
Q:Is the resistance normal?
