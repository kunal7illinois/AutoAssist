13B-522 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the continuity at manifold differential
pressure sensor harness side connector B-04.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-04 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Measure the continuity between terminal 2 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.

STEP 7. Check connector C-58 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-55 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-58<M/T>, C-55<A/T>
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T>
