With this system, after the outside air or inside air is
taken in through the damper, it is fed to the evapora-
tor by the blower fan and motor and cooled. The air
cooled by the air mix damper is mixed appropriately
with the warmed air to achieve a comfortable temper-
ature. If the A/C does not operate or the cooled air is
not discharged, the machine components or relay
may be faulty.
