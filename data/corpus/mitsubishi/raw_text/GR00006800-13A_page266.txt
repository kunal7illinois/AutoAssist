13A-266 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 12. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to,
Procedure 6 − Other Monitor P.13A-5.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0403 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
