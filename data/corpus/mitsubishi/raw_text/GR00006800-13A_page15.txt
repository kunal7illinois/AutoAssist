MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
PROCEDURE 1
EVAPORATIVE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM LEAK MONITOR
DTC P0441, P0442, P0451, P0452, P0453, P0455, P0456
Drive cycle This monitor [from start to ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position] will be completed
pattern while traveling with the following drive cycle pattern. It will take 8 minutes. You must
complete this drive twice.
NOTE: . Vehicle speed and throttle opening angle should be within the shaded range.

Inspection • Engine coolant temperature: 45°C (113°F) or less (The engine is stopped before the test
conditions drive is started)
• Atmospheric temperature: 5 − 45°C (41 − 113°F)
• Condition of A/T: Selector lever D range
Test 1.Engine: start
procedure 2.Accelerate until the vehicle speed is 89 − 97 km/h (55 − 60 mph).
3.Travel for 200 seconds or more while keeping the vehicle speed at 89 − 97 km/h (55 − 60
mph). (M/T: 5th speed)
4.While keeping the accelerator pedal opening degree constant, keep the vehicle speed at
89 − 97 km/h (55 − 60 mph) and travel for 150 seconds or more. (During monitor)
5.Return the vehicle to the shop, then turn the ignition switch to "LOCK" (OFF) position.
6.Confirm that the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is not output.
7.If DTC P0441 is output, refer to DTC P0441 − Evaporative Emission Control System
Incorrect Purge Flow P.13A-269.
If DTC P0442 is output, refer to DTC P0442 − Evaporative Emission Control System Leak
Detected (Small Leak) P.13A-271.
If DTC P0451 is output, refer to DTC P0451 − Evaporative Emission Control System
Pressure Sensor Range/performance P.13A-299.
If DTC P0452 is output, refer to DTC P0452 − Evaporative Emission Control System
Pressure Sensor Low Input P.13A-316.
If DTC P0453 is output, refer to DTC P0453 − Evaporative Emission Control System
Pressure Sensor High Input P.13A-332.
If DTC P0455 is output, refer to DTC P0455 − Evaporative Emission Control System Leak
Detected (Gross Leak) P.13A-348.
If DTC P0456 is output, refer to DTC P0456 − Evaporative Emission Control System Leak
Detected (Very Small Leak) P.13A-364.
