54B-508 SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS)
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 6. Check the passenger’s door switch.
Remove the passenger’s door switch. Then check the continu-
CONNECTOR <ECLIPSE>: D-01
ity between the switch terminal and the switch body.

Q:Is the passenger’s door switch in good condition?
AC106483AG
YES : Go to Step 7.
CONNECTOR <ECLIPSE SPYDER>: D-01 NO : Replace the passenger’s door switch. If the functions,
which are described in "CIRCUIT OPERATION", work
normally, the input signal from the passenger’s door
switch should be normal.

STEP 7. Measure at the lower metal part of the passenger’s
door switch in order to check the ground circuit to the
passenger’s door switch.
NOTE: Check that the passenger’s door switch is grounded to
the vehicle body by means of its mounting screw.
Remove the cap, and measure the resistance value between
the lower metal part and the ground.
• The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.
METAL PART
Q:Does the measured resistance value correspond with
this range?
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Check the fit of the switch, and repair if necessary.6If
the functions, which are described in "CIRCUIT
OPERATION", work normally, the input signal from
