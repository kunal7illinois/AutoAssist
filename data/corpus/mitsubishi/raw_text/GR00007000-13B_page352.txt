MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP1. Using scan tool MB991502, check actuator test
item 08: Evaporative Emission Purge Solenoid.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the actuator test mode for item
08, Evaporative emission purge solenoid.
16 PIN • An operation sound should be heard and vibration
should be felt when the evaporative emission purge
MB991502
solenoid is operated.
AKX01177AB
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the solenoid operating properly?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Replace the evaporative emission purge solenoid.
Then go to Step 4.
STEP 2. Using scan tool MB991502, check actuator test
item 29: Evaporative Emission Ventilation Solenoid.
(1) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the actuator test mode for item
29, Evaporative emission ventilation solenoid.
• An operation sound should be heard and vibration
should be felt when the evaporative emission ventilation
solenoid is operated.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
16 PIN
Q:Is the solenoid operating properly?
MB991502 YES : Go to Step 3.
AKX01177AB NO : Replace the evaporative emission ventilation
solenoid. Then go to Step 4.
STEP 3. Check for clogging in the vent hose and air filter
Q:Are there any clogs?
YES : Repair or replace it. Then go to Step 4.
