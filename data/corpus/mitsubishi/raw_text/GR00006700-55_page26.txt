REFILLING OF OIL IN THE A/C SYSTEM
Too little oil will provide inadequate compressor lubrication and
cause a compressor failure. Too much oil will increase dis-
charge air temperature.
When a compressor is installed at the factory, it contains 120
cm3 (4.1 floz) of refrigerant oil. While the A/C system is in oper-
ation, the oil is carried through the entire system by the refriger-
ant. Some of this oil will be trapped and retained in various
parts of the system.
When the following system components are changed, it is nec-
essary to add oil to the system to replace the oil being removed
with the component.
Compressor oil: SUN PAG 56
Quantity:
• Evaporator: 60 cm3 (2.0 floz)
• Condenser: 15 cm3 (0.5 floz)
• Suction hose: 10 cm3 (0.3 floz)
