DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991316: Test Harness
STEP 1. Check connector B-28 at the right bank heated
oxygen sensor (rear) for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: B-28
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
