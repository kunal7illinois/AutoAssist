MASTER CYLINDER BLEEDING
The master cylinder used has no check valve, so if bleeding is
carried out by the following procedure, bleeding of air from the
brake pipeline will become easier. (When brake fluid is not con-
tained in the master cylinder.)
1. Fill the reserve tank with brake fluid.
2. Keep the brake pedal depressed.
3. Have another person cover the master cylinder outlet with a
finger.
4. With the outlet still closed, release the brake pedal.
5. Repeat steps 2 − 4 three or four times to fill the inside of the
master cylinder with brake fluid.
