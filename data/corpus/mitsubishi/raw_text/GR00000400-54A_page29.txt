CHASSIS ELECTRICAL 54A-29
IGNITION SWITCH
CAUTION
Because registering the encrypted codes is done after all
previously-registered codes have been erased, you should
keep all of the ignition keys that have already been regis-
tered accessible.
If the ignition key, Immobilizer-ECU, ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/
T> is replaced or an ignition key is added, encrypted codes of
all the ignition keys must be registered. (A maximum of eight
different ignition key can be registered.) Moreover, when the
immobilizer-ECU has been replaced, you will need to use scan
tool MB991502 to register the immobilizer-ECU and input the
vehicle secret code and to register the password (secret code)
that the owner specifies into the immobilizer-ECU.
If an attempt is made to start the engine with an unregistered
"SECURITY" indicator light
ignition key, cranking occurs, but fuel supply is cut off to disable

POINTS TO NOTE DURING OPERATION
If none of the functions can be used, check the diagnostic trou-
ble codes, and after carrying out any necessary repairs, repeat
the operation.
If an incorrect password is input five times in a row, the immobi-
lizer-ECU judges that an unauthorized operation is being
attempted. Start-prevention mode will be set, and engine oper-
ation will stop and all special functions will be disabled. If the
ignition switch is turned to "ON" position and left in that position
for approximately 20 minutes, "Unauthorized operation, start-
prevention mode" will be cancelled.
KEY ID REGISTER
All ignition keys can be registered with scan tool MB991502.
Additional ignition keys can be registered with or without scan
tool MB991502.
If an ignition key is registered using scan tool MB991502, no
registered ignition keys must be lost.
