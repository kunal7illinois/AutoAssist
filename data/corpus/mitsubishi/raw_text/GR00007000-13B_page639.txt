MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-639
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check connector C-51, C-62 at ECM <M/T> or
connector C-52, C-59 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTORS : C-51, C-62<M/T>,
C-52, C-59<A/T> YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T>
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.

STEP 2. Check the circuit at ECM connector C-51 <M/T> or
PCM connector C-52 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connectors C-51 <M/T> or C-52 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 20 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Using a jumper wire, connect terminal 20 to ground.
