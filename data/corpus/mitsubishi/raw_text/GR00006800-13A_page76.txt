MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check connector B-14 at the intake air
temperature sensor for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-14
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 11.

STEP 4. Check the sensor supply voltage at intake air
temperature sensor harness side connector B-14.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-14 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 6 and ground.
B-14 HARNESS • Voltage should be between 4.5 and 4.9 volts.
