VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR CHECK <M/T>
1. Remove the vehicle speed sensor and connect a 3 − 10
ohms resistor as shown in the illustration.
TURN
2. Turn the shaft of the vehicle speed sensor and check that
SHAFT there is voltage between terminals 2 − 3. (1 turn = 4 pulses)
3. If within the standard value, the vehicle speed sensor is OK.
If not within the standard value, replace the vehicle speed
sensor.

OUTPUT SHAFT SPEED SENSOR CHECK <A/T>
The output shaft speed sensor cannot be checked as an indi-
vidual part after the sensor has been removed. Using scan tool
MB991502, check whether diagnosis code 23 is set while the
sensor is installed. If this code is set, refer to "Combination
meter diagnosis − Symptom Procedure 1" P.54A-40.
FUEL GAUGE RESISTANCE CHECK
CAUTION
When inserting a testing probe into the power supply ter-
minal, be careful not to touch the printed board.
POWER SUPPLY 1. Remove the power supply tightening screw.
2. Use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance value between
the terminals.
Standard value:
GROUND
• Power supply − Ground: Approximately 233 ohms
• Power supply − Fuel gauge: Approximately 108
ohms
FUEL GAUGE
AC001297AB • Fuel gauge − Ground: Approximately 125 ohms
3. If within the standard value, the fuel gauge is OK.
If not within the standard value, replace the fuel gauge and
engine coolant temperature gauge.
