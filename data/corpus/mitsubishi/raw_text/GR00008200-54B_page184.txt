Washer control ETACS-ECU, front ECU, column switch
WINDSHIELD WIPER AND WASHER CONTROL FUNCTION
.
Intermittent control (Vehicle speed-dependent variable
type)
The ETACS-ECU calculates the intermittent time according to
Change in intermittent time by intermittent
time adjusting volume (when vehicle is the vehicle speed calculated from the windshield wiper intermit-
stationary) tent time adjusting knob and vehicle speed signal (ECM <M/T>
18
or PCM <A/T>,) and sends it to the front ECU as SWS data.
NOTE: The vehicle speed-dependent function can be disabled
Intermittent
by the configuration function (Refer to P.54B-627.)

The front ECU determines the intermittent time TI from the
input SWS data signal, and turns ON the windshield wiper drive
