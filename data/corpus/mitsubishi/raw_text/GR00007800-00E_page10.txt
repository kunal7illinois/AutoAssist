NOTE: The deenergized state means that no current is flowing

When a normally closed relay as illustrated here is checked,
there should be continuity between terminals 1 and 2 and
between terminals 3 and 4 when the relay is deenergized.
There should be no continuity between terminals 3 and 4 when
4 2 4 2 battery voltage and ground are applied to terminals 1 and 2.

1. When current flows through the coil of a relay, its core is

magnetized to attract the iron piece, closing (ON) the
SPRING contact at the tip of the iron piece. When the coil current is
COIL
turned off, the iron piece returns to its original position by a
spring, opening the contact (OFF).

2. By using a relay, a heavy current can be turned on and off by
POWER SUPPLY
a switch using much less current. For example, in the circuit
shown here, when the switch is turned on (closed), current
flows to the coil of the relay. Then, its contact is turned on
RELAY
(closed) and the light comes on. The current flowing through
OFF ON
the switch is much less than that for the light.
