MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION • However, time is not counted if any of the follow-
• The engine coolant temperature sensor converts ing conditions are met.
the engine coolant temperature to a voltage and 1. Intake air temperature is 60°C (140°F) or
output it. more.
• The ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> checks whether 2. Volume air flow sensor output frequency is 70

DTC SET CONDITIONS • The ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> monitors for this
condition once during the drive cycle.
Check Conditions
• Engine coolant temperature was 7°C (45°F) or

sor circuit, or loose connector.
Judgement Criteria
• ECM failed. <M/T>
• Engine coolant temperature fluctuates within 1°C
• PCM failed. <A/T>
(1.8°F) after 5 minutes have passed since the
engine was started.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 21:
Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
21, Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
16 PIN • The engine coolant temperature and temperature
shown with the scan tool should approximately match.
MB991502
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
