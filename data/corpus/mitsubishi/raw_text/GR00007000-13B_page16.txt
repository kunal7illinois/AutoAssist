Inspection • Engine coolant temperature: 80 − 97°C (176 - 207°F)
conditions • Atmospheric temperature: -10 − 60°C (14 − 140°F)
• Condition of A/T: Selector lever D range
Test 1.Engine: start
procedure 2.Accelerate until the vehicle speed is 89 − 97 km/h (55 − 60 mph).
3.Travel for 30 minutes or more while keeping the vehicle speed at 89 − 97 km/h (55 - 60
mph). (M/T = 5th speed) Carry out one gradual acceleration /deceleration, returning to a
speed of 50 − 60 mph within 120 seconds. (During monitor)
4.Return the vehicle to the shop, then turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
5.Confirm that the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is not output.
6.If DTC P0171 is output, refer to DTC P0171 − System too lean (Bank1) P.13B-245.
If DTC P0172 is output, refer to DTC P0172 − System too rich (Bank1) P.13B-252.
If DTC P0174 is output, refer to DTC P0174 − System too lean (Bank2) P.13B-256.
