17-30 ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL
AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
STEP 12. Check the harness wire between auto-cruise
control vacuum pump connector A-01 (terminal numbers
2, 3 and 4) and auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20
(terminal numbers 7, 8 and 16).
Q:Is any harness wire between auto-cruise control
CONNECTOR: A-01
vacuum pump connector A-01 (terminal numbers 2,3
RESERVE and 4) and auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20
TANK
(terminal numbers 7,8 and 16) damaged?
YES : Repair harness wire and then check that diagnostic
trouble code 14 is not output.
NO : Check that diagnostic trouble code 14 is not output.
If diagnostic trouble code 14 is output, replace the
auto-cruise control-ECU. (Refer to P.17-86.)
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 14 is not

STEP 13. Check the output circuit voltage at auto-cruise
control-ECU connector C-20 (terminal number 5) by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position and the auto-
cruise control main switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 5 and ground by
backprobing.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage approximately battery positive voltage?
