3. If the computer determines that the driver tends
to apply the brakes often on a descending road-
way, it adjusts timing to down shift sooner so that
engine braking is more effectively applied. Con-
versely, if the computer determines that the driver
does not brake much while driving downhill, it
delays downshifting to minimize the effect of
engine braking.
