GENERAL DESCRIPTION CONCERNING HEADLIGHT AND TAILLIGHT
M1549021300015
The following ECUs affect the functions and control
of the headlights and the taillights.
Functions Control ECU
Taillight Front ECU, column switch
Headlights and high-beam indicator light ETACS-ECU, front ECU, column switch
Headlight automatic-shutdown function ETACS-ECU, front ECU, column switch
Dimmer automatic reset function Front ECU, column switch
Taillights and headlights illumination
.
Taillight
If the column switch sends a taillight switch "ON" signal to the
front-ECU, the front-ECU turns on its taillight relay, causing the
taillights to illuminate.
ON
Taillight
switch NOTE: This description covers the taillights only. In actual driv-
OFF ing, the taillights may be turned off due to the headlight auto-
matic shut-down function. For the details of the headlight
ON automatic shut-down function, refer to its Section.
Taillight
relay
OFF . Headlights and high-beam indicator light
If the column switch sends a headlight switch "ON" signal to the
AC106502AB front-ECU, the front-ECU turns on its headlight relay (LO),
causing the low-beam headlights to illuminate. If the dimmer
switch is turned on while the headlight relay (LO) is on, the
front-ECU turns on the headlight relay (HI), causing the high-
beam headlights to illuminate.
If the acknowledgement signal, which the front-ECU sends to
the SWS communication line, turns to "HI-BEAM ACK", or the
headlight switch signal, which the column switch (column-ECU)
sends to the SWS communication line, turns to "PASSING", the
ETACS-ECU will illuminate the high-beam indicator light.
NOTE: This description covers the headlights only. In actual
driving, the headlights may be turned off due to the headlight
automatic shut-down function. For the details of the headlight
automatic shut-down function, refer to its Section.
