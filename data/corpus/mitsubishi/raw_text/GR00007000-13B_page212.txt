DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB998464: Test Harness Set
STEP 1. Check connector B-24 at the left bank heated
oxygen sensor (front) for damage.
Q:Is the harness connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: B-24
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
