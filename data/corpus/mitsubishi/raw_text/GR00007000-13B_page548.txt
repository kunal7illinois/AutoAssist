13B-548 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 14. Check for harness damage between injector
connector and ECM connector <M/T> or PCM connector
<A/T>.
a. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-
CONNECTORS : B-01, B-02, B-05, B-06,
B-25, B-26 01 terminal 2 and ECM connector C-51 terminal 1 <M/
T> or PCM connector C-52 terminal 1 <A/T> when
checking No. 1 cylinder injector.
B-01B-05 B-26
b. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-
02 terminal 2 and ECM connector C-51 terminal 9 <M/
T> or PCM connector C-52 terminal 9 <A/T> when
checking No. 2 cylinder injector.
c. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-

T> or PCM connector C-52 terminal 24 <A/T> when
CONNECTOR : C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T> checking No. 3 cylinder injector.
d. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T> 06 terminal 2 and ECM connector C-51 terminal 2 <M/
T> or PCM connector C-52 terminal 2 <A/T> when
checking No. 4 cylinder injector.
e. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-
26 terminal 2 and ECM connector C-51 terminal10 <M/
T> or PCM connector C-52 terminal 10 <A/T> when
C-52 C-51 checking No. 5 cylinder injector.
AK000225AJ f. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-
25 terminal 2 and ECM connector C-51 terminal 25 <M/
T> or PCM connector C-52 terminal 25 <A/T> when
checking No. 6 cylinder injector.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
YES : Check the following items, and repair or replace the
defective items.
a. Check the ignition coil, spark plugs, spark plug
cables.
b. Check if the injectors are clogged.
c. Check if fuel is contaminated.
d. Check compression.
Then confirm that the malfunction symptom is
eliminated.
NO : Repair it. Then confirm that the malfunction symptom
is eliminated.

• Poor compression.
• Malfunction of the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T>.
