COMBINATION METERS ASSEMBLY AND VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR
TACHOMETER CHECK
M1543001000218
1. Attach an external high quality tachometer to the engine
TACHOMETER AC101133
speed detection connector on the harness side (such as
with a paper clip).
PAPER CLIP
NOTE: For tachometer check, use an external high quality
inductive tachometer.
2. Compare the readings of the vehicle tachometer and the
external tachometer at every engine speed, and check if the
variations are within the standard values.
ENGINE SPEED Standard values:
DETECTION CONNECTOR AC103124AB • 700 r/min: ±100 r/min
• 3,000 r/min: ±150 r/min
• 5,000 r/min: ±250 r/min
• 6,000 r/min: ±300 r/min
FUEL GAUGE UNIT CHECK
M1543001200201
Remove the fuel pump module and the remove the fuel gauge
unit. (Refer to GROUP 13C, Fuel Tank P.13C-11.)
FUEL GAUGE UNIT RESISTANCE
1. Check that resistance value between the fuel gauge terminal
and ground terminal is at the standard value when the fuel
gauge unit float is between point "F" (highest) and point "E"
(lowest).
FUEL GAUGE
GROUND Standard value:
• Point "F": 3 − 5 ohms
• Point "E": 110 − 112 ohms
2. Check that resistance value changes smoothly when the
float moves slowly between point "F" (highest) and point "E"
AC001290AB (lowest).
3. If all checks are correct, go to fuel gauge unit float height
check. If any check is not correct, replace the fuel gauge
unit.
FUEL GAUGE UNIT FLOAT HEIGHT
1. Move the float and measure height A at point "F" (highest)
POINT "F" (HIGHEST)
and B at point "E" (lowest) with the float arm touching
stopper.
Standard value:
• A: 180.3 mm (7.10 inches)
A ARM • B: 18.8 mm (0.74 inch)
2. Adjust the float arm to the standard value, then go to the
B
thermistor check.
