35A-6 BASIC BRAKE SYSTEM
BASIC BRAKE SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check disc brake pistons for smooth operation.
(1) With engine not running, depress the brake pedal rapidly
several times to deplete booster vacuum reserves.
(2) Test each disc brake assembly one at a time.
a. Remove the lower caliper bolt, then remove caliper from
mount.
b. Have an assistant slowly depress the brake pedal.
Confirm piston(s) extend slowly and smoothly with no
jumpiness. Repeat for each disc brake assembly.
Q:Does (do) the piston(s) move correctly?
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Disassemble and inspect brake assembly. (Refer to
P.35A-37 and/or P.35A-45.) Then go to Step 8.
STEP 6. Check brake disc(s) for run out (Refer to P.35A-25
or P.35A-26.).
Q:Is runout outside of specifications?
YES : Repair and replace as necessary. Then go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 7.
STEP 7. Check brake discs for correct thickness (Refer to
P.35A-27.).
Q:Is the thickness outside of specifications?
YES : Repair or replace as necessary. Then go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 8.
STEP 8. Check symptoms.
Q:Is the symptom eliminated?
YES : Repair complete.
NO : Start over at Step 1. If a new symptom appears, refer
to the symptom chart.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE 2: Insufficient Braking Power
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check whether the brake fluid is low, is the correct
fluid (A/T fluid, engine oil, etc.) or is contaminated (debris,
sand, etc.).
Q:Is there fault?
YES : Refill or replace with the specified brake fluid DOT 3
or DOT 4. Bleed the brakes if necessary (Refer to
P.35A-21). Then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 2.
