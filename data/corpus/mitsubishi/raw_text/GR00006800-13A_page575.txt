1. Start the engine and warm it up until the coolant is heated to
80°C (176°F) or higher. Then stop the engine.
2. Remove the air intake hose from the throttle body.
CAUTION
Do not allow cleaning solvent to enter the bypass passage.
3. Plug the bypass passage inlet (arrow) of the throttle body.
4. Spray cleaning solvent into the valve through the throttle
body intake port and leave it for approximately five minutes.
5. Start the engine, rev it several times and then idle it for
about one minute. If the idling speed becomes unstable (or if
the engine stalls) due to the bypass passage being plugged,
slightly open the throttle valve to keep the engine running.
6. If the throttle valve deposits are not removed, repeat steps 4
and 5.
