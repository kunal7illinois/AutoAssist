MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-179
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check the right bank heated oxygen sensor (rear).
(1) Disconnect right bank heated oxygen sensor (rear)
RIGHT BANK connector B-28 and connect test harness special tool,
HEATED OXYGEN MB991316, to the connector on the right bank heated
SENSOR (REAR)
oxygen (rear) sensor side.

(2) Measure the resistance between heated oxygen sensor
HEATED
connector terminal 1 (red clip) and terminal 3 (blue clip).
OXYGEN
SENSOR Standard value: 11 − 18 ohm [at 20°C (68°F)]
RED EQUIPMENT
Q:Is the resistance normal?
SIDE
CONNECTOR YES : Go to Step 3.
BLUE NO : Replace the right bank heated oxygen sensor (rear).
Then go to Step 12.

STEP 3. Check the power supply voltage at right bank
heated oxygen sensor (rear) harness side connector B-28.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-28 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
B-28 HARNESS (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
SIDE CONNECTOR
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 5.
