DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 13:
Intake Air Temperature Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
CONNECTOR : B-14
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
INTAKE AIR
(2) Remove the air intake hose from the volume air flow sensor.
TEMPERATURE
SENSOR (3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
13, Intake Air Temperature Sensor.

(5) Heating the sensor using a hair drier.
INTAKE AIR • The indicated temperature increases.
TEMPERATURE
NOTE: Do not allow it to increase over 80°C (176°F).
SENSOR
(6) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
(7) Attach the air intake hose.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
