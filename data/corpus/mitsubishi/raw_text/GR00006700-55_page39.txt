RESISTER CHECK
Use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance between the ter-
minals. Check that the measured value is at the standard
value.
Standard value:
MEASUREMENT TERMINAL STANDARD VALUE Ω
Between terminals 3 and 2 (LO) 2.3
Between terminals 3 and 4 (ML) 1.1
AC001402AB Between terminals 3 and 1 (MH) 0.4
BLOWER FAN AND MOTOR CHECK
When battery voltage is applied between the terminals, check
that the motor operates. Also, check that there is no abnormal
noise.
