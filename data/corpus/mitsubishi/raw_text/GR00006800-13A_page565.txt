MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-565
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
Standard wave pattern
(V)
50 POINT A
INJECTION COIL INDUCED
VOLTAGE (APPROXIMATELY 50-60 V)
POINT B:
INJECTOR DRIVE
TIME
POWER VOLTAGE
0 DRIVE SIGNAL:"ON" DRIVE SIGNAL:"OFF"
AKX01604AB
Wave Pattern Observation Points
Point A: Height of injector coil induced voltage.
CONTRAST WITH PROBABLE CAUSE
STANDARD WAVE
PATTERN
Injector coil induced voltage is Short in the injector solenoid
low or doesn’t appear at all
Point B: Injector drive time
1. The injector drive time should be synchronized with the
scan tool tester display.
2. When the engine is suddenly revved, the drive time will be
greatly extended at first, but the drive time will soon return
to original length.
