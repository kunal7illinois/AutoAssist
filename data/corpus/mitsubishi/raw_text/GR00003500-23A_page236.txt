relay connector A-17X.
(1) Disconnect the A/T control relay and measure at the
connector side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.

STEP 6. Check the continuity at A/T control relay
connector A-17X.
(1) Disconnect the A/T control relay and measure at the
connector side.
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 3 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
