BATTERY TESTING PROCEDURE
STEP 4. Check the open circuit voltage.
(1) Turn headlights on for 15 seconds.
STEP 1. Check the battery cables. (2) Turn headlights off for two minutes to allow
Remove the negative cable, then the positive cable. battery positive voltage to stabilize.
Check for dirty or corroded connections. (3) Disconnect the battery cables.
(4) Read open circuit voltage.
Q: Are the battery cables dirty or have corroded
connections? Q: Is open circuit voltage 12.4 volts or more?
YES : Clean the battery cables. Then go to Step 2. NO : Go to Step 5.
NO : Go to Step 2. YES : Go to Step 6.
STEP 2. Check the battery post. STEP 5. Charge battery.
Check for loose battery post.
Q: Charging the battery?
Q: Are the battery post faulty? YES : Charge the battery at 5 amps for 15 hours.
Yes : Replace the battery. Then go to Step 4. Then re-test, go to Step 4.
NO : Go to Step 3. NO : Go to Step 6.
STEP 3. Check the battery case and cover. STEP 6. Check the load test.
(1) Remove the hold-downs and shields. (1) Connect a load tester to the battery.
(2) Check for broken/cracked case or cover. (2) Load the battery at the recommended discharge
rate (See LOAD TEST RATE CHART) for 15
Q: Is the battery case or cover faulty?
seconds.
YES : Replace the battery. Then go to Step 4.
NO : Go to Step 4. (3) Read voltage after 15 seconds, then remove
load.
(4) Compare the measured value with the minimum
voltage. (See LOAD TEST CHART.)
Q: Is the voltage higher than minimum voltage?
NO : Replace the battery. Then go to Step 4.
YES : The battery is normal.
