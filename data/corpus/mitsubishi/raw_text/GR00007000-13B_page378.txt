13B-378 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3 Check the evaporative emission ventilation
solenoid.
(1) Disconnect the evaporative emission ventilation solenoid
CONNECTOR:D-10
connector D-10.
EVAPORATIVE EMISSION
VENTILATION SOLENOID
ACX02516AJ
(2) Measure the resistance between evaporative emission
ventilation solenoid side connector terminal 1 and 2.
EVAPORATIVE EMISSION
VENTILATION SOLENOID Standard value: 17 − 21 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
1 2 Q:Is the resistance at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the over vent valve module. Then go to Step
12.

STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at evaporative
emission ventilation solenoid harness side connector D-
10.
(1) Disconnect the connector D-10 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
D-10 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 6.
2 1 NO : Go to Step 5.
