causes for this case:)
If the vehicle does not backward when the selector
• Abnormal reverse clutch pressure
lever is shifted from "N" to "R" range while the engine
• Abnormal low-reverse brake pressure
is idling, the cause is probably abnormal pressure or
• Malfunction of the low-reverse solenoid valve
a malfunction of the reverse clutch, low-reverse
• Malfunction of the reverse clutch
brake, or valve body.
• Malfunction of the low-reverse brake
• Malfunction of the valve body
.
• Malfunction of the PCM
.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
.
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, carry out the actuator
test item 01: Low-Reverse Solenoid Valve.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
. (1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to actuator test mode for item 01:
Low-Reverse Solenoid Valve.
• An operation sound should be heard from solenoid
valve when solenoid valve is operated.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the solenoid valve operating properly?
16 PIN
YES : . Go to Step 2.
NO : . Repair or replace the low-reverse solenoid valve.

AC001252AB
Refer to GROUP 23B, Valve Body P.23B-74. Then
confirm that the symptom is eliminated.
STEP 2. Check the hydraulic pressure (for reverse clutch).
Measure the hydraulic pressure for reverse clutch when the
selector lever is at the "R" range, and check if the hydraulic
pressure is within the standard value. Refer to P.23A-26,
Hydraulic Pressure Test.
Q:Is the hydraulic pressure within the standard value?
YES : . Go to Step 3.
NO : . Go to Step 5.
STEP 3. Check the hydraulic pressure (for low-reverse
brake).
Measure the hydraulic pressure for low-reverse brake when the
selector lever is at the "R" range, and check if the hydraulic
pressure is within the standard value. Refer to P.23A-26,
Hydraulic Pressure Test.
Q:Is the hydraulic pressure within the standard value?
YES : . Go to Step 4.
NO : . Go to Step 5.
