MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 7. Check the ground voltage at barometric pressure
sensor connector B-14 by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector B-14.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 5 and ground by
backprobing.
• Voltage should be 0.5 volt or less.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

STEP 8. Check connector B-14 at the barometric pressure
sensor and connector C-51 at ECM <M/T> or connector C-
52 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-14
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
