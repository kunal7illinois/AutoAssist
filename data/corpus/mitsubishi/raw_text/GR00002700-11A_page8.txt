1. Before inspection, check that the engine oil, starter and
battery are normal. Also, set the vehicle in the following
condition:
• Engine coolant temperature: 80 − 95°C (176 − 203°F)
• Lights, and all accessories: OFF
• Transaxle: Neutral (P range on vehicles with A/T)
2. Disconnect the spark plug cables.
3. Remove all of the spark plugs.
4. Disconnect the crankshaft position sensor connector.
