13A-262 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the EGR solenoid.
(1) Disconnect the EGR solenoid connector B-31.
CONNECTOR:B-31
EGR
SOLENOID
VALVE
ACX02513AI
(2) Measure the resistance between EGR solenoid side
connector terminal 1 and 2.
Standard value: 29 − 35 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
Q:Is the resistance at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the EGR solenoid. Then go to Step 12.
AKX00352
STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at EGR solenoid
harness side connector B-31.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-31 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

SIDE CONNECTOR
Q:Is the voltage normal?
2 1 YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Go to Step 5.
AK000254AE
STEP 5. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Check connector B-13 at intermediate connector for
MFI RELAY damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connectors is in good condition,
repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
18X terminal 4 and EGR solenoid connector B-101
terminal 1 because of open circuit or short circuit to
ground. Then go to Step 12.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
AK101363AB
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
