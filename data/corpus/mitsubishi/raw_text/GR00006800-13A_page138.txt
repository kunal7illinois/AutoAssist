13A-138 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 11:
Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
11, Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
16 PIN • Warming up the engine. When the engine is revved, the
output voltage should be 0.6 to 1.0 volt.

• Warming up the engine. When the engine is idling, the
AKX01177AB
output voltage should repeat 0.4 volt and 0.6 to 1.0 volt
alternately.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check the heated oxygen sensor (front).
(1) Disconnect the heated oxygen sensor (front) connector B-
CONNECTOR: B-17
17 and connect test harness special tool, MD998464, to the
connector on the heated oxygen sensor (front) side.
(2) Warm up the engine until engine coolant 80°C (176°F) or
higher.
CAUTION
Be very careful when connecting the jumper wires; incor-
rect connection can damage the heated oxygen sensor
(front).

(3) Use the jumper wires to connect terminal 1 (red clip) to the
JUMPER positive battery terminal and terminal 3 (blue clip) to the
WIRES negative battery terminal.
BLACK (4) Connect a digital volt meter between terminal 2 (black clip)
RED and terminal 4 (white clip).
(5) While repeatedly revving the engine, measure the heated
oxygen sensor (front) output voltage.
WHITE BLUE Standard value: 0.6 − 1.0 volt
Q:Is the voltage at the standard value?

AKX01625AC YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the heated oxygen sensor (front). Then go to
Step 5.
