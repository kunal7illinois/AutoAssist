malfunction Short circuit to ground /open circuit)
NOTE: Do not replace the engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T>
until a through terminal check reveals there are no short/open circuits.
NOTE: Check that the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> ground circuit is normal before checking for the cause of
the problem.
NOTE: After the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> detects a malfunction, a diagnostic trouble code is recorded the
next time the engine is started and the same malfunction is re-detected. However, for items marked with a "*",
the diagnostic trouble code is recorded on the first detection of the malfunction.
NOTE: Sensor 1 indicates the sensor mounted at a position closest to the engine, and sensor 2 indicates the
sensor mounted at the position second closest to the engine.
NOTE: Bank 1 indicates the right bank side cylinder, and Bank 2 indicates the left bank side cylinder.
