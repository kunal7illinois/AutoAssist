HOW TO DIAGNOSE
CAUTION
Never use a test light for checking ECU-related circuits or
ECUs.
2. Self-powered test light
A self-powered test light consists of a bulb, battery and lead
wires connected in series. It is used to check continuity or
grounding.
ACX00940
3. Jumper wire
A jumper wire is used to close an open circuit.
CAUTION
Never use a jumper wire to connect a power supply
directly to a load.
ACX00941
4. Voltmeter
A voltmeter is used to measure the circuit voltage. Normally,
POWER LINE
the positive (red lead) probe is applied to the point of voltage
BLACK LEAD WIRE measurement and the negative (black lead) probe to the
body ground. Use a digital voltmeter to check for voltage
drop before or after a component.

5. Ohmmeter
An ohmmeter is used to check continuity or measure
resistance of a switch or coil. If the measuring range has
been changed, the zero point must be adjusted before
measurement.
