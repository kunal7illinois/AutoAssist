MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the evaporative emission purge solenoid.
(1) Disconnect the evaporative emission purge solenoid
CONNECTOR: B-33 <WITHOUT VARIABLE
INDUCTION SYSTEM> connector B-33.

(2) Measure the resistance between evaporative emission
purge solenoid side connector terminal 1 and 2.
Standard value: 30 − 34 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
Q:Is the resistance at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the evaporative emission purge solenoid.
Then go to Step 12.

STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at evaporative
emission purge solenoid harness side connector B-33.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-33 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
