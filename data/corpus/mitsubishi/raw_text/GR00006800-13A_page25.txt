MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-25
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
NOTE: .
Do not replace the engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T> until a
through terminal check reveals there are no short/open circuits.
Check that the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> ground circuit is normal before checking for the cause of the prob-
lem.
After the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> detects a malfunction, a diagnostic trouble code is recorded the next
time the engine is started and the same malfunction is re-detected. However, for items marked with a "*",
the diagnostic trouble code is recorded on the first detection of the malfunction.
Sensor 1 indicates the sensor mounted at a position closest to the engine, and sensor 2 indicates the sensor
mounted at the position second closest to the engine.

NOTE: Check that the engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T>
ground circuit is normal before checking for the cause of the problem.
