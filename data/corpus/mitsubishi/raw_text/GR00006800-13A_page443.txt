MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-443
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the power supply voltage ECM connector
C-53 <M/T> or PCM connector C-50 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-53 <M/T> or C-50 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 36 <M/T> or 22 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
3837363534333231 YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then confirm that the
4645444342414039
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
C-53 HARNESS NO : Check harness connectors C-28 at intermediate
SIDE CONNECTOR
connector for damage, and repair or replace as
required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector
AK000381AC
Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate connectors is in
<A/T> good condition, repair harness wire between
C-50 HARNESS combination meter connector C-41 terminal 41 and
SIDE CONNECTOR ECM connector C-53 terminal 36 <M/T> or PCM
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 connector C-50 terminal 22 <A/T> because of open
2322212019181716151413121110 9 circuit. Then confirm that the malfunction symptom is
3534 33323130 29282726 25 24
eliminated.
