CONNECTOR PIN INSPECTION
If the connector pin stopper is damaged, the terminal connec-
tions (male and female pins) will not be perfect even when the
connector body is connected, because the pins may pull out of
the back side of the connector. Therefore, gently pull the wires
one by one to make sure that no pins pull out of the connector.
