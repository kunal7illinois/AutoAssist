13A-94 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the sensor supply voltage at engine coolant
temperature sensor harness side connector B-11.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-11 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.5 and 4.9 volts.

STEP 4. Check the sensor supply voltage at ECM
connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM connector C-54 <A/T> by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the ECM connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-54 <A/T>.
(2) Disconnect the engine coolant temperature sensor
connector B-11.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Measure the voltage between terminal 83 <M/T> or 44 <A/
<M/T>
