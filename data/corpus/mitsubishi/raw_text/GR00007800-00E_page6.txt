HOW TO DIAGNOSE
Observe the symptom carefully. Check if there are also
other problems.
1 Observation of Problem Symptoms
In determining the probable causes, it is necessary to
study the wiring diagram to understand the circuit as a
2 Determination of Probable Causes
system. Knowledge of switches, relays and other parts is
necessary for accurate analysis. The causes of similar
problems in the past must be taken into account.
Troubleshooting is carried out by making step-by-step
Checking of Parts Associated with
checks until the cause is found.

of Faulty Parts
After the problems are corrected, be sure to check that the
system operates correctly. Also check that new problems
