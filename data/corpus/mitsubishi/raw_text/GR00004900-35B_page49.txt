DISCHARGED BATTERY
M1352003500257
The ABS system consumes a large amount of battery current
for its self-check function. If the battery is completely dis-
charged and booster cables are used to start the engine, the
engine must be allowed to idle for a few minutes to recharge. If
the battery does not recharge, the engine may misfire or stall.
FUSIBLE LINK
To prevent this condition, allow the engine to idle for a few min-
utes before driving the vehicle, or temporarily disable the ABS
BATTERY system by removing the fusible link for the ABS circuit. The
ABS warning light will illuminate when the ABS fusible link is
removed. After the battery is recharged, reinstall the ABS fus-
AC101134AF
ible link and check that the ABS warning light is not illuminated.
