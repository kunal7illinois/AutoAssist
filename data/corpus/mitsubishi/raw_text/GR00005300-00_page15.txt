FUSE
Remove the blown fuse and measure the resistance between
the load side of the blown fuse and the ground. Close the
switches of all circuits which are connected to this fuse. If the
resistance is almost 0 Ω at this time, there is a short some-
where between these switches and the load. If the resistance is
BATTERY not 0 Ω, there is no short at the present time, but a momentary
short has probably caused the fuse to blow.
The main causes of a short circuit are the following.
• Harness being clamped by the vehicle body
• Damage to the outer casing of the harness due to wear or
FUSE heat
• Water getting into the connector or circuitry
SHORT-
• Human error (mistakenly shorting a circuit, etc.)
