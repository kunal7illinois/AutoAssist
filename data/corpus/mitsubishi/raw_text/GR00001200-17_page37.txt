ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL 17-37
AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
STEP 9. Check the output circuit voltage at auto-cruise
control-ECU connector C-20 (terminal numbers 9 and 12)
by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 12 and ground by
backprobing.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.

9 10111213141516 • Voltage should be between 6.8 and 7.2 volts.
(MAIN switch is at the "ON" position.)
• Voltage should be between 3.5 and 5.0 volts.
(All switches are at the "OFF" position.)
AC103149AB
• Voltage should be between 0.4 and 2.3 volts.
("SET" switch is at the "ON" position.)
• Voltage should be between 2.3 and 3.5 volts.
("RESUME" switch is at the "ON" position.)
• Voltage should be between 1 volt or less.
("CANCEL" switch is at the "ON" position.)
(5) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage within specifications?
YES : Check that diagnostic trouble code 15 is not output.
If diagnostic trouble code 15 is output, replace the
auto-cruise control-ECU. (Refer to P.17-86.)
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 15 is not
output.
NO : Go to Step 10.
STEP 10. Check auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20.
Q:Is the connector damaged?
CONNECTOR: C-20
YES : Repair or replace connector.
Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection
P.00E-2.
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 15 is not
output.
NO : Go to Step 11.
AC001451AB
STEP 11. Check the clock spring.
Refer to GROUP 52B, Air Bag Modules and Clock Spring
P.52B-144.
Q:Is the clock spring damaged?
YES : Replace the clock spring.
Refer to GROUP 52B, Air Bag Modules and Clock
Spring P.52B-144.
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 15 is not
output.
NO : Go to Step 12.
