WARNING
• Before deployment, check carefully to be sure that
no one is nearby.
• The inflator will be quite hot immediately following
the deployment, so wait at least 30 minutes to
allow it to cool before attempting to handle it.
Although not poisonous, do not inhale gas from
air bag deployment. See Deployed Air Bag Module
Disposal Procedures (Refer to P.52B-167.) for
DEPLOYMENT WIRES post-deployment handling instructions.
ACX01315AB • If the air bag fails to deploy, do not go near the
module. Contact the MMSA Tech Line.
7. At a location as far away from the air bag module as
possible, and from a shielded position, disconnect the two
connected wires from each other, and connect them to the
two terminals of the battery (which has been removed from
the vehicle) to deploy the air bag.
8. Discard the deployed air bag module as specified in
Deployed Air Bag Module Disposal Procedures. (Refer to
P.52B-167.)
