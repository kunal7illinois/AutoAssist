5. Be careful that the piston boot does not become caught,
when lowering the caliper assembly and installing the guide
pin.
6. Check brake drag force as follows:
(1) Start the engine and hold the brake pedal down for five
seconds. [Pedal depression force: approximately 196 N
(44 pounds)]
(2) Stop the engine.
(3) Turn the brake disc forward ten times.
(4) Use a spring scale to measure the hub torque with pads
installed in the same direction as earlier.
(5) Calculate the drag force of the disc brake [difference
between hub torque with pads installed and hub torque
with pads removed].
Standard value: 69 N (16 pounds) or less
7. If the drag torque exceeds the standard value, disassemble
SPRING and clean the piston. Check for corrosion or worn piston
