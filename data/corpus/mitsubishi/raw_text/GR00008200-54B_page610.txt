54B-610 SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS)
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
CIRCUIT OPERATION TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION (COMMENT)
The ETACS-ECU receives signal through its receiver If the signal is not normal, the systems, which are
from the transmitter, and operates the keyless entry described in "CIRCUIT OPERATION", do not work
system according to the signal. normally.

TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• Malfunction of the transmitter
• Malfunction of the ETACS-ECU
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223: Test Harness Set
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Register the transmitter.
Replace the transmitter.Refer to GROUP 42, Keyless Entry
System, On-vehicle Service, How To Secret Registration
Method P.42-84.
Q:Can the transmitter be registered correctly?
YES : If the systems, which are described in "CIRCUIT
OPERATION", work normally, the input signal from
the transmitter should be normal.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check the transmitter battery.
Measure the voltage of the transmitter battery.
• The value should be approximately 2.5 - 3.2 volts.
Q:Does the measured voltage correspond with this range?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the battery. If the transmitter can be
registered normally, and the systems, which are
described in "CIRCUIT OPERATION", operate
normally, it indicates that the transmitter is sending
normal signal to the ECU.

STEP 3. Check the transmitter.
Substantial other transmitter in order to register encrypted
code.Refer to GROUP 42, Keyless Entry System, On-vehicle
Service, How To Secret Registration Method P.42-84.
Q:Can the transmitter be registered correctly?
YES : If the systems, which are described in "CIRCUIT
OPERATION", work normally, the input signal from
the transmitter should be normal.
NO : Replace the ETACS-ECU. If the systems, which are
described in "CIRCUIT OPERATION", work normally,
the input signal from the transmitter should be normal.
