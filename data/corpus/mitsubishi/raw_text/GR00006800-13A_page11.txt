TOOL
08 Evaporation ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EVAP Leak Mon. 0.5 × 0.032 kPa
leak monitor monitors the leak of fuel mm Pressure Value
(Very small evaporation gas by the reduction of Test Result and Limit
leak) vacuum in tank after appointed time Value (max.) kPa
using the fuel tank differential
pressure sensor after making the
fuel tank and the fuel line vacuum.
09 Heated oxygen ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> HO2S B1 SENSOR1 × 1count
sensor (front) monitors the deteriorated condition Rich/Lean switching
monitor (Rich/ of the heated oxygen sensor (front) Count
Lean switching) by checking the lean/rich switching Test Result and Limit
frequency of the heated oxygen Value (min.)
sensor (front).
0B Heated oxygen ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> checks HO2S B1 SENSOR2 × 19.5 mV
sensor (rear) the output voltage of the heated Change in Volt
monitor oxygen sensor (rear) in order to Test Result and Limit
(Voltage) monitor whether the heated oxygen Value (min.)
sensor (rear) output is stuck.
NOTE: .
*1: The test fails if test value is less than this value.
*2: The test fails if test value is greater than this value.
DIAGNOSTIC BY DIAGNOSTIC TEST MODE II
(INCREASED SENSITIVITY)
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
NOTE: When mode II is selected with MUT-II, the Service
Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator Lamp will light when the
engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control
module (PCM) <A/T> first detects the trouble (Note that this is
only for emission-related trouble). At the same time, the rele-
vant diagnostic trouble codes will be registered. In respect to
the comprehensive component electrical faults (opens/shorts),
the time for the diagnostic trouble code to be registered after
the fault occurrence is four seconds → one second. Therefore,
the confirmation of the trouble symptom and the confirmation
after completing repairs can be reduced. To return to the nor-
mal mode I after mode II has been selected once, the ignition
switch must be turned "OFF" once or mode I must be rese-
lected with MUT-II. The diagnostic trouble code, readiness test
status and freeze frame data, etc., will be erased when mode I
is returned to, so record these before returning to mode I.
