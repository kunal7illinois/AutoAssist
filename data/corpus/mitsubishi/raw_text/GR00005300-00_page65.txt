22. TIRES (ROTATE)
M1001008900187
Rotate tires regularly to equalize tire wear and help extend tire
life. Recommended tire rotation is every 12,000 km (7,500
miles) under normal driving conditions and every 9,600km
(6,000 miles) in severe driving conditions.
Timing for the rotation may vary according to vehicle condition,
road surface conditions, and individual driver’s habits.
When rotating tires, check for uneven wear, damage, and
wheel alignment. Abnormal wear is usually caused by incorrect
tire pressure, improper wheel alignment, out-of balance

wheels, or severe braking.
The first rotation is the most important to achieve more uniform
wear for all tires on the vehicle.
