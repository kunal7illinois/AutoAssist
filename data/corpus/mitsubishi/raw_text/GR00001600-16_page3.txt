GENERAL DESCRIPTION
M1161000100094
The charging system charges the battery with the
generator output to keep the battery charged at a
constant level during varying electrical load.
Operation
When the ignition switch is turned on, current flows in
VOLTAGE the field coil and initial excitation of the field coil
occurs.
When the stator coil begins to generate power after
the engine is started, the field coil is excited by the

output current of the stator coil.
14.4 V
The generator output voltage rises as the field cur-
rent increases and it falls as the field current
decreases. When the battery positive voltage (gener-
TIME ator S terminal voltage) reaches a regulated voltage

of approximately 14.4 V, the field current is cut off.
Rotation of the excited field coil generates AC volt-
