DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
.
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 54:
A/T Control Relay Output Voltage.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to data reading mode for item 54:
A/T Control Relay Output Voltage.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the relay operating properly?
