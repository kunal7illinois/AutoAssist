ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
IDLE AIR CONTROL MOTOR (STEPPER MOTOR)
CHECK
M1131005400075
Required Special Tool:
• MB991709: Test Harness Set
.
Checking the Operation Sound
1. Check that the engine coolant temperature is 20°C (68°F) or
below.
NOTE: If necessary, you can disconnect the engine coolant
temperature sensor connector and connect the harness-side
of the connector to another engine coolant temperature sen-
sor that is at 20°C (68°F) or below.
2. Check that the operation sound of the stepper motor can be
heard after the ignition is switched ON (but do not start the
engine).
3. If the operation sound cannot be heard, check the stepper
motor’s activation circuit. If the circuit is normal, it is
probable that there is a malfunction of the stepper motor or
engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control
module (PCM) <A/T>.
.
Checking the Coil Resistance
1. Disconnect the idle air control motor connector.
2. Measure resistance between terminal 2 and either terminal
1 or terminal 3 of the connector at the idle air control motor
side.
Standard value: 28 − 33 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
3. If resistance is not within the standard value, replace the IAC
motor.
4. Measure the resistance between terminal 5 and either
terminal 6 or terminal 4 of the connector at the idle air

Standard value: 28 − 33 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
5. If resistance is not within the standard value, replace the IAC
motor.
