23A-78 AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE
AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 15:
A/T Fluid Temperature Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Start the engine.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to data reading mode for item 15:
A/T Fluid Temperature Sensor.
• At cool condition: Almost equal to the ambient tempera-
ture (atmospheric temperature)
• At warm condition: 70 to 80°C (158°F to 176°F)
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
MB991502
AC001252AB YES : This malfunction is intermittent. Refer to GROUP 00,
How to Use Troubleshooting/Inspection Service
Points − How to Cope with Intermittent Malfunction
P.00-6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check the sensor output voltage at PCM
connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63 <3.0L Engine> by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63
CONNECTOR: C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
<3.0L Engine>.
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
PCM
C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>
AC001657BC
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 124 and ground by
C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
backprobing.
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>
• When A/T fluid temperature is 20°C (68°F), voltage
CONNECTOR HARNESS
SIDE VIEW should be between 3.8 and 4.0 volts.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 40°C (104°F), voltage
should be between 3.2 and 3.4 volts.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 80°C (176°F), voltage
should be between 1.7 and 1.9 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
AC001792AD Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Go to Step 5.
