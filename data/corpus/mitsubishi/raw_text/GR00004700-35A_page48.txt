PAD WEAR CHECK
WARNING
• Always replace both brake pads on each wheel as
a set (both front wheels or both rear wheels). Fail-
ure to do so will result in uneven braking, which
may cause unreliable brake operation.
• If there is significant difference in the thickness of
the pads on the left and right sides, check the slid-
ing condition of the piston, lock pin and guide pin.
Measure thickness at the thinnest and most worn area of the
pad. Replace the pad assembly if pad thickness is less than the
limit value.
Standard value: 10 mm (0.39 inch)
Minimum limit: 2.0 mm (0.08 inch)
