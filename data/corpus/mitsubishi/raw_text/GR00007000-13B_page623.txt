MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-623
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 14. Check the power supply voltage at ECM
connector C-51 <M/T> or PCM connector C-52 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-51 <M/T> or C-52 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 21 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.

3534 33323130 29282726 25 24 malfunction symptom is eliminated.
NO : Check harness connectors C-28 and C-108 at
intermediate connector for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to, GROUP 00E, Harness
AK000448AC Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
connectors are in good condition, repair harness wire
between fuel pump relay 2 connector C-105 terminal
2 and ECM connector C-51 terminal 21 <M/T> or
PCM connector C-52 terminal 21 <A/T> because of
open circuit. Then confirm that the malfunction
symptom is eliminated.
