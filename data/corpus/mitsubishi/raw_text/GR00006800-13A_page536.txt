CIRCUIT OPERATION
• The ignition coil is energized by Battery positive primary circuit of the ignition coil is energized by
grounding the ignition coil through terminal 2,
voltage from the ignition switch.
• When the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> turns off its causing the primary current to flow to the ignition
coil.
