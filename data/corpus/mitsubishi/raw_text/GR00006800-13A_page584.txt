Checking the Terminal Resistance
SENSOR SIDE CONNECTOR
1. Disconnect the throttle position sensor connector.
1 2 3 4
2. Measure resistance between the throttle position sensor
side connector terminal 1 and terminal 4.
Standard value: 3.5 − 6.5 kΩ
3. Measure resistance between the throttle position sensor
AKX01413AB side connector terminal 1 and terminal 3.
Normal condition:
Throttle valve slowly open Changes smoothly in
until fully open from the idle proportion to the opening
position angle of the throttle valve
4. If resistance is outside the standard value, or if it doesn’t
change smoothly, replace the throttle position sensor.
NOTE: After replacement, the throttle position sensor should
be adjusted. (Refer to P.13A-576.)
