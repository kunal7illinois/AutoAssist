35A-28 BASIC BRAKE SYSTEM
ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
<Rear>
1. Remove dirt and rust from the brake disc surface.
2. Measure the disc thickness at four positions or more.
Standard value: 10.0 mm (0.4 inch)
Minimum limit: 8.4 mm (0.33 inch)
NOTE: Thickness variation (at least 8 positions) should not
be more than 0.015 mm (0.0006 inch).
AC000892
CAUTION
• When the on-the-car type lathe is used, first install M12
flat washer on the stud bolt in the brake disc side
according to the figure, and then install the adapter. If
M12 FLAT WASHER
the adapter is installed with M12 flat washer not seated,
the brake disc rotor may be deformed, resulting in inac-
curate grinding.
• Grind the brake disc with all wheel nuts diagonally and
equally tightened to the specified torque 100 N⋅m (74 ft-
lb). When all numbers of wheel nuts are not used, or the
tightening torque is excessive or not equal, the brake
disc rotor or drum may be deformed, resulting in jud-
der.
3. If the disc is less than 8.4 mm (0.33 inch) thick, replace it
with a new one. If thickness variation exceeds the
M12 FLAT WASHER specification, turn rotor with an on-the-car brake lathe
("Accuturn-8750" or equivalent).
CAUTION
After a new brake disc is installed, always grind the brake
disc with on-the-car type brake lathe. If this step is not car-
ried out, the brake disc run-out exceeds the specified
AC006226AB value, resulting in judder.
4. If the calculated final thickness is less than the standard
value, replace the disc.
BRAKE LINING THICKNESS CHECK

NOTE: For brake lining thickness for drum-in-disc brake, refer
to GROUP 36, Parking Brake Drum − Inspection P.36-12.
1. Remove the brake drum.
