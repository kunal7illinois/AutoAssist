HEIGHT OF ZENER PROBABLE CAUSE
VOLTAGE
High Problem in zener diode
Low Abnormal resistance in
primary coil circuit
.
ABNORMAL WAVEFORMS EXAMPLES
Example 1
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is high and short.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is too large.
AKX00288
Example 2
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is low and long, and is sloping.
Also, the second half of the spark line is distorted. This
could be a result of misfiring.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is too small.
AKX00289
Example 3
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is low and long, and is sloping. However,
there is almost no spark line distortion.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is fouled.
