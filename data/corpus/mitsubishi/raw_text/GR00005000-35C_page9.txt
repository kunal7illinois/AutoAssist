DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223: Harness Set
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
• MB991529: Diagnostic Trouble Code Check Harness
.
STEP 1. Check the solenoid valve and motor power supply
circuit at the ABS-ECU connector A-02.
(1) Disconnect the ABS-ECU connector A-02 and measure at
the harness side.
(2) Measure the voltages between terminal 18 and ground, and
A-02 (HARNESS SIDE)
17 and ground.
Q:Are the voltages approximately 12 volts (battery
positive voltage)?
YES : Replace the hydraulic unit (integrated with ABS-
ECU). (Refer to GROUP 35B, Hydraulic Unit P.35B-
52.) Then go to Step 3.
NO : Go to Step 2.

STEP 2. Check the harness wire between the relay box
fusible link number 3 and the ABS-ECU connector A-02
(terminals 17 and 18).
NOTE: After inspecting the intermediate connector C-05,
CONNECTOR: C-05
inspect the wires. If the intermediate connector C-05 is dam-

aged, repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Con-
nector Inspection P.00E-2. If the connector has been repaired
or replaced, go to Step 3.
