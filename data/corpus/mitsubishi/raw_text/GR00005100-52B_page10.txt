52B-10 SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS)
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
.
SQUIB CIRCUIT CONNECTOR LOCK SWITCH
The switch is a mechanism that shorts the power supply terminal to the ground terminal automatically in the
air bag squib circuit when the connector is disconnected. A "short" spring is integrated inside the connector.
This spring prevents static electricity from flowing to the squib by shorting the power supply terminal to the
ground terminal (i.e. there is no potential difference between the two terminals).
CAUTION
When the connector is disconnected, there will be short circuit between the terminals. This is not a
fault.
