MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-213
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check the left bank heated oxygen sensor (front).
(1) Disconnect left bank heated oxygen sensor (front)
connector B-24 and connect test harness special tool,
LEFT BANK MD998464, to the connector on the left bank heated oxygen
HEATED OXYGEN
(front) sensor side.
SENSOR (FRONT)
ACX02489AI
CONNECTOR: B-24
AK103509AB
(2) Measure the resistance between heated oxygen sensor
HEATED
connector terminal 1 (red clip) and terminal 3 (blue clip).
OXYGEN
SENSOR Standard value: 4.5 − 8.0 ohm [at 20°C (68°F)]
EQUIPMENT
RED Q:Is the resistance normal?
SIDE
CONNECTOR YES : Go to Step 3.
BLUE NO : Replace the left bank heated oxygen sensor (front).
Then go to Step 12.

STEP 3. Check the power supply voltage at left bank
heated oxygen sensor (front) harness side connector B-24.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-24 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
