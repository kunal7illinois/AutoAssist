ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) 35B-17
ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) DIAGNOSIS
Q:Is any of the harness wires between the ABS-ECU
CONNECTOR: A-02
connector A-02 (terminals 1, 3, 8, and 9) and the wheel
speed sensor connector D-08 <rear: RH> (terminals 1
and 2) or D-09 <rear: LH> (terminals 1 and 2) damaged?
YES : Repair it and then go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 5.
HARNESS SIDE
AC001985AF
CONNECTORS: D-08, D-09, D-16
D-08 (HARNESS

STEP 5. Check each wheel speed sensor output voltage.
Refer to P.35B-46.
Output Voltage:
• When measured with a voltmeter: 42 mV or more
• When measured with oscilloscope (maximum voltage): 200
mV or more
Q:Does the voltage meet the specification?
YES : Replace the hydraulic unit (integrated with ABS-ECU)
and then go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 6.
STEP 6. Check the wheel speed sensors or ABS rotors.
Refer to P.35B-55. If there is a damage in any of the following
check items, replace the wheel speed sensor or the ABS rotor.
Check items:
• Wheel speed sensor internal resistance
Standard value: 1.28 − 1.92 kΩ
• Insulation between the wheel speed sensor body and the
connector terminals
• Toothed ABS rotor
Q:Is any of the wheel speed sensors or ABS rotors
damaged?
YES : Replace the faulty part and then go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 7.
