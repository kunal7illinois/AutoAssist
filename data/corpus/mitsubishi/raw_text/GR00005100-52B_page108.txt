CONNECTOR: C-74
module (LH) connector D-15, and measure at the wiring
harness side.
CAUTION

side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
weakened.
SRS-ECU (2) Check the continuity between the following terminals.
ACCELERATOR PEDAL C-74 connector D-15 connector
CENTER REINFORCEMENT (LH) AC000358AF 21 - 1
22 - 2
