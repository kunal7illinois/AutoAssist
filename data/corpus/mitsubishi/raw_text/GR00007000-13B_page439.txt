MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-439
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP5. Pressure test for leaks in the evaporator line from
hose F to hose P.
(1) Disconnect hose G from the evaporative emission
ventilation solenoid side, and plug the hoses.
(2) Remove the fuel cap.
HOSE G
AC002028AB
(3) Connect the evaporative emission system pressure pump
to the fuel filler neck.
(4) Apply a pressure on the evaporative emission system
pressure pump, and confirm that air is maintained.
NOTE: "Pressure test" in this procedure refers to the I/
M240 Simulation Test (8 simple steps) described in the
evaporative emission system pressure pump (Miller number
6872A) manufacture’s instructions located in the lid of the
pump box.
AC000186 (5) Disconnect the evaporative emission system pressure
pump, and reinstall the fuel cap.
(6) Connect hose G to the evaporator line.
Q:Is air maintained?
YES : Go to Step 16.
NO : Go to Step 6.
STEP 6. Pressure test for leaks in the evaporator line from
hose I to hose P.
(1) Disconnect hose I from the evaporative emission canister
HOSE I
side, and plug the hose.
(2) Perform the pressure test again.
Q:Is air maintained?
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 7.
