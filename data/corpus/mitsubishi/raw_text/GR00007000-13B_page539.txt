MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-539
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the power supply voltage ECM connector
C-51 <M/T> or PCM connector C-52 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-51 <M/T> or C-52 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 22 and ground.
C-51<M/T>,C-52<A/T> • Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
HARNESS SIDE (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

3534 33323130 29282726 25 24 malfunction symptom is eliminated.
NO : Check harness connectors C-28 at intermediate
connector for damage, and repair or replace as
required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector
AKX01508AE Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate connectors is in
good condition, repair harness wire between
combination meter connector C-41 terminal 41 and
ECM connector C-51 terminal 22 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-52 terminal 22 <A/T> because of open
circuit. Then confirm that the malfunction symptom is
eliminated.
