MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Using scan tool MB991502, check solenoid for
clogging of the purge control.
(1) Disconnect hoses B and C from the evaporative emission
<VEHICLE WITHOUT VARIABLE
INDUCTION SYSTEM> purge solenoid side, and connect the hand vacuum pump to
HOSE B EVAPORATIVE the evaporative emission purge solenoid instead of hose C.
EMISSION (2) Set scan tool MB991502 to actuator test mode for item 08:
PURGE Evaporative Emission Purge Solenoid. When the
SOLENOID
evaporative emission purge solenoid is operated, apply a
pressure on the hand vacuum pump and confirm that air is
