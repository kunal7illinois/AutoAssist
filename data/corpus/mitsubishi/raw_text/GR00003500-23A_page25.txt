Do not let anybody stand in front of or behind the
vehicle while this test is being carried out.
1. Check the A/T fluid level and temperature. Check the engine
coolant temperature.
• A/T fluid level: At the "HOT" mark on the dipstick
• A/T fluid temperature: 70 − 80 °C (158 − 176 °F)
• Engine coolant temperature: 80 − 100 °C (176 − 212 °F)
NOTE: It measures A/T fluid temperature in scan tool (MUT-II).

CAUTION
• The throttle should not be left fully open for any more
than five seconds.
• If you repeat the stall test when the fluid temperature is
80°C (176°F) or more, move the selector lever to the "N"
range and let the engine run at approximately 1,000 r/
min for at least one minute and then wait until the ATF
temperature returns to 80°C (176°F) or lower.
Standard value: Stall speed: 2,100 − 2,600 r/min
7. Move the selector lever to the "R" position and repeat step
6.
Standard value: Stall speed: 2,100 − 2,600 r/min
