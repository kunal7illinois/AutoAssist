13B-38 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the power supply voltage at volume air flow
sensor harness side connector B-14.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-14 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 4 and ground.
B-14 HARNESS • Voltage should be battery positive voltage.

Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
18X terminal 4 and volume air flow sensor connector
B-14 terminal 4 because of open circuit or short circuit
to ground. Then go to Step 13.
