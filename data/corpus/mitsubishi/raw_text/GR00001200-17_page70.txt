17-70 ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL
AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
STEP 2. Check the auto-cruise vacuum pump.
(1) Disconnect the vacuum hose from the auto-cruise vacuum
pump and connect a vacuum gauge to the vacuum pump.
(2) Disconnect the vacuum pump connector.
(3) Check the auto-cruise vacuum pump and valves according
VACUUM to the following procedure:
GAUGE • Connect the positive battery terminal to auto-cruise vac-
uum pump connector terminal 1, and the negative bat-
tery terminal to terminals 2, 3, and 4.
Then the vacuum gauge should read 27 kPa (8.0 in Hg)
or more.
• The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.
Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 2 is disconnected from the negative bat-
tery terminal while terminals 1, and 3 remain connected.
• The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.
CONTROL RELEASE
VALVE VALVE Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 3 is disconnected from the negative bat-
tery terminal while terminals 1, and 2 remain connected.
Q:Are all of the above values satisfied?
ACX01181AB
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the auto-cruise vacuum pump. (Refer to
P.17-86.)
Then that the malfunction is eliminated.
STEP 3. Check the vacuum actuator.
(1) Disconnect the vacuum hose from the vacuum actuator,
and then connect a hand vacuum pump to the vacuum
THROTTLE BODY
actuator.
(2) Apply a vacuum and check that the throttle lever moves and
the vacuum is maintained.
Q:Is the vacuum actuator damaged?
YES : Replace the vacuum actuator.
For 2.4L engine, refer to GROUP 13A, Throttle Body
Assembly P.13A-593.
VACUUM ACTUATOR
AC001493AB For 3.0L engine, refer to GROUP 13B, Throttle Body
Assembly P.13B-690.
Then check that the malfunction is eliminated.
NO : Check that the malfunction is eliminated.
If the malfunction is not eliminated, replace the auto-
cruise control-ECU. (Refer to P.17-86.)
Then check that the malfunction is eliminated.
