AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
STEP 18. Check the switch output voltage at PCM
connector C-61 by backprobing. ("2" position) <Vehicles
without sport mode>
Measure the voltage between terminal 122 and ground by
backprobing.
C-61 CONNECTOR • When selector lever position is "P," voltage should be 0.5
HARNESS SIDE VIEW
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "R," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "N," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "D," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
AC001908AI
• When selector lever position is "3," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "2," voltage should be bat-
tery positive voltage.
• When selector lever position is "L," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 19.
NO : Tern the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Repair harness damage between the Park/Neutral
position switch connector B-41 terminal 2 and PCM
connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63 <3.0L
Engine> terminal 122.
STEP 19. Check the switch output voltage at PCM
connector C-61 by backprobing. ("L" position) <Vehicles
without sport mode>
Measure the voltage between terminal 110 and ground by
backprobing.
• When selector lever position is "P," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "R," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "N," voltage should be 0.5
C-61 CONNECTOR volt or less.
HARNESS SIDE VIEW • When selector lever position is "D," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
AC001946AI
• When selector lever position is "3," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "2," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "L," voltage should be bat-
tery positive voltage.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 20.
NO : Tern the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Repair harness damage between the Park/Neutral
position switch connector B-41 terminal 6 and PCM
connector C-61 terminal 110.
