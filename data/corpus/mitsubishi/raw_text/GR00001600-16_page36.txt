SPARK PLUG CABLE TEST
M1163000900074
<3.0L ENGINE>
WARNING
Wear rubber gloves while performing this test.
1. Disconnect, one at a time, each of the spark plug cables
while the engine is idling to check whether the engine’s
running performance changes or not.
2. If the engine performance does not change, check the
resistance of the spark plug cable, and check the spark plug
itself.

IGNITION COIL CHECK
M1163001200205
<2.4L ENGINE − With built-in ignition power
transistor>
Check by the following procedure, and replace the coil if there
is a malfunction.
.
SECONDARY COIL RESISTANCE CHECK
Measure the resistance between the high-voltage terminals of
the ignition coil.
Standard value: 8.5 − 11.5 kΩ

PRIMARY COIL AND IGNITION POWER TRANSISTOR
CONTINUITY CHECK
NOTE: An analog-type ohmmeter should be used.
NOTE: Connect the negative probe of the ohmmeter to termi-
1.5 V nal 1.
CAUTION
This test must be performed quickly (in less than 10 sec-
– + 1 2 3 onds) to prevent coil from burning and ignition power tran-
sistor from breaking.
As described in the chart below, perform a continuity check on
the ignition coil and power transistor.
