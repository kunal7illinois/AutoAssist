MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-73
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the intake air temperature sensor.
(1) Disconnect the intake air temperature sensor connector B-
CONNECTOR : B-14
14.

TEMPERATURE
SENSOR
ACX02480AG
(2) Measure the resistance between intake air temperature
sensor side connector terminal 5 and 6.

YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the volume air flow sensor. Then go to Step
11.

STEP 4. Check the sensor supply voltage at intake air
temperature sensor harness side connector B-14.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-14 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 6 and ground.
B-14 HARNESS • Voltage should be between 4.5 and 4.9 volts.

Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 5.
