<3.0L ENGINE>
1. Measurement of the primary coil resistance
Measure the resistance between connector terminals 1 and
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
2 of the distributor.
Standard value: 0.56 − 0.68 Ω
2. Measurement of the secondary coil resistance
Measure the resistance between the high-voltage terminal
and connector terminal 1.
HIGH-VOLTAGE Standard value: 9.4 − 12.8 kΩ

<3.0L ENGINE>
.NOTE: An analog-type ohmmeter should be used.
NOTE: Connect the negative probe of the ohmmeter to termi-
nal 2.
1.5 V
CAUTION
– + This test must be performed quickly (in less than 10 sec-
onds) to prevent coil from burning and ignition power tran-
sistor from breaking.
As described in the chart below, perform a continuity check on
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
the ignition coil power transistor. Replace the ignition power
transistor if there is a malfunction.
