DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 14:
Throttle Position Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
14, Throttle Position Sensor.
16 PIN • With the throttle valve in the idle position, voltage should
be between 0.535 and 0.735 volt.
MB991502
• With the throttle valve in the full-open position, voltage
AKX01177AB
should be between 4.5 and 5.5 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
