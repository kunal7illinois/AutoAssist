PROVISIONAL DTCs [MUT-II OBD-II Test Mode −
Results (Mode 5)]
The MUT-II will display the Provisional DTCs reported by
engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control
module (PCM) <A/T> if the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> detects
some malfunction for "Misfire", "Fuel System" and "Compre-
hensive" monitoring during a SINGLE Driving Cycle. The
intended use of this data is to assist the technician after a vehi-
cle repair, and after clearing diagnostic information, by report-
ing test result after a SINGLE Driving Cycle. Note that the test
results reported by this mode do not necessarily indicate a
faulty component/system. If test results indicate a failure after
ADDITIONAL (consecutive) driving, then the MIL will be illumi-
nated and a DTC will set.
