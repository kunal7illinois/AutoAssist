The circuit of each system from the fuse (or fusible link) to ground is shown. The power supply is shown at
the top and the ground at the bottom to facilitate understanding of how the current flows.
Indicates connector number.
Indicates power source.
The same number as used in the
wiring harness diagram.

Each circuit diagram consists of
block(s). The blocks are divided
by page number.
Indicates splice point numbers.
These numbers are identical to
those described in "Splice Loca-
tions."
Indicates the circuit name to be
connected. The arrow indicates
the current flow direction.
Indicates the power suppply in
the control unit. If no voltage is
displayed, this indicates battery
positive voltage.
An "X" at the end of a connector
number indicates that the conn-
ector is connected to a central-
ized junction that is shown in the
section "Centralized Junction."
Indicates that the diagram contin-

block in the same circuit.
Indicates the connector symbol.
Connectors in the circuit diagram
are indicated in numerical order.
Indicates the operating conditions Indicates shield wire. Indicates that current
of the engine coolant switch, etc. flows upwards.
