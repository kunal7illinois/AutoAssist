SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-505
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 2. Check the driver’s door switch.
Remove the driver’s door switch.Then check the continuity
CONNECTOR <ECLIPSE>: D-11
between the switch terminal and the switch body.

Released 1 − 2 Less than 2 ohm
Pressed 1 − 2 Open circuit
Q:Is the driver’s door switch in good condition?
AC106483AH
YES : Go to Step 3.
CONNECTOR <ECLIPSE SPYDER>: D-11 NO : Replace the driver’s door switch. If the functions,
which are described in "CIRCUIT OPERATION", work
normally, the input signal from the driver’s door switch
should be normal.

STEP 3. Measure at the lower metal part of the driver’s
door switch in order to check the ground circuit to the
driver’s door switch.
NOTE: Check that the driver’s door switch is grounded to the
vehicle body by means of its mounting screw.
Remove the cap, and measure the resistance value between
the lower metal part and the ground.
• The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.
METAL PART
Q:Does the measured resistance value correspond with
this range?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Check the fit of the switch, and repair if necessary. If
the functions, which are described in "CIRCUIT
OPERATION", work normally, the input signal from
CUP
ACX01600AB the driver’s door switch should be normal.
