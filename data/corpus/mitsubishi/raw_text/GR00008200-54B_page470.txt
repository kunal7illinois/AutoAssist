54B-470 SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS)
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223: Test Harness Set
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Measure at ETACS-ECU connector C-119 in order
to check the line from the ignition switch (IG1) to the
ETACS-ECU.
(1) Disconnect ETACS-ECU connector C-119, and measure at
CONNECTOR: C-119 the junction block side.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 8 and ground.
• The measured value should be approximately 12 volts
(battery positive voltage).
Q:Does the measured voltage correspond with this range?
CONNECTOR C-119 YES : Replace the ETACS-ECU. If the functions, which are
(JUNCTION BLOCK SIDE) described in "CIRCUIT OPERATION", work normally,
the input signal from the ignition switch (IG1) should
be normal.
NO : Go to Step 2.

JUNCTION BLOCK functions, which are described in "CIRCUIT
(REAR VIEW)
OPERATION", work normally, the input signal from
the ignition switch (IG1) should be normal.
