AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
LINE PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT
M1231001700156
1. Drain the A/T fluid.
NOTE: Be sure to perform the hydraulic pressure test before
attempting any adjustments.
2. Remove the valve body cover.
3. Turn the adjusting screw shown in the illustration to adjust
the line pressure to the standard value. The pressure
increases when the screw is turned to the left.
NOTE: When adjusting the line pressure, adjust to the mid-
dle of the standard value range.
ADJUSTING Standard value: 1.01 − 1.05 MPa (147 − 152 psi)
SCREW
4. Install the valve body cover. Pour in one quart A/T fluid.
5. Repeat the hydraulic pressure test. (Refer to P.23A-26.)
Readjust the line pressure if necessary.
