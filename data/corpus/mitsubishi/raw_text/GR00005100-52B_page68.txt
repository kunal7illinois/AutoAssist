STEP 2. Check the clock spring.
(1) Disconnect the negative battery terminal.
(2) Disconnect the clock spring connector C-85.
(3) Connect special tool MB991865 to special tool MB991866.
DUMMY RESISTOR (3Ω)
(MB991865) RESISTOR HARNESS CAUTION
(MB991866) Do not insert a test probe into the terminal from its front
side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
weakened.
(4) Insert special tool MB991866 into clock spring harness side

side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
SRS-ECU weakened.
ACCELERATOR PEDAL (5) Measure the voltage between terminals 7, 8 and body
CENTER REINFORCEMENT(LH)AC000358AD ground
• Voltage should be 0 volt.
CONNECTOR: C-85
Q:Is the voltage normal?
CLOCK
YES : Erase the DTC memory, and recheck if any DTC sets.
