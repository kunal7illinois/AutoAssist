MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-13
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
NOTE: If the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> detects multiple malfunctions, the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> stores
the data for only the first item that was detected.
However, if the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> detects a misfire or a fuel system malfunction, ECM <M/T> or
PCM <A/T> stores the data by giving priority to the misfire or fuel system malfunction, regardless of the order
in which the malfunction was detected.
NOTE: As for diagnostic trouble code P1603, "freeze frame" data is not memorized.

OBD- II DRIVE CYCLE
All kinds of diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) can be monitored by carrying out a test drive according to the fol-
lowing six drive cycle pattern. In other words, doing such a drive regenerates any kind of trouble which
involves illuminating the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator Lamp and verifies the repair procedure
has eliminated the trouble (the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator Lamp is no longer illuminated).
CAUTION
Two technicians should always be in the vehicle when carrying out a test drive.
NOTE: Check that the diagnosis trouble code (DTC) is not output before traveling in the drive cycle pattern.
Erase the DTC if it has been output.
