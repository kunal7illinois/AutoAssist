CAUTION
Insert an insulator such as a cable tie to a depth of 4mm
(0.16 inch) or more, otherwise the short bar will not cable
tie release.
(3) Insert a cable tie [3 mm (0.12 inch) wide, 0.5 mm (0.02 inch)
thick] between terminals 23, 24 and the short bar to release
the short bar.
(4) Measure at the wiring harness side.
CAUTION
Do not insert a test probe into the terminal from its front
side directly as the connector contact pressure may be

weakened.
(5) Check the continuity between terminals 23 and 24.
• There should be open circuit.
Q:Is the continuity normal?
YES : Erase the DTC memory, and recheck if any DTC sets.
