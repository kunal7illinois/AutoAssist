DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check actuator test
item 29: Evaporative Emission Ventilation Solenoid.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the actuator test mode for item
29, Evaporative emission ventilation solenoid.
16 PIN • An operation sound should be heard and vibration
should be felt when the evaporative emission ventilation
MB991502
solenoid is operated.

(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the solenoid operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2 Check connector D-10 at the evaporative emission
ventilation solenoid for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:D-10
EVAPORATIVE EMISSION YES : Go to Step 3.
VENTILATION SOLENOID NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
