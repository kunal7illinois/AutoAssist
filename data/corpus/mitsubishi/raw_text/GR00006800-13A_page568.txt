13A-568 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
Example 2
OPEN • Cause of problem
CIRCUIT
Open circuit in the line between the idle air control motor
SIDE
and the ECM or PCM.
• Wave pattern characteristics
Current is not supplied to the motor coil on the open circuit
side. (Voltage does not drop to 0 volt.) Furthermore, the
induced electromotive force wave pattern at the normal side
NORMAL
SIDE is slightly different from the normal wave pattern.
