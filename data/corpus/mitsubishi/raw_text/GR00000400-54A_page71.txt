CHASSIS ELECTRICAL 54A-71
COMBINATION METERS ASSEMBLY AND VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR
STEP 39. Check the sensor output voltage at output shaft
speed sensor connector B-38.
(1) Disconnect connector B-38 and measure at the harness
CONNECTOR: B-38
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to "ON" position.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground.
HARNESS
• The measured value should be between 4.9 and 5.1
CONNECTOR: B-38
volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Does the measured voltage correspond with this range?
YES : Go to Step 40.
NO : Repair it because of harness open circuit between
output shaft speed sensor connector B-38 terminal 2
and PCM connector C-61 <2.4L-A/T>, C-63 <3.0L-A/
T> terminal 104.

STEP 40. Check the power supply voltage at output shaft
speed sensor connector B-38.
(1) Disconnect connector B-38 and measure at the harness
CONNECTOR: B-38
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to "ON" position.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
HARNESS
• The measured value should be 12 volts (battery positive
CONNECTOR: B-38
voltage).
(4) Turn the ignition switch to "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Does the measured voltage correspond with this range?
YES : Go to Step 43.
NO : Go to Step 41.
