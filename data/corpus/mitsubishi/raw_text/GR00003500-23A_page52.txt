AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check the sensor output voltage at throttle
position sensor connector B-07 by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect connector B-07.
CONNECTOR: B-07
<2.4L ENGINE> <3.0L ENGINE> (2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground by
backprobing.
• With the throttle valve in idle position, voltage should be
B-07 CONNECTOR
between 0.535 and 0.735 volts.
HARNESS SIDE VIEW
• With the throttle valve in full-open position, voltage
should be between 4.5 and 5.5 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 3.
AC001548AC NO : Go to Step 7.
STEP 3. Check the sensor output voltage at PCM
connector C-57 <2.4L Engine> or C-59 <3.0L Engine> by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect connector C-57 <2.4L Engine> or C-59
CONNECTOR: C-57 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
<3.0L Engine>.
C-59 <3.0L ENGINE>
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 78 and ground by
backprobing.
• With the throttle valve in idle position, voltage should be
between 0.535 and 0.735 volts.
• With the throttle valve in full-open position, voltage
should be between 4.5 and 5.5 volts.
