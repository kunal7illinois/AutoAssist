MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-537
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely • Improper connector contact, open circuit or short-
causes for this case: ) circuited harness wire.
• Malfunction of the ignition coil. • Malfunction of the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T>.
• Malfunction of the ignition power transistor.
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check the ignition coil.
Refer to GROUP 16, Ignition System − On-vehicle service −
Ignition Coil Check P.16-36.
Q:Are there any abnormalities?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Replace the ignition coil. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 2. Check harness connector B-16, B-21 at ignition
coil for damage.
Q:Is the harness connector in good condition?
CONNECTORS : B-16, B-21
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
B-21 B-16 malfunction symptom is eliminated.
AAKK000000336622AB
STEP 3. Check the power supply voltage at ignition coil
connectors B-16, B-21.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-16, B-21 and measure at the
harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
B-16, B-21
HARNESS SIDE (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
CONNECTOR
Q:Is the voltage normal?
3 2 1 YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Check the connector C-07, C-89, C-108 and C-111 at
intermediate connectors for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
AK000414AB connector are in good condition, repair harness wire
between ignition switch connectors C-87 terminal 2
and ignition coil connectors B-16, B-21 terminals 1
because of open circuit. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
