13B-474 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 8. Check connector B-39 at vehicle speed sensor for
damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-39
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 17.
AK101597AB
STEP 9. Check the power supply voltage at vehicle speed
sensor harness side connector B-39.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-39 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
B-39 HARNESS
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
SIDE CONNECTOR
Q:Is the voltage normal?
3 2 1
YES : Go to Step 10.
NO : Check connectors B-36, C-28, C-78, C-112 and C-111
at intermediate connector for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
AKX01425AD connectors are in good condition, repair harness wire
between ignition switch connector C-87 terminal 2
and vehicle speed sensor connector B-39 terminal 1
because of open circuit or short circuit to ground.
Then go to Step 17.
STEP 10. Check the continuity at vehicle speed sensor
harness side connector B-39.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-39 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 2 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
B-39 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR Q:Is the continuity normal?
YES : Go to Step 11.
3 2 1
NO : Check connector B-36 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.13B-
6. If intermediate connector is in good condition,
repair harness wire between vehicle speed sensor
AKX01426AG connector B-39 terminal 2 and ground because of
open circuit or harness damage. Then go to Step 17.
