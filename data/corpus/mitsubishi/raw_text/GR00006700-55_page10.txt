MANUAL A/C DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check each A/C part.
Refer to Inspection Procedure 1.
Q:Is the A/C operating properly?
YES : This diagnosis is complete. (If no malfunctions are not
found in all steps, an intermittent malfunction is
suspected. Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use
Troubleshooting/Inspection Service Points − How to
Cope with Intermittent Malfunction P.00-6.)
NO : Go to Step 1.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE 3: When the A/C is Operating, Temperature Inside the Passenger
Compartment does not Decrease (Cool Air not Emitted).
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check for refrigerant leaks.
Q:Is the refrigerant leaking?
YES : Repair. Then go to Step 6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check the dual pressure switch operation.
