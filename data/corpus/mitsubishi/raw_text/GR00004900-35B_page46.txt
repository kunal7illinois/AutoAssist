35B-46 ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS)
ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
WHEEL SPEED SENSOR OUTPUT VOLTAGE
MEASUREMENT
M1352001600225
Required Special Tool:
MB991219: Inspection Harness
1. Lift up the vehicle and release the parking brake.
2. Disconnect the ABS-ECU connector, and then use special
ABS-ECU CONNECTOR tool MB991219 to measure the output voltage at the
(HARNESS SIDE)
harness side connector.
TERMINAL NO.

3. Manually turn the wheel to be measured 1/2 to 1 turn/
second. Measure the output voltage with a voltmeter or
oscilloscope.
NOTE: Check the connection of the sensor harness and
connector before using the oscilloscope.
Output voltage:
• Minimal voltmeter reading: 42 mV
• Maximum voltmeter reading: 300 mV
• Minimal oscilloscope reading: 120 mV
• Maximum oscilloscope reading: 600 mV
Probable causes of low output voltage
• Wheel speed sensor pole piece-to-ABS rotor clearance too
large
• Faulty wheel speed sensor
4. To observe the waveform with an oscilloscope:
• Front Wheels: Shift into low gear and drive the wheels.
• Rear Wheels: Turn the wheels manually at a constant
speed
WHEN TURNED MANUALLY NOTE: The output waveform is low when the wheel speed is
low. Similarly, it will be higher as the wheel speed increases.
Waveform may also be observed by driving the vehicle.
