CONNECTOR CONTINUITY AND VOLTAGE TEST
Required Special Tools:
• MB991219: Test Harness Set
• MD998459: Test Harness
Follow the steps below to avoid causing poor connector contact
and/or reduced waterproof performance of connectors when
checking continuity and/or voltage at connectors of waterproof
connectors.
CAUTION
Never backprobing a waterproof connector. Backprobing a
MD998459
connector may cause the terminals to corrode, deteriorat-
ing circuit performance.
1. If the circuit is to be checked in the closed state of use a
special tool like MD998459.
AC000014AB
CAUTION
Forcing the probe into the terminal may open the terminal,
causing intermittent or poor contact and creating an open
circuit.
2. If the connector is disconnected for checking and the facing
part is the female pin side, use an appropriate male terminal
for checking the contact pressure of connector pins (like
MB991219).
MB991219
CAUTION
Do not simultaneously contact more than one terminal
AC000015 AB with the probe. Contacting two or more terminals at the
same time may damage a circuit, possibly to the point of
starting an electrical fire.
3. If the facing part is the male pin side, either carefully touch
the probe to the pin so it does not accidently contact other
pins, or use an appropriate female terminal.
IMPROPER TERMINAL ENGAGEMENT CHECK
Terminals inside a connector may not engage properly even if
the connectors engage. Make sure that each terminal does not
come out of the connector when gently pulling each harness
wire. If it does, repair or replace the terminal and/or connector.
