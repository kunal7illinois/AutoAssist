35C-24 TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM (TCL)
TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM (TCL) DIAGNOSIS
.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991223: Harness Set
.
STEP 1. Check the TCL warning light circuit at the ABS-
ECU connector A-02.
(1) Disconnect the ABS-ECU connector A-02 and measure at
the harness side.
(2) Ground the terminal 20.
A-02 (HARNESS SIDE)
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
Q:Does the TCL warning light illuminate?
YES : Replace the hydraulic unit (integrated with ABS-ECU)
(Refer to GROUP 35B, Hydraulic Unit P.35B-52.) and
then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 2.
AC000970AB
STEP 2. Check the TCL warning light bulb.
(1) Remove the combination meter. (Refer to GROUP 54A,
Combination Meter P.54A-105 and P.54A-107.)
(2) Check the TCL warning light bulb.
Q:Is the TCL warning light bulb burned out?
YES : Replace the bulb and then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 3.
STEP 3. Check the combination meter for the continuity.
(1) Remove the combination meter.
(2) Remove the TCL warning light bulb. Then measure the
resistance between the bulb terminals.
(3) Install the TCL warning light bulb to the combination meter,
CONNECTOR C-41 and then measure the resistance between the connector C-
41 terminals 52 and 42. The resistance reading at this time
41424344454647 484950515253545556
should be much the same as the resistance measured at
step (2).
Q:Are the two resistance values extremely different each
other?
YES : Replace the combination meter (printed circuit board)
and then go to Step 9.
AC004565AB NO (much the same) : Go to Step 4.
