MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-429
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 17. Check the harness wire between intermediate
connector D-16 terminal 6 and fuel tank differential
pressure sensor connector D-18 terminal 2 for damage.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
CONNECTOR: D-16
YES : Replace the fuel tank differential pressure sensor.
Then go to Step 22.
NO : Repair it. Then go to 22.

STEP 18. Check the output circuit voltage at fuel tank
differential pressure sensor connector D-18.
(1) Remove the center exhaust pipe. (Refer to GROUP 15,
Exhaust Pipe, Main Muffler and Catalytic Converter P.15-
22.)
(2) Remove the fuel band assembly, tilt the fuel tank.
(3) Disconnect fuel tank differential pressure sensor connector
D-18.
(4) Use special tool (MB991658) to connect terminals 1, 2 and
3 of the disconnected sensor connector and those of the
harness side connector respectively.

(5) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(6) Remove the fuel cap.
(7) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 2.0 and 3.0 volts.
(8) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

PRESSURE SENSOR Q:Is the voltage normal?
AC002081AB YES : Remove the special tool and connect fuel tank
differential pressure sensor connector D-18. Then go
to Step 19.
NO : Replace the fuel tank differential pressure sensor.
Then go to 22.
