52B-26 SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS)
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
CIRCUIT OPERATION DTC SET CONDITIONS
• The SRS-ECU judges how severe a collision is • This DTC is set if there is abnormal resistance
by detecting signals from the front air bag analog between the input terminals of the driver’s side air
G-sensor. If the impact is over a predetermined bag module (squib). The most likely causes for
level, the SRS-ECU outputs an ignition signal. At this code to be set are shown in the table below:
this time, if the front air bag safing G-sensor is on, However, if no DTC resets, the SRS warning light
the SRS air bag will inflate. will be switched off (DTC will be retained).
• The ignition signal is input to the air bag module

via the clock spring to inflate the air bag.
• Improper engaged connector or defective short
bar*
• Short circuit in the clock spring
• Short circuit between the driver’s air bag module
(squib) circuit terminals
• Damaged connector(s)
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
NOTE: *: The squib circuit connectors integrate a "short" bar (which prevents the air bag from deploying unin-
tentionally due to static electricity by shorting the positive wire to the ground wire in the squib circuit when the
connectors are disconnected) (Refer to P.52B-20.) Therefore, if the connector C-72, C-85 or C-81 is dam-
aged or improperly engaged, the short bar may not be released when the connector is connected.

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
• MB991613: SRS Check Harness
• MB991865: Dummy resister
• MB991866: Resister harness
STEP 1. Check the DTC.
Q:Is DTC 34 output?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Go to Step 3.
STEP 2. Check the SRS-ECU connector C-72.
Q:Is the connector correctly engaged?
CONNECTOR: C-72
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Engage the connector correctly. Then go to Step 9.
