CAUTION
The steel ball spring is extremely weak, so the lash
adjuster’s functionality may be lost if the air bleed wire is
pushed in hard.
3. While gently pushing down the internal steel ball using wire
[0.5 mm (0.020 inch) in diameter] or special tool MD998442,
move the plunger through five to ten strokes until it slides
DIESEL FUEL smoothly. In addition to eliminating stiffness in the plunger,
this operation will remove dirty oil.

AKX00628AB appears otherwise abnormal, replace the lash adjuster.
4. Remove the lash adjuster from the container. Then, push
