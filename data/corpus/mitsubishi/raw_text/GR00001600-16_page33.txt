pinion should rotate smoothly in one direction, but should
not rotate in opposite direction. If the clutch does not
function properly, replace the overrunning clutch assembly.
FREE 2. Inspect the pinion for wear or burrs. If the pinion is worn or
burred, replace the overrunning clutch assembly. If the
pinion is damaged, also inspect the ring gear for wear or
burrs.

ARMATURE CHECK
1. Check that the armature coil is not grounded.
GROWLER
2. Place the armature in a growler.
3. Hold a thin steel blade parallel and just above while rotating
the armature slowly in the growler. A shorted armature will
cause a blade to vibrate and be attracted to the core.
Replace the shorted armature.
