1. When replacing the windshield, temporarily set the
windshield against the body, and place a mating mark on the
windshield and body.
2. Use 3M(cid:1) AAD Part number 8906 or equivalent to de grease
the inside and outside of the windshield and the body
flanges.
CAUTION
• The primer strengthens the adhesive, so be sure to
apply it evenly around the entire circumference. How-
ever, a too thick application will weaken the adhesive.
• Do not touch the coated surface.
3. Soak a sponge in the primer, and apply evenly to the
windshield and the body in the specified places.
4. Apply the primer, and then let it dry for 3 to 30 minutes,
depending on ambient temperature and humidity.
