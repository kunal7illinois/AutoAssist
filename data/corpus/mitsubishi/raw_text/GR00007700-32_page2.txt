The engine-transaxle mount is of an inertial axis sup-
porting type whose excellent features have already
been proven in many Mitsubishi vehicles. The inertial
axis supporting type mount supports the front upper
part of the engine at the front and the rear upper part
of the transaxle at the rear. This arrangement effec-
tively suppresses the engine vibration.
