MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-667
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
Measurement Method
1. Disconnect the idle air control motor connector, and connect
OSCILLOSCOPE
IDEL AIR CONTROL the test harness special tool (MB991709) in between. (All
MOTOR CONNECTOR
terminals should be connected.)

Wave Pattern Observation Points
1. Check that the standard wave pattern appears when the
idle air control motor is operating.
Point A:
Presence or absence of induced electromotive force from the
motor turning. (Refer to abnormal wave pattern.)
