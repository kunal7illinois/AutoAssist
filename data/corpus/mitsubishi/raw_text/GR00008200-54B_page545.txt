SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-545
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 8. Check the front passenger’s door lock key
cylinder switch.
Disconnect front passenger’s door lock key cylinder switch con-
nector E-06. Then check continuity between the switch termi-
CONNECTOR: E-06
FRONT DOOR (RH) nals.
SWITCH TESTER SPECIFIED
POSITION CONNECTION CONDITION
LOCK 1 − 2 Less than 2 ohm
Neutral (OFF) 1 − 2 - 3 Open circuit
UNLOCK 2 − 3 Less than 2 ohm
Q:Is the front passenger’s door lock key cylinder switch in
good condition?
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Replace the front passenger’s door lock key cylinder
switch. If the systems, which are described in
"CIRCUIT OPERATION", work normally, the input
signal from the front passenger’s door lock key
cylinder switch should be normal.

STEP 9. Measure at front passenger’s door lock key
cylinder switch connector E-06 in order to check the
ground circuit to the front passenger’s door lock key
cylinder switch.
(1) Disconnect front passenger’s door lock key cylinder switch
CONNECTOR: E-06 connector E-06, and measure at the harness side.
