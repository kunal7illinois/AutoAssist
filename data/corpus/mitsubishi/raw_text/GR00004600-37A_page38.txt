mm (0.03 inch) per one turn.
NOTE: Do not turn the adjusting bolt more than one turn.
Standard value (W): 1.9 mm (0.07 inch)
ADJUSTING BOLT
<When more than 1.9 mm (0.07 inch)>: Screw in the
ACX01164AB
adjusting bolt.

3. Check that crimped width (A) is within the standard value.
Standard value (A): 1.4 − 1.8 mm (0.06 − 0.07 inch)
<When more than 1.8 mm (0.07 inch)>: Readjust the
A
dimension (W) of step (1) to the value calculated by
the following equation, and repeat step (2).
W = 5.5 mm (0.22 inch) − A [Example: if (A) is 1.9 mm
(0.07 inch), (W) is 3.6 mm (0.14 inch).]
<When less than 1.4 mm (0.06 inch)>: Remove the bel-
lows band, readjust the dimension (W) of step (1) to
ACX01166AB the value calculated by the following equation, and
use a new bellows band to repeat steps (2) to (3).
W = 5.5 mm (0.22 inch) − A [Example: if (A) is 1.3 mm
(0.05 inch), (W) is 4.2 mm (0.17 inch).]
