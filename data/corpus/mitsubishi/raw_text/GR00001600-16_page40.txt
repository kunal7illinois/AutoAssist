.MEASUREMENT METHOD
1. Clamp the spark plug cable (Number 1 or 3) with the
secondary pickup.
NOTE: Because of the two-cylinder simultaneous ignition
system, the waves for two cylinders in each group appear
during wave observation. However, wave observation is car-
ried out for the cylinder (Number 1 or 3) with the spark plug
cable which has been clamped by the secondary pickup.
NOTE: Identification of which cylinder wave pattern is dis-
played can be difficult, but the wave pattern of the cylinder
which is clamped by the secondary pickup will be stable, so
this can be used as a reference.
2. Clamp the spark plug cable (Number 1 or 3) with the trigger
pickup.
NOTE: Clamp the same spark plug cable as the one which
has been clamped by the secondary pickup.
