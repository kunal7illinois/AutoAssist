13A-370 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Pressure test for evaporator line from hose D to
hose N.
(1) Remove the module bracket mounting bolts, and
disconnect hose E from the evaporative emission
ventilation solenoid side, and plug the hoses from which the
hoses have been disconnected.
(2) Confirm that the evaporative emission system pressure
pump (Miller number 6872A) is operating properly. Perform
the self-test as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.

(3) Connect an evaporative emission system pressure pump to
the fuel filler neck.
(4) Pressure test the system to determine whether any leaks
are present.
NOTE: "Pressure test" in this procedure refers to the I/
M240 Simulation Test (8 simple steps) described in the
evaporative emission system pressure pump (Miller number
6872A) manufacturer’s instructions located in the lid of the
pump box.
AC000186 Q:Are the evaporator line in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 17.
NO : Go to Step 7.
STEP 7. Pressure test for evaporator line from hose G to
hose N.
(1) Disconnect hose G from the evaporative emission canister
HOSE G
side, and plug the hose from which the pipes have been
disconnected.
(2) Perform the pressure test again.
Q:Are the evaporator line in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 10.
