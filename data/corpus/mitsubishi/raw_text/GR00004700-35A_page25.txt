CAUTION
• When the on-the-car type lathe is used, first install M12
flat washer on the stud bolt in the brake disc side
according to the figure, and then install the adapter. If
M12 FLAT WASHER
the adapter is installed with M12 flat washer not seated,
the brake disc rotor may be deformed, resulting in inac-
curate grinding.
• Grind the brake disc with all wheel nuts diagonally and
equally tightened to the specified torque 100 N⋅m (74 ft-
lb). When all numbers of wheel nuts are not used, or the
tightening torque is excessive or not equal, the brake
disc rotor or drum may be deformed, resulting in jud-
der.
4. If the run-out of the brake disc is limit value or more, turn
rotor with an on-car type brake lathe ("Accuturn-8750" or
M12 FLAT WASHER equivalent). If it still exceeds the limit, inspect hub end play.
Limit: 0.05 mm (0.002 inch)
CAUTION
After a new brake disc is installed, always grind the brake
disc with on-the-car type brake lathe. If this step is not car-
ried out, the brake disc run-out exceeds the specified
AC006226AB
value, resulting in judder.
5. If the play exceeds the limit, check the hub. If the play does
not exceed the limit, replace the brake disc.
