MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-513
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the variable induction control solenoid.
(1) Disconnect the variable induction control solenoid
CONNECTOR: B-49
connector B-49.
VARIABLE INDUCTION
CONTROL SOLENOID
AK103101AC
(2) Measure the resistance between variable induction control
solenoid side connector terminal 1 and 2.
Standard value: 29 − 35 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
Q:Is the resistance at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the variable induction control solenoid. Then
go to Step 12.

STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at variable
induction control solenoid harness side connector B-49.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-49 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
B-49 HARNESS (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
SIDE CONNECTOR
Q:Is the voltage normal?
2 1
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Go to Step 5.

STEP 5. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
MFI RELAY 18X terminal 4 and variable induction control solenoid
connector B-49 terminal 1 because of open circuit or
short circuit to ground. Then go to Step 12.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
