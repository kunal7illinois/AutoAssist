CHECK VALVE OPERATION CHECK
M1351009000194
CAUTION
The check valve should not be removed from the vacuum
hose.
1. Remove the vacuum hose. (Refer to P.35A-32.)
CAUTION
If the check valve is defective, replace it as an assembly
unit together with the vacuum hose.
2. Check the operation of the check valve by using a vacuum

1. Connect two pressure gauges, one each to the input side
PRESSURE GAUGE and output side of the proportioning valve, as shown.
2. Air bleed the brake line and the pressure gauge.
3. While gradually depressing the brake pedal, make the
following measurements and check to be sure that the
measured values are within the allowable range.
PROPORTIONING VALVE AC000874AB
(1) Output fluid pressure begins to drop relative to input fluid
pressure (split point).
SPLIT POINT
Standard value:
<2.4L engine> 3.7 − 4.2 MPa (537 − 609 psi)
<3.0L engine> 3.2 − 3.7 MPa (464 − 537 psi)
OUTPUT
FLUID (2) Check that the output fluid pressure is at standard value
PRESSURE
when the input fluid pressure indicates 9.8 MPa (1,422
psi).
INPUT FLUID PRESSURE Standard value:
AC000875AB <2.4L engine> 5.0 − 5.8 MPa (725 − 841 psi)
<3.0L engine> 4.6 − 5.4 MPa (667 − 783 psi)
(3) Output fluid pressure difference between left and right
brake lines.
Limit: 0.8 MPa (116 psi)
4. If the measured fluid pressures are not within allowable
ranges, replace the proportioning valve.
