ENGINE COOLANT LEAK CHECK
M1141001000173
WARNING
When pressure testing the cooling system, slowly
release cooling system pressure to avoid getting
burned by hot coolant.
CAUTION
• Be sure to completely clean away any moisture from
the places checked.
• When the tester is taken out, be careful not to spill any
coolant from it.
• Be careful when installing and removing the tester and
when testing not to deform the filler neck of the radia-
tor.
1. Check that the coolant level is up to the filler neck. Install a
radiator cap tester and apply 160 kPa (23 psi) pressure, and
CAP ADAPTER
then check for leakage from the radiator hose or
connections.
ADAPTER 2. If there is leakage, repair or replace the appropriate part.

RADIATOR CAP PRESSURE CHECK
M1141001300215
NOTE: Be sure that the cap is clean before testing, since rust
or other foreign material on the cap seal will cause an improper
indication.
1. Use a cap adapter to attach the cap to the tester.
2. Increase the pressure until the indicator of the gauge stops
moving.
CAP ADAPTER
Minimum limit: 64 kPa (9.2 psi)
Standard value: 73 − 103 kPa (11 − 15 psi)
3. Replace the radiator cap if the reading does not remain at or
above the limit.
