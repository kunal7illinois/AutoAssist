BASIC BRAKE SYSTEM 35A-27
ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
(3) If the play does not exceed the limit install the brake disc
at a different phase, and then check the run-out of the
brake disc again.
5. If the run-out cannot be corrected by changing the phase of
the brake disc, replace the disc.

BRAKE DISC THICKNESS CHECK

<Front>
1. Remove dirt and rust from the brake disc surface.
2. Using a micrometer, measure disc thickness at eight
positions, approximately 45 degrees apart and 10 mm (0.4
inch) in from the outer edge of the disc.
<2.4L ENGINE>
Standard value: 24.0 mm (0.9 inch)
Minimum limit: 22.4 mm (0.88 inch)
<3.0L ENGINE>
Standard value: 26.0 mm (1.02 inch)
Minimum limit: 24.4 mm (0.96 inch)
ACX00668AB NOTE: Thickness variation (at least 8 positions) should not
be more than 0.015 mm (0.0006 inch).
CAUTION
• When the on-the-car type lathe is used, first install M12
flat washer on the stud bolt in the brake disc side
according to the figure, and then install the adapter. If
M12 FLAT WASHER
the adapter is installed with M12 flat washer not seated,
the brake disc rotor may be deformed, resulting in inac-
curate grinding.
• Grind the brake disc with all wheel nuts diagonally and
equally tightened to the specified torque 100 N⋅m (74 ft-
lb). When all numbers of wheel nuts are not used, or the
tightening torque is excessive or not equal, the brake
disc rotor or drum may be deformed, resulting in jud-
der.
3. If the disc thickness is less than the limits, replace it with a
new one. If thickness variation exceeds the specification,
M12 FLAT WASHER turn rotor with an on-the-car type brake lathe ("Accuturn-
8750" or equivalent).
CAUTION
After a new brake disc is installed, always grind the brake
disc with on-the-car type brake lathe. If this step is not car-
ried out, the brake disc run-out exceeds the specified
AC006226AB value, resulting in judder.
4. If the calculated final thickness after turning the rotor is less
than the standard value, replace the disc.
