Hard starting Engine starts after cranking a while.
Idling stability Hunting Engine speed doesn’t remain constant; changes at idle.
Rough idle Usually, a judgement can be based upon the movement of the
tachometer pointer, and the vibration transmitted to the steering wheel,
shift lever, body, etc.
Incorrect idle The engine doesn’t idle at the usual correct speed.
speed
Engine stall (die The engine stalls when the foot is taken from the accelerator pedal,
