HARNESS SIDE
YES : Replace the front-ECU. When the passing switch is
AC101421AB
turned "ON", the headlights (low-beam and high-
beam) should illuminate normally.
NO : Refer to Inspection Procedure O-7 "ETACS-ECU
does not receive a signal from the passing switch
P.54B-511."
INSPECTION PROCEDURE J-5: Headlight, Tail Light: Headlights do not Illuminate When the Lighting
Switch is at "AUTO," "TAIL," and "PASSING" Position, but Illuminate at Low-beam when the Switch is
