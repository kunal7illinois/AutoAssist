MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
DIAGNOSTIC BY DIAGNOSTIC TEST MODE II
(INCREASED SENSITIVITY)
Refer to GROUP 13A, Trouble code diagnosis − Diagnostic by
Diagnostic Test Mode II (Increased Sensitivity) P.13A-5.
INSPECTION USING SCAN TOOL MB991502,
DATA LIST AND ACTUATOR TESTING
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
1. Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
2. Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
3. Carry out inspection by means of the data list and the
actuator test function. If there is an abnormality, check and
16 PIN
repair the chassis harnesses and components. Refer to
MB991502 Data List Reference Table. Refer to Actuator Test Reference
AKX01177AB Table P.13B-654.
4. Re-check using scan tool MB991502 and check to be sure
that the abnormal input and output have returned to normal
because of the repairs.
5. Erase the diagnostic trouble code (s).
6. Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
7. Disconnect scan tool MB991502 from the data link
connector.
8. Start the engine again and do a test drive to confirm that the
problem is eliminated.
ON-BOARD DIAGNOSTICS
The engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T> monitors the input/out-
put signals (some signals all the time and others under specified conditions) of the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/
T>. When a malfunction continues for a specified time or longer after the irregular signal is initially monitored,
the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> judges that a malfunction has occurred. After the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T>
first detects a malfunction, a diagnostic trouble code is recorded when the engine is restarted and the same
malfunction is re-detected. However, for items marked with a "*", a diagnostic trouble code is recorded on the
first detection of the malfunction. There are 92 diagnostic items. The diagnostic results can be read out with a
scan tool. Since memorization of the diagnostic trouble codes is backed up directly by the battery, the diag-
nostic results are memorized even if the ignition key is turned off. The diagnostic trouble codes will, however,
be erased when the battery terminal or the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> connector is disconnected. In addition,
the diagnostic trouble code can also be erased by turning the ignition switch to "ON" position and sending the
diagnostic trouble code erase signal from scan tool MUT-II (MB991502) to the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T>.
NOTE: If the sensor connector is disconnected with the ignition switch turned on, the diagnostic trouble code
is memorized. In this case, send the diagnostic trouble code erase signal to the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> in
order to erase the diagnostic memory.
The 92 diagnostic items are all indicated sequentially from the smallest code number. The ECM <M/T> or
PCM <A/T> records the engine operating condition when the diagnostic trouble code is set. This data is
called "freeze frame" data. This data can be read by using the scan tool, and can then be used in simulation
tests for troubleshooting. Data items are as follows.
