SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-363
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 14. Check the rear turn-signal light bulb (LH).
(1) Remove the rear turn-signal (LH) light bulb.
(2) Check that the rear turn-signal light bulb (LH) is not broken.
Q: Is the rear turn-signal (LH) light bulb in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 15.
NO : Replace the rear turn-signal (LH) light bulb.Check that
the turn-signal lights illuminate normally.
STEP 15. Measure at rear combination light (LH) connector
F-17 in order to check the ground circuit to the rear
combination light (LH).
(1) Disconnect rear combination light (LH) connector F-17, and
