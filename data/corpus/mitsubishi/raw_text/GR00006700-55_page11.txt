MANUAL A/C DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the refrigerant-temperature switch
operation.
Q:When the A/C is off, check that there is continuity
between the refrigerant-temperature switch terminals. Is
the circuit open loop?
YES : Replace the switch. Then go to Step 6.
NO : If less than 2 ohm, go to Step 4.

STEP 4. Measure the automatic compressor controller
terminal voltage.
Q:Is the automatic compressor controller terminal voltage
in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Replace. Then go to Step 6.
STEP 5. Measure the engine control module <M/T>/the
powertrain control module <A/T> terminal voltage.
(1) Refer to GROUP 13A, Diagnosis − Check at The Engine
Control Module (ECM) <M/T> or Powertrain Control Module
(PCM) <A/T> <2.4L engine>P.13A-554 .
(2) Refer to GROUP 13B, Diagnosis − Check at The Engine
Control Module (ECM) <M/T> or Powertrain Control Module
(PCM) <A/T> <3.0L engine>P.13B-655 .
Q:Is the voltage in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Replace. Then go to Step 6.
STEP 6. Check symptoms.
Q:Is the cool air discharged?
YES : This diagnosis is complete. (If no malfunctions are not
found in all steps, an intermittent malfunction is
suspected. Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use
Troubleshooting/Inspection Service Points − How to
Cope with Intermittent Malfunction P.00-6.)
NO : Go to Step 1.
