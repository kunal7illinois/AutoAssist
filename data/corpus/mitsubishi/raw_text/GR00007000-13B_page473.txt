MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-473
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 24:
Vehicle Speed Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Start the engine.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
24, Vehicle Speed Sensor.
16 PIN • Check that the speedometer and MUT-II display speed
match when traveling at a vehicle speed of 40 km/h (25
MB991502
mph).

(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00E-2.
NO : Replace the ECM. Then go to Step 17.
STEP 6. Check the sensor supply voltage at ECM
connector C-62 by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the ECM connector C-62.
(2) Disconnect the vehicle speed sensor connector B-39.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Measure the voltage between terminal 80 and ground by
backprobing.
C-62 CONNECTOR • Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts.

STEP 7. Check connector C-62 at ECM for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:C-62
ECM YES : Check connector B-36 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connector is in good condition,
repair harness wire between vehicle speed sensor
connector B-39 terminal 3 and ECM connector C-62
terminal 80 because of open circuit. Then go to Step
C-62 17.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
AK000310AC
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 17.
