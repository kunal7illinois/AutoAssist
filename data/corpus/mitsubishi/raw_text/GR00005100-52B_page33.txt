STEP 2. Check the clock spring.
(1) Disconnect the negative battery terminal.
(2) Disconnect the clock spring connector C-85.
(3) Connect special tool MB991865 to special tool MB991866.
DUMMY RESISTOR (3Ω)
(MB991865) RESISTOR HARNESS CAUTION
(MB991866) Do not insert a test probe into the terminal from its front
side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
weakened.
(4) Insert special tool MB991866 into clock spring harness side
connector C-85 (terminal No.3 and 4) by backprobing.

NO : Replace the clock spring. Refer to P.52B-144. Then
go to Step 4.
STEP 3. Check the harness between the SRS-ECU and the
clock spring for open circuit.
(1) Disconnect SRS-ECU connector C-72 and clock spring
CONNECTOR: C-72
connector C-85, and measure at the wiring harness side.
CAUTION
Do not insert a test probe into the terminal from its front
side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
weakened.
(2) Check the continuity between the following terminals.
SRS-ECU C-72 connector C-85 connector
ACCELERATOR PEDAL 7 - 3
CENTER REINFORCEMENT(LH)AC000358AD 8 - 4
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
CONNECTOR: C-85
Q:Is the continuity normal?
CLOCK
YES : Eras the DTC memory, and recheck if any DTC sets.
SPRING
If DTC 22 sets, replace the SRS-ECU. Refer to
P.52B-142. Then go to Step 4.
NO : Repair the harness wires between SRS-ECU
