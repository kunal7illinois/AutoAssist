13B-254 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 21:
Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
(1) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
21, Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
• The engine coolant temperature and temperature
shown with the scan tool should approximately match.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
16 PIN
YES : Go to Step 4.
MB991502 NO : Refer to DTC P0116 − Engine Coolant Temperature
AKX01177AB Circuit Range/Performance Problem P.13B-77, DTC
P0117 − Engine Coolant Temperature Circuit Low
Input P.13B-85, DTC P0118 − Engine Coolant
Temperature Circuit High Input P.13B-89.
STEP 4. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 25:
Barometric Pressure Sensor.
(1) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
25, Barometric Pressure Sensor.
• When altitude is 0 m (0 foot), 101 kPa.
• When altitude is 600 m (1,969 feet), 95 kPa.
• When altitude is 1,200 m (3,937 feet), 88 kPa.
• When altitude is 1,800 m (5,906 feet), 81 kPa.
16 PIN (3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
MB991502 Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
AKX01177AB YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Refer to DTC P0106 − Barometric Pressure Circuit
Range/Performance Problem P.13B-42, DTC P0107
− Barometric Pressure Circuit Low Input P.13B-46,
DTC P0108 − Barometric Pressure Circuit High Input
P.13B-56.
STEP 5. Check connector B-48 at injector intermediate
connector for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:B-48
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 10.
