MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-411
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the power supply voltage at power steering
pressure switch harness side connector B-19.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-19 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

STEP 7. Check the power supply voltage at ECM connector
C-53 <M/T> or PCM connector C-54 <A/T> by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the ECM connector C-53 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-54 <A/T>.
(2) Disconnect the power steering pressure switch connector
B-19.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Measure the voltage between terminal 37 <M/T> or 52 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground by backprobing.
• Voltage should be between battery positive voltage.
(5) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
