(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.5 and 4.9 volts.
HARNESS (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
CONNECTOR: B-42
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 13.
NO : Repair harness open circuit or damage between input
shaft speed sensor connector B-42 terminal 2 and
PCM connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63 <3.0L
Engine> terminal 103.
