MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-279
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check connector D-17 at the fuel temperature
sensor for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:D-17
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 11.

STEP 3. Check the fuel temperature sensor.
(1) Disconnect the fuel temperature sensor connector D-17
(2) Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 3 of the fuel
FUEL TEMPERATURE SENSOR
temperature sensor.
SIDE CONNECTOR
Standard value:
11 22 33 0.5 − 12.0 kΩ
44 55
Q:Is the resistance at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the fuel temperature sensor. Then go to Step
11.

STEP 4. Check the sensor supply voltage at fuel
temperature sensor harness side connector D-17.
(1) Disconnect the connector D-17 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
D-17 HARNESS • Voltage should be between 4.5 and 4.9 volts

Q:Is the voltage normal?
55 44
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 5.
