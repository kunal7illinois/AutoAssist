COMBINATION METERS ASSEMBLY AND VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR
STEP 8. Check the fuel gauge unit.
(1) Remove the fuel pump module from the fuel tank. (Refer to
GROUP 13C, Fuel Tank P.13C-11.
(2) Check resistance value between terminals 2 and 1 is at
standard value when the fuel gauge unit float is at point "F"
(highest) and point "E" (lowest).
(3) Check that the resistance value changes smoothly when
the float moves slowly between point "F" (highest) and "E"
(lowest).
Q:Is the resistance 3 − 5 ohms (at point "F") and 110 − 112
ohms (at point "E")?
YES : Repair or replace the combination meter (printed-
circuit board or fuel gauge assembly). The fuel gauge
POINT "F"
should work normally.
NO : Replace the fuel gauge unit. The fuel gauge should
work normally.
