CIRCUIT OPERATION
• A coil built into the output shaft speed sensor If the output signal from the output shaft speed sen-
sor has been lost for one second or more while the
generates a pulse signal at both ends of this coil
vehicle is being driven, it is judged to be an open cir-
when the output shaft rotates. The pulse signal
cuit or short circuit in the output shaft speed sensor
frequency increases with a rise in output shaft
circuit and diagnostic trouble code number "23" is

• Both ends of the coil are connected to the PCM set. If diagnostic trouble code number "23" is output
four times, the transaxle is locked into 3rd gear or
(terminals 16 and 104) via the output shaft speed
2nd gear as a fail-safe measure, and the "N" range
sensor connector (terminals 1 and 2).
• The PCM detects the output shaft speed by the light flashes once per second.
