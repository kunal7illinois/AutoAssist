MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-435
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
CONNECTOR: C-108 CONNECTOR:C-89
AK101420AD AK000345AE
. COMMENT
CIRCUIT OPERATION
• A battery positive voltage is applied on the data • The cause is probably a defect in power supply
system (including ground) for the on-board diag-
link connector power terminal (terminal 16). The
nostic test mode line.
ground terminals (terminal 4, 5) are grounded to
the vehicle body.
.
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely
. causes for this case: )
• Malfunction of the data link connector.
• Damaged harness wire.
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check the power supply voltage at data link
connector C-29.
(1) Measure voltage between terminal 16 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.

NO : Check harness connectors C-108, C-113 and C-89 at
intermediate connector for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
connectors are in good condition, repair harness wire
AKX01430AF between fusible link (1) and data link connector C-29
terminal 16 because of open circuit. Then confirm that
the malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 2. Check the continuity at data link connector C-29.
(1) Check for the continuity between terminal 4, 5 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
Q:Is the continuity normal?
YES : Replace the scan tool. Then confirm that the
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
910111213141516 malfunction symptom is eliminated.
NO : Repair harness wire between data link connector C-
C-29 HARNESS
SIDE CONECTOR 29 terminal 4, 5 and ground because of open circuit or
harness damage. Then confirm that the malfunction
symptom is eliminated.
