SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-473
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223: Test Harness Set
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Check the fog light switch.
Remove the fog light switch.Then check continuity between the
CONNECTOR: C-76 switch terminals.
SWITCH TESTER SPECIFIED
POSITION CONNECTION CONDITION
Released 6 − 7 Open circuit
Pressed 6 − 7 Less than 2 ohm
Q:Is the fog light switch in good condition?
C-76 YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair the fog light switch. If the for light switch
operates normally, it indicates that a correct signal is
sent from the fog light switch.

STEP 2. Measure at fog light switch connector C-76 in
order to check the ground circuit to the fog light switch.
(1) Disconnect fog light switch connector C-76, and measure at
CONNECTOR: C-76
the wiring harness side.

(2) Measure the resistance value between terminal 7 and
ground.
CONNECTOR C-76 • The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.
