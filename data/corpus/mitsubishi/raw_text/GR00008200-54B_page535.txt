SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-535
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 2. Measure at driver’s seat belt switch connector D-
13 in order to check the ground circuit to the driver’s seat
belt switch.
(1) Disconnect driver’s seat belt switch connector D-13, and
CONNECTOR <ECLIPSE>: D-13
measure at the harness side.
