. • Engine speed is higher than 2,500 r/min.
CIRCUIT OPERATION
• The knock sensor sends a signal voltage to the Judgment Criteria
ECM (terminal 78) <M/T> or PCM (terminal 90) • Knock sensor output voltage (knock sensor peak
<A/T>. voltage in each 1/2 turn of the crankshaft) has not
changed more than 0.06 volt in the last consecu-
. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION tive 200 periods.
• The knock sensor converts the vibration of the
.
cylinder block into a voltage and outputs it. If TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely
there is a malfunction of the knock sensor, the causes for this code to be set are: )
voltage output will not change. • Knock sensor failed.
• The ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> checks whether • Open or shorted knock sensor circuit, or loose
the voltage output changes. connector.
• ECM <M/T> failed.
. DTC SET CONDITIONS • PCM <A/T> failed.
Check Conditions
• 2 seconds or more have passed since the start-
ing sequence was completed.
