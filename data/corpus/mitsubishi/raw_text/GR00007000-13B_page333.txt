MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-333
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 10. Check the power supply voltage at camshaft
position sensor connector B-22.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-22 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 6 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
B-22 HARNESS
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

STEP 11. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
MFI RELAY 18X terminal 4 and camshaft position sensor
connector B-22 terminal 6 because of open circuit or
short circuit to ground. Then go to Step 20.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 20.

STEP 12. Check the continuity at camshaft position sensor
connector B-22.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-22 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 7 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
