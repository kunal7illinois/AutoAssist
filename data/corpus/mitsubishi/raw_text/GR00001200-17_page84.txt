AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
Auto-cruise Vacuum Pump
1. Disconnect the vacuum hose from the auto-cruise vacuum
VACUUM pump and connect a vacuum gauge to the vacuum pump.
GAUGE
2. Disconnect the vacuum pump connector.
3. Check the auto-cruise vacuum pump and valves according
to the following procedure:
(1) Connect the positive battery terminal to auto-cruise
vacuum pump connector terminal 1, and the negative
battery terminal to terminals 2, 3, and 4.
Then the vacuum gauge should read 27 kPa (8.0 in Hg)
or more.
(2) The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.
Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 2 is disconnected from the negative
CONTROL RELEASE battery terminal while terminals 1, and 3 remain
VALVE VALVE
connected.
(3) The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.

Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 3 is disconnected from the negative
battery terminal while terminals 1, and 2 remain
connected.
