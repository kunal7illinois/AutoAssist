SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) 52B-83
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• Improper engaged connector or defective short • Damaged connector(s)
bar* • Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
• Short between the side air bag module (RH)
(squib) circuit terminals
NOTE: *: The squib circuit connectors integrate a "short" bar (which prevents the air bag from deploying unin-
tentionally due to static electricity by shorting the positive wire to the ground wire in the squib circuit when the
connectors are disconnected) (Refer to P.52B-3.) Therefore, if connector C-74 or D-19 is damaged or
improperly engaged, the short bar may not be released when the connector is connected.
