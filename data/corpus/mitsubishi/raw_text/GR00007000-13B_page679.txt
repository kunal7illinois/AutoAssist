M1131001800208
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
NOTE: The standard idling speed has been adjusted with the
speed adjusting screw (SAS), by the manufacturer. There
should be no need for readjustment.
NOTE: If the adjustment has been changed by mistake, the idle
speed may become too high or the idle speed may drop too low
when loads A/C, defogger, etc. are placed on the engine. If this
occurs, adjust by the following procedure.
NOTE: The adjustment, if made, should be made after first con-
firming that the spark plugs, the injectors, the idle air control
motor, compression, etc., are all normal.

inspection and adjustment.
• Engine coolant temperature: 80 − 95°C (176 − 203°F)
• Lights, electric cooling fan and accessories: OFF
• Transaxle: Neutral ("P" range on vehicle with A/T)

km (300 mile) or less], but no adjustment is necessary.
NOTE: If the engine stalls or the engine speed is low even
though the vehicle has been driven approximately 500 km
(300 mile) or more, it is probable that deposits are adhered
