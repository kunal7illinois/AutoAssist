board).
(1) Remove the combination meter. Refer to GROUP 54A,
Combination Meter Assembly and Vehicle Speed Sensor
P.54A-105.
(2) Remove the high-beam indicator light bulb. Then measure
the resistance value between the bulb terminals.
(3) Install the bulb to the combination meter, and then measure
CONNECTOR C-42
the resistance value between connector C-42 terminals 21
(COMBINATION METER SIDE)
and 22. The measured resistance value should be roughly
the same as the value measured in Step (2).
Q:Are these two resistance values extremely different?
YES : Repair or replace the combination meter (printed
circuit board).Check that the headlight-beam indicator
light illuminates normally.
NO (much the same) : Go to Step 5.
