ENGINE ELECTRICAL 16-47
IGNITION SYSTEM
ABNORMAL WAVEFORMS EXAMPLES
Example 1
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is high and short.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is too large.
AKX00280
Example 2
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is low and long, and is sloping. Also, the second
half of the spark line is distorted. This could be a result
of misfiring.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is too small.
AKX00281
Example 3
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is low and long, and is sloping. However, there is
almost no spark line distortion.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is fouled.
AKX00282
Example 4
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is high and short. Difficult to distinguish between
this and abnormal wave pattern example 1.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug cable is not properly connected. (Causing a dual
ignition)
