STEP 3. Check connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63
<3.0L Engine> at PCM for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE> YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PCM Connector Inspection P.00E-2.
C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>

STEP 4. Check the switch output voltage at PCM connector
C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63 <3.0L Engine> by backprobing.
("P" position)
(1) Do not disconnect connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63
CONNECTOR: C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
<3.0L Engine>.
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 101 and ground by
backprobing.
• When selector lever position is "P," voltage should be
battery positive voltage.
• When selector lever position is "R," voltage should be
0.5 volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "N," voltage should be
C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR 0.5 volt or less.
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE> • When selector lever position is "D," voltage should be
CONNECTOR HARNESS
0.5 volt or less.

• When selector lever position is "3," voltage should be
0.5 volt or less. <Vehicles without sport mode>
• When selector lever position is "2," voltage should be
0.5 volt or less. <Vehicles without sport mode>
• When selector lever position is "L," voltage should be
0.5 volt or less. <Vehicles without sport mode>
• When selector lever position is sport mode, voltage
should be 0.5 volt or less. <Vehicles with sport mode>
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Go to Step 5 <Vehicles with sport mode>. Repair
harness damage between the Park/Neutral position
switch connector B-41 terminal 3 and PCM connector
C-61 terminal 101 <Vehicles without sport mode>.
