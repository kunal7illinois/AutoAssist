13A-304 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check the output circuit voltage at intermediate
connector D-16.
(1) Remove the rear seat cushion. (Refer to GROUP 52, Rear
Seat P.52A-20.)
(2) Remove the protector.
(3) Disconnect intermediate connector D-16.
(4) Use special tools (MB991658 and MB991709) to connect
MB991709
terminals 5, 6 and 8 between connectors of the
MB991658
intermediate connector respectively.
(5) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(6) Remove the fuel cap.
(7) Measure the voltage between terminal 5 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 2.0 and 3.0 volts.
(8) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
AC002079AB YES : Remove the special tools and connect intermediate
connector D-16. Then go to Step 3 .
NO : Go to Step 6.
STEP 3. Check the output circuit voltage at ECM connector
C-57 <M/T> or PCM connector C-57 <A/T> by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the ECM connector C-56 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-57 <A/T>.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Remove the fuel cap.
(4) Measure the voltage between terminal 61 <M/T> or terminal
HARNESS SIDE 92 <A/T> and ground by backprobing.
CONNECTOR • Voltage should be between 2.0 and 3.0 volts.
<M/T> C-56 (5) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 21.
<A/T> C-57
NO : Go to Step 4.
