causes for this case:)
If the vehicle does not move forward or backward
• Abnormal line pressure
when the selector lever is shifted to any position
• Malfunction of the power train
while the engine is idling, the cause is probably
• Malfunction of the oil pump
abnormal line pressure, or a malfunction of the
• Malfunction of the valve body
power train, oil pump or valve body.
• Low A/T fluid level
• Malfunction of the PCM

DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check the hydraulic pressure.
Measure the hydraulic pressure of each element when the
transaxle is in 1st, 2nd or reverse. Check if each hydraulic
pressure is within the standard value. Refer to P.23A-26,
Hydraulic Pressure Test. If some elements are within the stan-
dard value and some are not, recheck the symptom.
Q:Are all pressures within the standard value?
YES : Check A/T fluid level and condition. If not OK, repair
or replace as necessary, then recheck symptom. If
OK, go to Step 3.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Disassemble and clean the valve body.
Check the O-ring installation bolts for looseness and valve
VALVE body for damage. Repair or replace the faulty parts. Refer to
BODY
GROUP 23B, Valve Body P.23B-74.
ASSEMBLY
Q:Is the repair possible and the symptom eliminated?
YES : Diagnosis is complete.
NO : Replace the valve body assembly. Then check the
symptom. If the symptom is not eliminated, go to Step
4.

STEP 3. Check the transaxle power train components.
Disassemble the transaxle and check the planetary carrier and
output shaft, etc. Repair or replace the damaged parts. Refer to
GROUP 23B, Transaxle P.23B-10, Planetary Gear P.23B-64,
Output Shaft P.23B-68, Differential P.23B-70. Then check the
PLANETARY GEAR
symptom.
Q:Is the symptom eliminated?
OUTPUT SHAFT
YES : Diagnosis is complete.
NO : Go to Step 5.
