DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check the voltage at generator connector B-45 by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector B-45.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground by
backprobing.
B-45 CONNECTOR
a. Engine: warming up
HARNESS SIDE VIEW
b. Radiator fan: stopped
1 2 3 4 c. Headlight switch: OFF to ON
d. Rear defogger switch: OFF to ON
e. Stoplight switch: OFF to On
• Voltage rises by 0.2 − 3.5 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
AK103519AB Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Go to Step 3.
STEP 2. Check connector B-45 at generator connector for
damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:B-45
YES : Replace the generator. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
