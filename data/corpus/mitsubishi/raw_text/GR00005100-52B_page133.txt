SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) 52B-133
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the ground circuit to the SRS-ECU.
(1) Disconnect SRS-ECU connector C-72, and measure at the
CONNECTOR: C-72
wiring harness side.
CAUTION
Do not insert a test probe into the terminal from its front
side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
weakened.

STEP 4. Check the power supply circuit to the SRS-ECU.
(1) Disconnect SRS-ECU connector C-72, and measure at the
CONNECTOR: C-72
wiring harness side.
(2) Connect the negative battery terminal.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
CAUTION
Do not insert a test probe into the terminal from its front
side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
SRS-ECU weakened.
