CIRCUIT OPERATION DTC SET CONDITIONS
• The PCM (terminal 124) applies 5 volts to the A/T If the A/T fluid temperature sensor output voltage is
fluid temperature sensor output terminal (terminal 4.5 volts or more after driving for 10 minutes or more
1). (if the A/T fluid temperature does not increase), there
• Ground terminal (terminal 2) is grounded to the is an open circuit in the A/T fluid temperature sensor
PCM (terminal 57). and diagnostic trouble code number "15" is output.
• The A/T fluid temperature sensor is an NTC (neg-
ative temperature coefficient) type of resistor. . TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely

tance decreases. • Malfunction of the A/T fluid temperature sensor
• The A/T fluid temperature sensor output voltage circuit
rises when the resistance increases (cools), and • Damaged harness, connector
drops when the resistance decreases (heats up). • Malfunction of the PCM
