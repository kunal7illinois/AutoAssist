POWER STEERING 37A-19
ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
OIL PUMP PRESSURE TEST
M1372002300122
Required Special Tools:
• MB990662: Pressure Gauge
PRESSURE SHUT-OFF VALVE • MB991548: Power Steering Oil Pressure Gauge Adapter
THERMO- GAUGE (FULLY CLOSED)
METER (MB990662) (Pump Side)
• MB991549: Power Steering Oil Pressure Gauge Adapter
(Hose Side)
RESERVOIR 1. Disconnect the pressure hose from the oil pump, and then
connect special tools MB991548, MB990662 and
ADAPTER
(MB991548) MB991549.
2. Bleed air, then turn the steering wheel several times while
the vehicle is not moving so that the temperature of the fluid
rises to approximately 50 − 60°C (122 − 140°F).
OIL 3. Start the engine and idle it at 1,000 ± 100 r/min.
PUMP
CAUTION
The pressure gauge shut-off valve must not remain closed
for more than 10 seconds.
ADAPTER
(MB991549) 4. Fully close the shut-off valve of the pressure gauge and
measure the oil pump relief pressure to confirm that it is
within the standard value range. Open it again immediately
after checking the pressure.
ACX01133AB
Standard value: 8.3 − 9.5 MPa (1,209 − 1,280 psi)
5. If it is not within the standard value, replace the oil pump.
6. Check whether or not the hydraulic pressure is the standard
value when no-load conditions are created by fully opening
the shut-off valve of the pressure gauge.
Standard value: 0.8 − 1.0 MPa (116 − 145 psi)
7. If it is not within the standard value, the probable cause is a
malfunction of the oil line or steering gear box, so check
these parts and repair as necessary.
8. Turn the steering wheel all the way to the left or right; then
check whether or not the retention hydraulic pressure is the
standard value.
Standard value: 8.3 − 9.5 MPa (1,209 − 1,280 psi)
9. If not the standard value, overhaul the steering gear box.
Remeasure fluid pressure.
10. Remove special tools MB991548, MB990662 and
MB991549, and then tighten the pressure hose to the
specified torque.
Tightening torque: 57 ± 7 N⋅m (42 ± 5 ft-lb)
11. Bleed the system.
