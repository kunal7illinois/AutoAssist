STEP 5. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector
MFI RELAY and injector connector because of open circuit or
short circuit to ground.
a. Repair harness wire between MFI relay
connector A-18X terminal 4 and injector
connector B-01 terminal 1 when checking No.
1 cylinder.
b. Repair harness wire between MFI relay
AK101363AB connector A-18X terminal 4 and injector
connector B-02 terminal 1 when checking No.
2 cylinder.
c. Repair harness wire between MFI relay
connector A-18X terminal 4 and injector
connector B-05 terminal 1 when checking No.
3 cylinder.
d. Repair harness wire between MFI relay
connector A-18X terminal 4 and injector
connector B-06 terminal 1 when checking No.
4 cylinder.
Then go to Step 10.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 10.

18X terminal 4 and injector connector B-05 terminal 1 when
checking No. 3 cylinder.
AK101363AB d. Check the harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
18X terminal 4 and injector connector B-06 terminal 1 when
CONNECTOR : B-01, B-02, B-05, B-06
checking No. 4 cylinder.
B-01 B-02 B-05B-06
