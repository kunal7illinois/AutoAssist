4. Connect the positive (+) terminal of a power supply
(approximately 6 volts) to terminal 2 and the terminal 5.
5. Connect the negative (−) terminal of the power supply to
each clip as described in the following steps. Then check
whether or not the stepper motor vibrates slightly as it
TERMINAL 2 operates.
IAC MOTOR (1) Connect the negative terminal of the power supply to
TERMINAL 5
terminal 1 and terminal 4.
(2) Connect the negative terminal of the power supply to
MB991709 AKX01627AB terminal 3 and terminal 4.
(3) Connect the negative terminal of the power supply to
terminal 3 and terminal 6.
(4) Connect the negative terminal of the power supply to
terminal 1 and terminal 6.
(5) Connect the negative terminal of the power supply to
terminal 1 and terminal 4.
(6) Repeat the tests in sequence from (5) to (1) to test
opposite movement of the IAC.
6. If vibration is detected during the test, the stepper motor can
be considered to be normal.
