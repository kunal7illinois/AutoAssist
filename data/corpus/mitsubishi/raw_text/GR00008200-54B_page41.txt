SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223: Test Harness Set
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
• MB991862: SWS Monitor Kit
STEP 1. Measure at ETACS-ECU connector C-119 in order
to check the battery power supply circuit to the ETACS-
ECU.
(1) Disconnect ETACS-ECU connector C-119, and measure at
CONNECTOR: C-119 the junction block side.
