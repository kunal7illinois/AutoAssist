MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-341
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3 Check the EGR solenoid.
(1) Disconnect the EGR solenoid connector B-31.
CONNECTOR: B-31 <WITHOUT VARIABLE
INDUCTION SYSTEM>
EGR
SOLENOID
VALVE
ACX02514AN
CONNECTOR: B-31 <WITH VARIABLE
INDUCTION SYSTEM>
EGR SOLENOID
VALVE
AC106190AD
(2) Measure the resistance between EGR solenoid side
connector terminal 1 and 2.
Standard value: 29 − 35 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
Q:Is the resistance at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the EGR solenoid. Then go to Step 12.
AKX00352
STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at EGR solenoid
harness side connector B-31.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-31 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
B-31 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR Q:Is the voltage normal?
2 1 YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Go to Step 5.
