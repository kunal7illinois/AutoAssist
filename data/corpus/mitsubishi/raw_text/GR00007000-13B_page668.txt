13B-668 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
CONTRAST WITH PROBABLE CAUSE
STANDARD WAVE
PATTERN
Induced electromotive force Malfunction of motor
does not appear or is
extremely small
Point B:
Height of coil back electromotive force
CONTRAST WITH PROBABLE CAUSE
STANDARD WAVE
PATTERN
Coil reverse electromotive Short in the coil
force does not appear or is
extremely small
.
Examples of Abnormal Wave Patterns
Example 1
• Cause of problem
Malfunction of motor. (Motor is not operating.)
• Wave pattern characteristics
Induced electromotive force from the motor turning does not
appear.

Example 2
OPEN • Cause of problem
CIRCUIT
Open circuit in the line between the idle air control motor
SIDE
and the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T>.
• Wave pattern characteristics
Current is not supplied to the motor coil on the open circuit
side. (Voltage does not drop to 0 volt.) Furthermore, the
induced electromotive force wave pattern at the normal side
NORMAL
SIDE is slightly different from the normal wave pattern.
