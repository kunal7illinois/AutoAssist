STEP 6. Check the combination meter (printed-circuit
board).
(1) Remove the combination meter.
(2) Remove the seat belt warning light bulb. Then measure the
resistance value between the bulb terminals.
(3) Install the bulb to the combination meter, and then measure
CONNECTOR C-41
the resistance value between connector C-41 terminal 52
(COMBINATION METER)
and connector C-42 terminal 27. The measured resistance
value should be roughly the same as the value measured in
Step (2).
Q:Are these two resistance values extremely different?
YES : Repair or replace the combination meter (printed
circuit board).Check that the seat belt warning light
illuminates normally.
NO (much the same) : Go to Step 7.
