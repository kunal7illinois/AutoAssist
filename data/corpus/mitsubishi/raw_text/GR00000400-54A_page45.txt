COMBINATION METERS ASSEMBLY AND VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR
STEP 6. Check the wiring harness between combination
meter connector C-41 (terminal 52) and ignition switch
(IG1).
NOTE: After checking junction block connectors C-111 and C-
CONNECTOR: C-41
108, check the wires. If junction block connectors C-111 and C-
108 are damaged, repair or replace the wiring harness. Refer
to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-2.

STEP 7. Check the combination meter (speedometer)
ground circuit at the combination meter connector C-42.
(1) Disconnect the combination meter connector C-42.
(2) Measure the resistance between terminal 34 and ground.
CONNECTOR C-42 • The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.

Q:Does the measured resistance value correspond with
this range?
YES : Repair or replace the combination meter (printed-
circuit board or speedometer and tachometer). The
speedometer should work normally.
NO : Go to Step 8.
