52B-36 SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS)
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS • Short circuit between the passenger’s (front) air
• Improper engaged connector or defective short bag module (squib) circuit terminals
bar* • Damaged connector(s)
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
NOTE: *: The squib circuit connectors integrate a "short" bar (which prevents the air bag from deploying unin-
tentionally due to static electricity by shorting the positive wire to the ground wire in the squib circuit when the
connectors are disconnected) (Refer to P.52B-20.) Therefore, if the connector C-11 or C-72 is damaged or
improperly engaged, the short bar may not be released when the connector is connected.
