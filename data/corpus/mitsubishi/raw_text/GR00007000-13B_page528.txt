13B-528 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the backup power supply voltage at ECM
harness side connector C-58 <M/T> or PCM harness side
connector C-55 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the ECM connector C-58 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-55 <A/T> and measure at the harness side.
(2) Measure the voltage between terminal 60 <M/T> or 66 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground.
C-58 HARNESS • Voltage should be battery positive voltage.

59 58 57565554535251504948 YES : Go to Step 4.
68 67 6665 646362 6160
NO : Check connectors C-07 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connector are in good condition,
AK000374AC repair harness wire between battery and ECM
connector C-58 <M/T> terminal 60 or PCM connector
<A/T> C-55 <A/T> terminal 66 because of open circuit or

STEP 4. Check connector C-58 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-55 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the harness connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-58<M/T>, C-55<A/T>
YES : Check connectors C-07 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T>
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connector are in good condition,
repair harness wire between battery and ECM
connector C-58 <M/T> terminal 60 or PCM connector
C-55 <A/T> terminal 66 because of harness damage.
Then go to Step 6.
C-55 C-58
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
AK000225AI
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 6.
