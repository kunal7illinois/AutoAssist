SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-443
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 4. Check the combination meter (printed-circuit
board).
(1) Remove the combination meter.
(2) Remove the theft-alarm indicator light bulb. Then measure
the resistance value between the bulb terminals.
(3) Install the bulb to the combination meter, and then measure
CONNECTOR C-42
the resistance value between connector C-42 terminals 31
(COMBINATION METER SIDE)
and 32. The measured resistance value should be roughly
the same as the value measured in Step (2).
Q:Are these two resistance values extremely different?
YES : Repair or replace the combination meter (printed
circuit board).Check that the seat belt warning light
illuminates normally.
NO (much the same) : Go to Step 5.

STEP 5. Check at combination meter connector C-42 in
order to check the battery power supply line to the theft-
alarm indicator light circuit.
(1) Disconnect combination meter connector C-42, and check
CONNECTOR: C-42
at the wiring harness side.

(2) Measure the voltage between terminal 32 and ground.
• The measured value should be approximately 12 volts
(battery positive voltage).
CONNECTOR: C-42
(HARNESS SIDE) Q:Does the measured voltage correspond with this range?
YES : Go to Step 8.
