STEP 1. Check the speedometer operation.
Q:Does the speedometer work normally?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Refer to Inspection Procedure 1 P.52A-8.
STEP 2. Check the engine coolant temperature sensor
signal circuit at the engine coolant temperature sensor
connector B-08 by back probing.
(1) Do not disconnect the engine coolant temperature sensor
connector B-08.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground by
CONNECTOR: B-08
(HARNESS SIDE) back probing.
• The measured value should be approximately 9 volts or
more.
Q:Does the measured voltage correspond with this range?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Go to Step 3.
