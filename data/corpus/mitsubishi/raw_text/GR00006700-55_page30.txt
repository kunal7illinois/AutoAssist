IDLE-UP OPERATION CHECK
M1552001600188
1. Before inspection and adjustment, set vehicle in the following
condition:
• Engine coolant temperature: 80 − 90 °C (176.0 - 194.0 °F)
• Lights, electric cooling fan and accessories: Set to OFF
• Transmission: Neutral ("N" or "P" for vehicles with A/T)
• Steering wheel: Straightforward
2. Check whether or not the idle speed is the standard value.
<2.4L Engine>: Refer to GROUP 13A, On-vehicle Service −
Basic Idle Speed Adjustment P.13A-577.
<3.0L Engine>: Refer to GROUP 13B, On-vehicle Service −
Basic Idle Speed Adjustment P.13B-679.
Standard value:
• <2.4L engine> 750 ± 100 r/min
• <3.0L engine> 700 ± 100 r/min
NOTE: . Check 4 minutes after idling begins.
3. When the A/C is running after turning the A/C switch to ON,
and the blower switch to the 3(MH) or 4(HI) position, check to
be sure that the idle speed is at the standard value.
Standard value: 850 ± 100 r/min
NOTE: . The engine control module <M/T>/the powertrain
control module <A/T> determines whether the A/C load is low
or high according to the output signal from the automatic
compressor controller.
NOTE: . It is not necessary to make an adjustment, because
the idling speed is automatically adjusted by the ISC system.
If, however, a deviation from the standard value occurs for
some reason, check the ISC system.
NOTE: . Check 4 minutes after idling begins.
