13A-586 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
2. While repeatedly revving the engine, measure the heated
oxygen sensor output voltage.
Standard value:
ENGINE HEATED OXYGEN REMARKS
SENSOR OUTPUT
VOLTAGE
When revving 0.6 − 1.0 V If you make the air/
engine fuel ratio rich by
revving the engine
repeatedly, a
normal heated
oxygen sensor will
output a voltage of
0.6 − 1.0 V.
3. If the sensor is defective, replace the heated oxygen sensor.
NOTE: For removal and installation of the heated oxygen sen-
sor, refer to GROUP 15, Exhaust Pipe and Main Muffler P.15-
21.

1. Using scan tool MB991502, observe HO S reading. If
2
HEATED OXYGEN SENSOR values are unsatisfactory, or if Scan tool is not available, use
EQUIPMENT SIDE CONNECTOR the following procedure:
(1) Disconnect the heated oxygen sensor connector and
connect special tool MB991658 to the connector on the
heated oxygen sensor side.
(2) Make sure that there is continuity [11 − 18 Ω at 20°C (68°
F)] between terminal 5 and terminal 6 on the heated
oxygen sensor connector
MB991658 (3) If there is no continuity, replace the heated oxygen
AK000121AB
sensor.
(4) Warm up the engine until engine coolant is 80° C (176°F)
JUMPER
WIRES or higher.
CAUTION
Be very careful when connecting the jumper wires; incor-
rect connection can damage the heated oxygen sensor.
(5) Use the jumper wires to connect terminal 5 of the heated
oxygen sensor connector to the positive battery terminal
and terminal 6 to the negative battery terminal.
MB991658 (6) Connect a digital voltage meter between terminal 3 and
AK000122AB
terminal 4.
2. While repeatedly revving the engine, measure the heated
oxygen sensor output voltage.
