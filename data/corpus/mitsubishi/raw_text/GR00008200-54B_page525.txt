SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-525
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
. • Malfunction of the ETACS-ECU
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• Malfunction of the key reminder switch • Damaged harness wires or connectors
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223: Test Harness Set
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Check the key reminder switch.
Disconnect key reminder switch connector C-88. Then check
CONNECTOR: C-88
continuity between terminals.
COLUMN SWITCH IGNITION KEY TESTER SPECIFIED
CONNECTION CONDITION
Removed 4 − 6 Less than 2 ohm
Inserted 4 − 6 Open circuit
Q:Is the key reminder switch in good condition?
AC106518AB YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Replace the key reminder switch. If the functions,
which are described in "CIRCUIT OPERATION", work
normally, the input signal from the key reminder
switch should be normal.
STEP 2. Measure at key reminder switch connector C-88 in
order to the ground circuit to the key reminder switch.
(1) Disconnect key reminder switch connector C-88, and
CONNECTOR: C-88
measure at the wiring harness side.

(2) Measure the resistance value between terminal 4 and
ground.
• The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.
