35A-36 BASIC BRAKE SYSTEM
FRONT DISC BRAKE ASSEMBLY
(2) Attach special tool MB990998 to the front hub assembly
as shown in the illustration, and tighten it to the specified
MB990998 torque.
Tightening torque: 226 ± 29 N⋅m (167 ± 21 ft-lb)

(3) Use a spring scale to measure the hub torque in the
forward direction. Record hub torque with pads removed.

CAUTION
Do not let any oil, grease or other contamination get onto
the friction surfaces of the pads and brake discs.
2. After re-installing the caliper support to the knuckle, install
the pad clips and the pads to the caliper support.
3. Clean the piston and insert into cylinder with special tool
MB990520.
4. Be careful that the piston boot does not become caught,
when lowering the caliper assembly and installing the guide
pin.
5. Check the brake drag force as follows.
MB990520
(1) Start the engine and hold the brake pedal down for 5
seconds. [Pedal depression force: approximately 196 N
(44 pound)]
AC002027AB (2) Stop the engine.
(3) Turn the brake disc forward 10 times.
(4) Use a spring scale to measure the hub torque with pads
installed in the same direction as earlier.
(5) Calculate the drag force of the disc brake [difference
between hub torque with pads installed and hub torque
with pads removed].
Standard value: 69 N (16 pounds) or less
6. If the brake drag force exceeds the standard value,
disassemble and clean the piston. Check for corrosion or
