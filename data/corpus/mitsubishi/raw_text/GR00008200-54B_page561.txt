SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-561
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 2. Check the door lock switch (power window main
switch).
Remove the power window main switch. Refer to GROUP 42,
CONNECTOR: E-12 Door − Door Trim and Waterproof Film P.42-54. Then check
FRONT DOOR (LH) continuity between the switch terminals.

OFF 3 − 9 − 10 Open circuit
UNLOCK 9 − 10 Less than 2 ohm
Q:Is the door lock switch (power window main switch) in
good condition?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the power window main switch. If the central
