4. EVAPORATIVE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM
(EXCEPT EVAPORATIVE EMISSION CANISTER)
(CHECK FOR LEAKS AND CLOGGING)
M1001001900216
If the fuel-vapor vent line is clogged or damaged, fuel vapor will
escape into the atmosphere causing excessive emissions. Dis-
connect the line at both ends, and blow it clean with com-
pressed air. Remove the fuel tank filler tube cap from the filler
tube and check to see if there is evidence that the seal makes
improper contact to the filler tube.
