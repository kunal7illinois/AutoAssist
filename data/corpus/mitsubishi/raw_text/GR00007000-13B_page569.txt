STEP 4. Check the engine idling.
Q:Is the idling good enough after warm up?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Refer to, INSPECTION PROCEDURE 8 − Unstable
Idle (Rough Idle, Hunting) P.13B-560.

(1) Check that the engine coolant temperature is 20°C (68°F)
CONNECTOR:B-34
or below.
NOTE: If necessary, you can disconnect the engine coolant
temperature sensor connector and connect the harness
side of the connector to another engine coolant temperature
sensor that is at 20°C (68°F) or below.
(2) Check the operation sound of the IAC motor can be heard
