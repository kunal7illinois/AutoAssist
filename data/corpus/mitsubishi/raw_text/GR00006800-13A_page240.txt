13A-240 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the sensor supply voltage at crankshaft
position sensor harness side connector B-20.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-20 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts.

STEP 7. Check the sensor supply voltage at ECM
connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM connector C-54 <A/T> by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the ECM connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-54 <A/T>.
(2) Disconnect the crankshaft position sensor connector B-20.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Measure the voltage between terminal 89 <M/T> or 45 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground by backprobing.
