1. Remove the brake drum and check the thickness of brake
shoe lining for wear. Check the automatic brake adjusting
system by hand to see if it operates smoothly. Also see if the
gears are in proper mesh with each other. To assure smooth
operation, apply a very thin coat of multipurpose grease to
the friction surface of the adjuster and link shaft.
CAUTION
The shoes for the right and left wheels should be replaced
at the same time. Never split or intermix brake shoe sets.
All four shoes must be replaced as a complete set.
2. Inspect the wheel cylinder boot for evidence of a brake fluid
leak. Visually check the boot for cuts, tears or heat cracks.
(A slight amount of fluid on the boot may not be a leak, but
may be preservative fluid used at assembly.) Check the
Brake Shoes for Wear.
