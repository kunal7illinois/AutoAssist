13.Check that the crimping amount (E) of the BJ boot band is at
the standard value and that the crimping amount (F) of the
BJ boot band is at the limited value.
Standard value (E): 2.4 − 2.8 mm (0.10 − 0.11 inch)
Limited value (F): 9.5 mm (0.40 inch)
<If the crimping amount is larger than 2.8 mm (0.11
inch)>
F Readjust the value of (W) in step 10 according to the
following formula, and then repeat the operation in
E ACX00997AC step 12.
[W = 5.8 mm (0.23 inch) − E]
Example: If E = 2.9 mm (0.11 inch), then W = 2.9 mm
(0.11 inch).
<If the crimping amount is smaller than 2.4 mm (0.09
inch)>
Remove the BJ boot band, readjust the value of (W) in
step 10 according to the following formula, and then
repeat the operations in steps 11 and 12 using a new
BJ boot band.
[W = 5.8 mm (0.23 inch) − E]
Example: If E = 2.3 mm (0.10 inch) then W = 3.5 mm
(0.15 inch).
14.Check that the BJ boot band is not sticking out past the
place where it has been installed. If the BJ boot band is
