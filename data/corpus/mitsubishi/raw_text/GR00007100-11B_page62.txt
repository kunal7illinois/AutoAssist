11B-62 ENGINE OVERHAUL <2.4L>
CRANKSHAFT AND CYLINDER BLOCK
BORING CYLINDER
1. Oversize pistons to be used should be determined on the
basis of the largest bore cylinder.

NOTE: Size mark is stamped on the piston top.
2. Measure the outside diameter (OD) of the piston to be used.
Measure it in thrust direction as shown.
3. Based on the measured piston OD, calculate the boring
finish dimension.
Boring finish dimension = Piston OD +
(clearance between piston OD and cylinder) −
0.02 mm (0.0008 inch) (honing margin)
CAUTION
To prevent distortion that may result from temperature rise
during honing, bore cylinders, working from number 2 to
number 4 to number 1 to number 3.
4. Bore all cylinders to the calculated boring finish dimension.
5. Hone to the final finish dimension (piston OD + clearance
between piston OD and cylinder).
6. Check the clearance between the piston and cylinder.
Clearance between piston and cylinder:
0.02 − 0.04 mm (0.0008 − 0.0015 inch)
NOTE: When boring cylinders, finish all of four cylinders to
the same oversize. Do not bore only one cylinder to an over-
size.
