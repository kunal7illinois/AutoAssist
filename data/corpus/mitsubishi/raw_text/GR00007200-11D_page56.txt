11D-56 ENGINE OVERHAUL <3.0L>
CRANKSHAFT AND CYLINDER BLOCK
Cylinder block height (when new):
210.5 mm (8.29 inches)
4. Check the cylinder walls for scratches and seizure. If defects
are evident, replace or bore to oversize and replace pistons
and piston rings.
12 mm (0.47 in) 5. Using a cylinder gauge, measure the cylinder bore and
CENTER cylindricity. If worn badly, correct by boring the cylinders to
an oversize and replace pistons and piston rings. Measure
BOTTOM
at the points shown in the illustration.
Standard value:
Cylinder Inside Diameter: 91.1 mm (3.59 inches)
AKX00739AB Cylindricity: 0.01 mm (0.0003 inch)
.
BORING CYLINDER
1. Oversize pistons to be used should be determined on the
basis of the largest bore cylinder.

AKX00740AB
NOTE: Size mark is stamped on the piston top.
2. Measure the outside diameter of the piston to be used.
Measure it in the thrust direction as shown.
3. Based on the measured piston Outside Diameter (OD),
calculate the boring finish dimension.
Boring finish dimension = Piston OD +
(clearance between piston OD and cylinder) −
0.02 mm (0.0008 inch) (honing margin)
CAUTION
To prevent distortion that may result from temperature rise
during honing, bore cylinders in the order of number 2,
number 4, number 6, number 1, number 3 and number 5.
4. Bore all cylinders to the calculated boring finish dimension.
5. Hone to the final finish dimension (piston OD + clearance
between piston OD and cylinder).
6. Check the clearance between the piston and cylinder.
Clearance between piston and cylinder:
0.02 − 0.04 mm (0.0008 − 0015 inch)
NOTE: When boring cylinders, finish all of six cylinders to
the same oversize. Do not bore only one cylinder to an over-
size.
