HOW TO DIAGNOSE
GENERAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEM CHECK
M1001005300045
A circuit consists of the power supply, switch, relay, load,
ground, etc. There are various methods to check a circuit
including an overall check, voltage check, short-circuit check,
and continuity check. Each of the methods briefly described
below apply only to circuits similar to the illustration.
1. VOLTAGE CHECK
POWER SUPPLY (1) Ground one lead wire of the test light. If a voltmeter is
used instead of the test light, ground the grounding side
lead wire.
FUSE
(2) Connect the other lead wire of the test light to the power
side terminal of the switch connector. The test light
should come on or the voltmeter should indicate a
ON (2)
voltage.
SWITCH
(3) Then, connect the test light or voltmeter to the motor
connector. The test light should not come on, or the
voltmeter should indicate no voltage. When the switch is
turned ON in this state, the test light should come on, or
OFF the voltmeter should indicate a voltage, with the motor
(3)
starting to run.
MOTOR (4) The circuit illustrated here is normal. If there is any
problem, such as the motor failing to run, check voltages
beginning at the connector nearest to the motor until the
TEST LIGHT
(OR faulty part is identified.
VOLTMETER)
(1) 2. SHORT-CIRCUIT CHECK
Because the fuse has blown, it is probable that there is a
ACX00956AB short circuit. Follow the procedures below to narrow down
the short-circuit location.
STEP 1. Remove the blown fuse and connect the test light
across the fuse terminals (Circuit switch: OFF).
Q:Does the test light illuminate?
YES : Short-circuit exists between the fuse block and the
POWER SUPPLY
switch. Repair the harness between the fuse block
and the switch.
FUSE BLOCK
NO : Go to Step 2.
