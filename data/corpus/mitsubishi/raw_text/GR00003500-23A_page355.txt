8. Measure the resistance between terminals 1 and 2 of each
solenoid valve.
Standard value: 2.7 − 3.4 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
9. If the resistance is not within the standard value, replace the
solenoid valve.
10.If within the standard value, check each wiring harness
between A/T control solenoid valve assembly and each
solenoid valve. If a problem is not found at the steps above,
check the solenoid valve O-rings and replace if necessary.
