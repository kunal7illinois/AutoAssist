MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-491
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the ignition timing.
Refer to GROUP 11A, On-vehicle Service − Ignition Timing
Check P.11A-6.
Q:Is the ignition timing normal?
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Check that the crankshaft position sensor and timing
belt cover are in the correct position. Then confirm
that the malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 6. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Check the following items in the data list. Refer to, Data List
Reference Table P.13A-544.
16 PIN a. Item 21: Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
b. Item 13: Intake Air Temperature Sensor.
MB991502
AKX01177AB c. Item 25: Barometric pressure Sensor.
d. Item 59: Heated Oxygen Sensor (rear).
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Repair or replace. Then confirm that the malfunction
symptom is eliminated.
STEP 7. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 11:
heated oxygen sensor (front).
(1) Start the engine and run at idle.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
11, Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
• Warm up the engine. When the engine is decelerated
suddenly from 4,000 r/min, the output voltage should
increase from 200 mV or less to 600 − 1,000 mV in a
few seconds.
16 PIN (3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
MB991502 Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
AKX01177AB YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Refer to,DTC P0130 − Heated Oxygen Sensor Circuit
(sensor 1) P.13A-126, DTC P0131 − Heated Oxygen
