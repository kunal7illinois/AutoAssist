MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-521
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the continuity at fuel pump relay 1 harness
side connector C-107.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-107 and measure at the
harness side.
AK103836
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 2 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
Q:Is the continuity normal?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Check harness connector C-101 at intermediate
connector for damage, and repair or replace as
required. Refer to, GROUP 00E, Harness Connector
Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate connectors are in
good condition, repair harness wire between fuel
pump relay 1 connector C-107 (terminal 2) and
ground because of open circuit. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 7. Check the power supply voltage at fuel pump relay
2 harness side connector C-105.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-105 and measure at the
harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Repair harness wire between fuel pump relay 1
connector C-107 (terminal 1) and fuel pump relay 2
connector C-105 (terminal 1) because of open circuit.
Then confirm that the malfunction symptom is
eliminated.
