5. If the purge flow volume is less than the standard value,
check it again with the vacuum hose disconnected from the
EVAP canister. If the purge flow volume is less than the
standard value, check the vacuum port and the vacuum
hose for clogging. Also check the evaporative emission
purge solenoid. If the purge flow volume is at the standard
value, replace the EVAP canister.

1. Remove the air intake hose <2.4L ENGINE>.
2. Disconnect the vacuum hose (black, black with red paint
mark) from the EVAP purge solenoid.
NOTE: When disconnecting the vacuum hose, always place
an identification mark so that it can be reconnected at its
original position.
3. Disconnect the harness connector.
4. Connect a hand vacuum pump to nipple (A) of the EVAP
purge solenoid (refer to the illustration at left).

5. As described in the chart below, check airtightness by
B applying a vacuum with voltage applied directly from the
battery to the EVAP purge solenoid valve and without
applying voltage.

6. Measure the resistance between the terminals of the EVAP
purge solenoid.
Standard value: 30 − 34 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
7. Replace solenoid if resistance is out of specification.
