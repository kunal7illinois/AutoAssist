13B-594 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Check the following items in the data list. Refer to, Data List
Reference Table P.13B-640.
16 PIN a. Item 21: Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
b. Item 13: Intake Air Temperature Sensor.
MB991502
AKX01177AB c. Item 25: Barometric pressure Sensor.
d. Item 69: Right Bank Heated Oxygen Sensor (rear).
e. Item 59: Left Bank Heated Oxygen Sensor (rear).
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Repair or replace. Then confirm that the malfunction
symptom is eliminated.
STEP 7. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 39:
Right Bank heated oxygen sensor (front).
(1) Start the engine and run at idle.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
39, Right Bank Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
• Warm up the engine. When the engine is decelerated
suddenly from 4,000 r/min, the output voltage should
increase from 200 mV or less to 600 − 1,000 mV in a
few seconds.
16 PIN (3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
