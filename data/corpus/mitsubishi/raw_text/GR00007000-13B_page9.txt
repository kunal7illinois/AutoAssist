NOTE: If the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator Lamp illuminates because of a malfunction of the
engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T>, communication between
scan tool MUT-II (MB991502) and the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> is impossible. In this case, the diagnostic
trouble code cannot be read.
NOTE: After the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> has detected a malfunction, the Service Engine Soon/Malfunc-
tion Indicator Lamp illuminates when the engine is next turned on and the same malfunction is re-detected.
However, for items marked with a "*" in the DTC NO. column, the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator
Lamp illuminates on the first detection of the malfunction.
NOTE: After the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator Lamp illuminates, it will be switched off under the
following conditions.
.
• When the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> monitored the power train malfunction three times* and met set
condition requirements, it detected no malfunction. *: In this case, "one time" indicates from engine start to
stop.
• For misfiring or a fuel trim malfunction, when driving conditions (engine speed, engine coolant tempera-
ture, etc.) are similar to those when the malfunction was first recorded.
NOTE: Sensor 1 indicates the sensor mounted at a position closest to the engine, and sensor 2 indicates the
sensor mounted at the position second closest to the engine.
NOTE: Bank 1 indicates the right bank side cylinder, and bank 2 indicates the left bank side cylinder.
