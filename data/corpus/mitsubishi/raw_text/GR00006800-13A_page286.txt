13A-286 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the evaporative emission purge solenoid.
(1) Disconnect the evaporative emission purge solenoid
CONNECTOR:B-33
connector B-33.
EVAPORATIVE
EMISSION PURGE
SOLENOID VALVE
ACX02513AJ
(2) Measure the resistance between evaporative emission
purge solenoid side connector terminal 1 and 2.
Standard value: 30 − 34 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
Q:Is the resistance at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the evaporative emission purge solenoid.
Then go to Step 12.
AKX00342
STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at evaporative
emission purge solenoid harness side connector B-33.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-33 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
B-33 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 6.
2 1 NO : Go to Step 5.
AKX01502AH
STEP 5. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
MFI RELAY 18X terminal 4 and evaporative emission purge
solenoid connector B-33 terminal 2 because of open
circuit or short circuit to ground. Then go to Step 12.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
