causes for this code to be set:)
If shift shock when driving are due to upshifting or
• Abnormal line pressure
downshifting and the transaxle speed become higher
• Malfunction of each solenoid valve
than the engine speed, the cause is probably abnor-
• Malfunction of the oil pump
mal line pressure or a malfunction of a solenoid
• Malfunction of the valve body
valve, oil pump, valve body or of a brake or clutch.
• Malfunction of each brake or each clutch
• Malfunction of the PCM

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
.
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, carry out the actuator
test.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to actuator test mode for following
items.
a. Item 01: Low-reverse solenoid valve
b. Item 02: Underdrive solenoid valve
c. Item 03: Second solenoid valve
16 PIN d. Item 04: Overdrive solenoid valve
• An operation sound should be heard from solenoid
MB991502
AC001252AB valve when solenoid valve is operated.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
