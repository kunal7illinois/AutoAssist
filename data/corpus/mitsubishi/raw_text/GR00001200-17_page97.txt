1. Remove the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve from
the rocker cover, then reconnect the PCV valve to the

vacuum supply hose.
2. With the engine idling, put your finger on the open end of the
PCV valve, and check for negative pressure (vacuum).
NOTE: At this time, the plunger in the PCV valve should
move back and forth as the open end is covered and uncov-
ered.
3. If negative pressure is not felt, clean or replace the PCV
AK100058AB valve. Inspect he vacuum supply hose and vacuum supply
hose port for restriction or plugged condition.
