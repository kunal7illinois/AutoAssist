13B-242 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 4. Check connector A-18X at the MFI relay for
damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
MFI RELAY 18X terminal 4 and left bank heated oxygen sensor
(rear) connector B-23 terminal 1 because of open
circuit or short circuit to ground. Then go to Step 12.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.

STEP 5. Check the power supply voltage at ECM connector
C-51 <M/T> or PCM connector C-52 <A/T> by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector C-51 <M/T> or C-52 <A/
T>.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T> (3) Measure the voltage between terminal 26 and ground by
CONNECTOR HARNESS backprobing.
