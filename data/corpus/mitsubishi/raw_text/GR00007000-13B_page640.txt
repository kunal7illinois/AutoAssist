13B-640 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the circuit at ECM connector C-62 <M/T> or
PCM connector C-59.
(1) Disconnect the connectors C-62 <M/T> or C-59 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 83 and ground.
<M/T>
• Voltage should be 1 volt or less when the A/C switch is
C-62 HARNESS "OFF".
SIDE CONNECTOR • Voltage should be battery positive voltage when the A/C
77 76 75 7473 7271 switch is "ON".

(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
NO : Refer to GROUP 55, Diagnosis − Introduction To

CAUTION
• When shifting the select lever to D range, the brakes should be applied so that the vehicle does
not move forward.
• Driving tests always need two persons: one driver and one observer.
NOTE: Sensor 1 indicates the sensor mounted at a position closest to the engine, and sensor 2 indicates the
sensor mounted at the position second close to the engine.
NOTE: Bank 1 indicates the right bank cylinder, and bank 2 indicates the left bank cylinder.
NOTE: *1: If the idle speed is lower than the standard value on a very cold engine [approximately -20°C (-
4°F)] even when the IAC motor is fully opened, the air volume limiter built in the throttle body could be defec-
tive.
NOTE: *2: In a new vehicle [driven approximately 500 km (311 mile) or less], the step of the stepper motor is
sometimes 30 steps greater than the standard value.
NOTE: *3: The injector drive time represents the time when the cranking speed is at 250 r/min or below when
the power supply voltage is 11 volts.
NOTE: *4: In a new vehicle [driven approximately 500 km (311 mile) or less], the injector drive time is some-
times 10% longer than the standard time.
NOTE: *5: In a new vehicle [driven approximately 500 km (311 mile) or less], the volume air flow sensor out-
put frequency is sometimes 10% higher than the standard frequency.
NOTE: *6: Applicable to GST
