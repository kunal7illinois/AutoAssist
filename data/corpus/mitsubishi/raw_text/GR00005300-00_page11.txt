HOW TO USE TROUBLESHOOTING/INSPECTION SERVICE POINTS
• From back side of the connector (SRS-ECU harness side
connector)
MB991219
ACX00865AB
Since the SRS-ECU harness connector is plated to
SRS-ECU HARNESS
improve conductivity, observe the warning below when
CONNECTOR
checking this connector.
WARNING
Insert the backprobing tool into the connector from
the harness side, and connect the tester to the back-
probing tool. If any tool other than the backprobing
tool is used, it may cause damage to the harness and
other components. Furthermore, measurement
AC001607AB
should not be carried out by touching the backprob-
ing tool directly against the terminals from the front
of the connector. The terminals are plated to increase
their conductivity, so that if they are touched directly
by the backprobing tool, the plating may break, which
will decrease reliability.
<When Inspecting a Male Pin>
CAUTION
At this time, be careful not to short the connector pins with
the test probes. To do so may damage the circuits inside
the ECU.
Touch the pin directly with the test probe.
