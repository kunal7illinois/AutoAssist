MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-249
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 8. Check the right bank injector resistance at
intermediate connector B-48.
(1) Disconnect the injector intermediate connector B-48.
CONNECTOR:B-48
AK000209AC
(2) Measure the resistance between each male connector side
INJECTOR connector terminal.
INTERMEDIATE
CONNECTOR a. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 2 when
measuring No. 1 cylinder.
b. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 3 when
1 2 measuring No. 3 cylinder.
3 4 c. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 4 when
measuring No. 5 cylinder.
• Resistance should be between 13 and 16 ohm [at 20°C
(68°F)].

Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 11.
NO : Go to Step 9.
STEP 9. Check connector B-01, B-05, B-26 at right bank
injector for damage.
(1) Remove the intake manifold.
CONNECTORS : B-01, B-05, B-26
(2) Check the injector connector, which deviates from the
standard value at Step 8.
B-05 B-26 Q:Is the connector in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 10.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 16.
