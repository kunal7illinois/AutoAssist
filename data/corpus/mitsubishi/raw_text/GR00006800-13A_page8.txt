13A-8 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
DTC NO. ITEMS
P0768 Shift solenoid "D" electrical
P1400 Manifold differential pressure sensor circuit malfunction
P1603* Battery backup circuit malfunction
P1751 A/T control relay malfunction
NOTE: If the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator Lamp illuminates because of a malfunction of the
engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T>, transmission between scan
tool MUT-II (MB991502) and the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> is impossible. In this case, the diagnostic trouble
code (DTC) cannot be read.
NOTE: After the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> has detected a malfunction, the Service Engine Soon/Malfunc-
tion Indicator Lamp illuminates when the engine is next turned on and the same malfunction is re-detected.
However, for items marked with a "*" in the DTC NO column, the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator
Lamp illuminates on the first detection of the malfunction.
NOTE: After the Service Engine Soon/Malfunction Indicator Lamp illuminates, it will be switched off under the
following conditions.
.
• When the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> monitored the power train malfunction three times* it met set condi-
tion requirements, it detected no malfunction. *: In this case, "one time" indicates from engine start to stop.
• For misfiring or a fuel trim malfunction, when driving conditions (engine speed, engine coolant tempera-
ture, etc.) are similar to those when the malfunction was first recorded.
NOTE: Sensor 1 indicates the sensor mounted at a position closest to the engine, and sensor 2 indicates the
sensor mounted at the position second closest to the engine.
HOW TO READ AND ERASE DIAGNOSTIC
TROUBLE CODE
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
NOTE: If Battery positive voltage is low, diagnostic trouble
codes may not be output. Be sure to check the battery and
charging system before continuing.
NOTE: If battery cable is disconnected or if the engine control
module (ECM) connector <M/T> or powertrain control module
(PCM) connector <A/T> is disconnected, the diagnostic trouble
codes will be erased. Do not disconnect the battery cable or
ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> connector until the diagnostic trou-
ble codes have been recorded.
NOTE: If a DTC is erased, its "freeze frame" data will be also
erased and the readiness test status will be reset. If necessary,
store the "freeze frame" data before erasing the DTC.
