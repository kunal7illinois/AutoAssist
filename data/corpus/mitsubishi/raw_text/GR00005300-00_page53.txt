CHECKING A/T FLUID LEVEL
1. Drive the vehicle until the A/T fluid temperature rises to the
FLUID LEVEL [mm (in)]
normal temperature [70 − 80°C (158 − 176°F)].
10 (0.4)
NOTE: The A/T fluid temperature is measured with MUT-II.
0 (0)
NOTE: If it takes some amount of time until the A/T fluid
– 10 (– 0.4) reaches its normal operating temperature [70 − 80°C (158 −
176°F)], check the A/T fluid level by referring to the left dia-
– 20 (– 0.8)
gram.

converter and the hydraulic circuits with A/T fluid, and then
move the selector lever to the "N" position.
4. After wiping off any dirt around the dipstick, remove the
dipstick and check the condition of the A/T fluid.
NOTE: If the fluid smells as if it is burnt, it means that the A/
T fluid has been contaminated by fine particles from the
bushings and friction materials, A transaxle overhaul and
cooler line flushing may be necessary.
