DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 22:
Crankshaft Position Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
22, Crankshaft Position Sensor.
16 PIN (4) Check the waveform of the crankshaft position sensor while
keeping the engine speed constant.

(5) Turn the ignition switch to "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Refer to DTC P0335 − Crankshaft Position Sensor
Circuit Malfunction P.13B-315.
