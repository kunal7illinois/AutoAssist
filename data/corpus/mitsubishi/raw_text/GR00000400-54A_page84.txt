STEP 13. Check the spark plugs.
CAUTION
Do not attempt to adjust the gap of the platinum plug.
Cleaning of the platinum plug may result in damage to the
platinum tips. Therefore, if carbon deposits must be
removed, use a plug cleaner and complete cleaning within
20 seconds to protect the electrode. Do not use a wire
brush.
(1) Check the plug gap and replace if the limit is exceeded.
PLATINUM
TIPS Standard value: 1.0 − 1.1 mm (0.039 − 0.043 inch)
Limit: 1.3 mm (0.051 inch)
AAKKXX0000338833AB Q:Is the plug gap at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 14.
NO : Replace the faulty spark plug. Then go to Step 1.
STEP 14. Check the spark plug cable.
(1) Check the cap and coating for cracks.
(2) Measure the resistance.
Limit: maximum 22 kΩ
Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Refer to GROUP 13A <2.4L>, MFI − MFI Diagnosis
P.13A-535 or GROUP 13B <3.0L>, MFI − MFI
Diagnosis P.13B-633.
NO : Replace the faulty spark plug cable. Then go to Step
1.
AKX00382
STEP 15. Check the injector.
(1) Disconnect the injector connector.
(2) Measure the resistance between each injector side
INJECTOR SIDE connector terminal 1 and 2.
CONNECTOR • The measured value should be between approximately
13 and 16 ohm [at20°C (68°F)].
1 2
Q:Does the measured voltage correspond with this range?
YES : Go to Step 16.
NO : Replace the faulty injector. Then go to Step 1.
AK000241AB
STEP 16. Check connector at injector for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
YES : • Go to Step 17 <2.4L engine>.
• Go to Step 20 <3.0L engine>.
NO : Repair or replace the faulty injector. Refer to GROUP
00E, Harness Connector Inspection (P.00E-2). Then
go to Step 1.
