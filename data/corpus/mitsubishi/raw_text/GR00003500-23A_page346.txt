A/T FLUID CHECK

1. Drive the vehicle until the A/T fluid temperature rises to the
normal temperature [70 − 80°C (158 − 176°F)].
NOTE: The A/T fluid temperature is measured with scan tool
(MUT-II).
NOTE: If it takes some amount of time until the A/T fluid
FLUID LEVEL [mm (in)]
reaches its normal operating temperature [70 − 80°C (158 −
10 (0.4)
176°F)], check the A/T fluid level by referring to the left dia-
0 (0) gram.

FLUID TEMPERATURE [˚C (˚F)] AC002477AB
dipstick and check the condition of the A/T fluid.
NOTE: If the A/T fluid smells as if it is burnt, it means that
the A/T fluid has been contaminated by fine particles from
the bushings and friction materials. A transaxle overhaul and
cooler line flushing may be necessary.
5. Check that the A/T fluid level is at the "HOT" mark on the
dipstick. If the A/T fluid level is lower than this, pour in more
DIAMOND ATF SP III or equivalent until the level reaches
the "HOT" mark.
