SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) 52B-53
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
CIRCUIT OPERATION DTC SET CONDITIONS
• The SRS-ECU is powered from the ignition • This DTC is set if the voltage between the IG1
switch (IG1). terminals (fuse No.22 circuit) and ground is lower
• The SRS-ECU power is supplied from two cir- than a predetermined value for a continuous
cuits. Even if one circuit is shut off, the air bag period of five second or more. However, if the
can inflate. vehicle condition returns to normal, DTC num-
bers 42 will be automatically erased, and the
SRS warning light will switch off.
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• Damaged wiring harnesses or connectors
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-ll)
• MB991223 (MB991222): Harness set (Probe)
STEP 1. Check junction block multi-purpose fuse number
22.
Q:Is the fuse burned out?
NO : Go to Step 2.
YES : Go to Step 4.
STEP 2. Check the harness for open circuit between the
SRS-ECU and the ignition switch (IG1).
Measurement at SRS-ECU connector C-72.
CONNECTOR: C-72
(1) Disconnect SRS-ECU connector C-72.
(2) Connect the negative battery terminal.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
CAUTION
Do not insert a test probe into the terminal from its front
side directly as the connector contact pressure may be
SRS-ECU weakened.
ACCELERATOR PEDAL (4) Measure at the wiring harness side.
CENTER REINFORCEMENT(LH)AC000358AD (5) Measure the voltage between terminal 9 and body ground
• Voltage should be 9 volts or more.
C-72 CONNECTOR
(HARNESS SIDE) REAR VIEW Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Erase the DTC memory, and recheck if any DTC sets.

If DTC 42 sets, replace the SRS-ECU. Refer to
9 10111213141516
P.52B-142. Then go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 3.
