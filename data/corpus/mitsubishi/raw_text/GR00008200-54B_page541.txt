SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-541
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 2. Malfunction of the driver’s door lock key cylinder
switch
Disconnect driver’s door lock key cylinder switch connector E-
CONNECTOR: E-14 14.Then check continuity between the switch terminals.

SWITCH POSITION TESTER SPECIFIED
CONNECTION CONDITION
LOCK 2 − 3 Less than 2 ohm
Neutral (OFF) 1 - 2 - 3 Open circuit
UNLOCK 1 − 2 Less than 2 ohm
Q:Is the driver’s door lock key cylinder switch in good
condition?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the driver’s door lock key cylinder switch. If
the systems, which are described in "CIRCUIT
OPERATION", work normally, the input signal from
the driver’s door lock key cylinder switch should be
normal.
