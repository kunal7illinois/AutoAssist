13A-60 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check the sensor output voltage at barometric
pressure sensor connector B-14 by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector B-14.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground by
backprobing.
• When altitude is 0 m (0 foot), voltage should be 3.7 and
4.3 volts.
B-14 CONNECTOR • When altitude is 600 m (1,969 feet), voltage should be
HARNESS 3.4 and 4.0 volts.
SIDE VIEW • When altitude is 1,200 m (3,937 feet), voltage should be
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 3.2 and 3.8 volts.
• When altitude is 1,800 m (5,906 feet), voltage should be
2.9 and 3.5 volts.

(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Go to Step 5.
STEP 3. Check connector B-14 at the barometric pressure
sensor and connector C-60 at ECM <M/T> or connector C-
54 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-14
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
