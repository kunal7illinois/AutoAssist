RESISTANCE CHECK
CAUTION
When inserting a testing probe into the power supply ter-
minal, be careful not to touch the printed board.
POWER SUPPLY
1. Remove the power supply tightening screw.
2. Use an ohmmeter to measure resistance value between the
terminals.
Standard value:
GROUND
• Power supply − Ground: Approximately 176 ohms
• Power supply − Engine coolant temperature gauge:
ENGINE COOLANT
TEMPERATURE GAUGE Approximately 54 ohms
AC001298AB • Engine coolant temperature gauge − Ground:
Approximately 230 ohms
3. If within the standard value, the engine coolant temperature
gauge is OK.
4. If not within the standard value, replace the fuel gauge and
engine coolant temperature gauge.
