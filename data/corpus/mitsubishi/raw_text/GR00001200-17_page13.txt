DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991223: Harness Set
STEP 1. Check the output circuit voltage at auto-cruise
control-ECU connector C-20 (terminal numbers 7,8 and 16)
by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position and the auto-
cruise control main switch to the "ON" position.
. (3) Measure the voltage between terminal 7 and ground by

(5) Measure the voltage between terminal 16 and ground by
backprobing.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(When the motor is stopped during a constant road
speed.)
(6) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Are all of the above values satisfied?
YES : Check that diagnostic trouble code 11 is not output.
If diagnostic trouble code 11 is output, replace the
auto-cruise control-ECU. (Refer to P.17-86.)
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 11 is not.
NO : Go to Step 2.
