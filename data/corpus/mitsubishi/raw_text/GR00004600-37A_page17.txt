STEERING WHEEL RETURN TO CENTER CHECK
M1372001800124
Conduct a road test:
1. Make both gradual and sudden turns and check the steering
wheel return.
2. At a speed of approximately 35 km/h (22 mph), turn the
steering wheel 90 degrees, hold a few seconds, then
release. If the steering wheel then returns 70 degrees or
more, the return can be judged satisfactory.
70˚ 70˚ NOTE: There will be a momentary feeling or "heaviness"
when the wheel is turned quickly, but this is not abnormal.
(Oil pump discharge amount is especially apt to be insuffi-
cient during idling.)
