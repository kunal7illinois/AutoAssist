MODE 6 REFERENCE TABLE
The engine powertrain control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T> monitors the
condition of emission control system.
By selecting MODE 6 using scan tool, Test Result and Limit Value (minimum) *1 or (maximum) *2 about the
main items of emission control system which ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> monitors can be confirmed. The
value at the last monitoring is output by ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> as a test result.

GENERAL SCAN
TOOL
01 Catalyst ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> Catalyst Frequency × 0.0039
monitor (Bank monitors the deterioration of Ratio Bank 1
1) catalyst at right bank side by the Test Result and Limit
output frequency ratio between Value (max.)
right bank heated oxygen sensor
(front) and right bank heated
oxygen sensor (rear).
02 Catalyst ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> Catalyst Frequency × 0.0039
monitor (Bank monitors the deterioration of Ratio Bank 2
2) catalyst at left bank side by the Test Result and Limit
output frequency ratio between left Value (max.)
bank heated oxygen sensor (front)
and left bank heated oxygen sensor
(rear).
03 EGR monitor ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EGR Monitor Pressure × 0.43 kPa
monitors the operation of EGR Value
system by the pressure difference Test Result and Limit
of intake manifold between before Value (min.) kPa
and after introduction of EGR using
the manifold differential pressure
sensor.
06 Evaporation ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EVAP Leak Mon. 1mm × 0.032 kPa
leak monitor monitors the leak of fuel Pressure Value
(Small leak) evaporation gas by the reduction of Test Result and Limit
vacuum in tank after appointed time Value (max.) kPa
using the fuel tank differential
pressure sensor after making the
fuel tank and the fuel line vacuum.
