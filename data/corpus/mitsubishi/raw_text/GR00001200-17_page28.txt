17-28 ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL
AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
STEP 8. Check the output circuit voltage at auto-cruise
control-ECU connector C-20 (terminal numbers 7,8 and 16)
by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position and the auto-
cruise control main switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 7 and ground by
C-20 CONNECTOR
backprobing.

• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
[When decelerating with the "SET" switch while driving
at constant speed (Release valve open).]

(5) Measure the voltage between terminal 16 and ground by
backprobing.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(When the motor is stopped during a constant road
speed.)
(6) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Are all of the above values satisfied?
YES : Check that diagnostic trouble code 14 is not output.
If diagnostic trouble code 14 is output, replace the
auto-cruise control-ECU. (Refer to P.17-86.)
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 14 is not.
NO : Go to Step 9.
STEP 9. Check auto-cruise control-ECU connector C-20
and intermediate connector C-94.
Q:Is the connector damaged?
CONNECTOR: C-20
YES : Repair or replace connector.
Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection
P.00E-2.
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 14 is not
output.
NO : Go to Step 10.
