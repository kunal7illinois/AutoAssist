17-108 ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL
EMISSION CONTROL
4. As described in the chart below, apply a vacuum and check
the passage of air by blowing through one side of the EGR
passage.
VACUUM PASSAGE OF AIR
5.3 kPa (1.6 in Hg) or less Air is not blown out
29 kPa (8.7 in Hg) or more Air is blown out
NOTE: Passage of air should be checked by blowing the
valve port.
5. Reinstall the EGR valve, using a new gasket, and tighten to
the specified torque.
Tightening torque:
<2.4L ENGINE> 19 ± 3 N⋅m (14 ± 2 ft-lb)
<3.0L ENGINE> 22 ± 4 N⋅m (16 ± 3 ft-lb)

2. Start the engine.
1.0 SECOND 3. Measure engine vacuum at idle.
Standard value: 51 kPa (15 in Hg) or more
VACUUM 4. Reset the vacuum pump to "0" (Release vacuum).
5. Using a stop watch, measure how long it takes for the
vacuum gauge to reach 51 kPa (15 in Hg).
Standard value: 1.0 second or less
6. If it takes more than 1.0 second for the gauge to reach 51
RESET TIME
AKX00350AB kPa (15 in Hg), the EGR may be restricted and should be
cleaned.
