AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the sensor output voltage at PCM
connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63 <3.0L Engine> by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63
CONNECTOR: C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
<3.0L Engine>.
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 124 and ground by
C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
backprobing.
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>
• When A/T fluid temperature is 20°C (68°F), voltage
CONNECTOR HARNESS
SIDE VIEW should be between 3.8 and 4.0 volts.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 40°C (104°F), voltage
should be between 3.2 and 3.4 volts.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 80°C (176°F), voltage
should be between 1.7 and 1.9 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
AC001792AD Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Go to Step 7.
STEP 6. Check connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63
<3.0L Engine> at PCM for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
