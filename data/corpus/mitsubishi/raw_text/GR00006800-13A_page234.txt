13A-234 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 4. Check for open circuit and short circuit to ground
and harness damage between knock sensor connector B-
35 (terminal 1) and ECM connector C-60 (terminal 78) <M/
T> or PCM connector C-57 (terminal 90) <A/T>.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
CONNECTOR: B-35
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Repair it. Then go to Step 6.

STEP 5. Check the knock sensor.
(1) Disconnect the knock sensor connector B-35.
KNOCK SENSOR (2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Measure the voltage between knock sensor side connector
terminal 1 (output) and 2 (ground).
(4) Gradually increase the engine speed.
• The voltage increases with the increase in the engine
speed.
(5) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK"(OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
ACX02470AG YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 6.
NO : Replace the knock sensor. Then go to Step 6.
CONNECTOR: B-35
