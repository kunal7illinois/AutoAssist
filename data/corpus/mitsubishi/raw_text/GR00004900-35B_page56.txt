WHEEL SPEED SENSOR
INSTALLATION SERVICE POINT
.>>A<< FRONT SPEED SENSOR/REAR SPEED SENSOR
INSTALLATION
The clearance between the wheel speed sensor and the ABS
FRONT REAR
rotor’s toothed surface is not adjustable, but measure the dis-
tance between the sensor installation surface and the ABS
rotor’s toothed surface.
Standard value: 28.2 − 28.5 mm (1.11 − 1.12 inches)

SPEED SENSOR CHECK
1. Check whether any metallic foreign material has adhered to
the projection at the speed sensor tip. Remove any foreign
material. Also check whether the pole piece is damaged.
Replace it with a new one if it is damaged.
NOTE: The projection can become magnetized due to the
magnet inside the speed sensor, causing foreign material to
easily adhere to it. The projection may not be able to cor-
rectly sense the wheel rotation speed if foreign matter is on
PROJECTION it or if it is damaged.

2. Measure the resistance between the speed sensor
<FRONT, <REAR RIGHT> terminals.
REAR LEFT>
Standard value: 1.28 − 1.92 kΩ
3. If the internal resistance of the speed sensor is not within the
standard value, replace it with a new speed sensor.

4. Remove all connections from the speed sensor. The circuit
should be open between terminals (1) and (2) and the body
of the speed sensor. If the circuit is not open, replace with a
new speed sensor.
5. Check the speed sensor cable for breakage, damage or
disconnection. Replace with a new one if a problem is found.
NOTE: When checking for cable damage, remove the cable
clamp part from the body and then gently bend and pull the
<FRONT,
<REAR RIGHT> cable near the clamp.
