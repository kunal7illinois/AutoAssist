TCL warning light by turning the transistor in the
ECU "ON" and "OFF." .
• The ABS-ECU illuminates the TCL warning light TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely
for three seconds on start-up <ignition key: "ON" causes for this case:)
(with engine stopped)>. When the ABS-ECU • Damaged wiring harness or connector
completes the self-check, it turns off the light. • Malfunction of the hydraulic unit (integrated with
ABS-ECU)
.
