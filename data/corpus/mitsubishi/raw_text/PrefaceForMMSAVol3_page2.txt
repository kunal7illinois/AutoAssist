WARNING
Proper service methods and repair procedures are necessary for the safe,
reliable operation of all motor vehicles as well as the personal safety of the
person doing the repair. There are many types of procedures, techniques,
tools, and parts for servicing vehicles, as well as differences in the skills of
the people doing the work. This manual cannot give advice or precautions for
every possible situation. Because of this, anyone who does not follow the
instructions in this manual must first make sure that the choice of methods,
tools, or parts will not cause damage to the vehicle or injury to the person
doing the work. The following list contains general precautions that should
always be followed while working on a vehicle.
• Always wear safety glasses for eye protection.
• Use safety stands whenever a procedure requires work under the
vehicle.
• Be sure the ignition switch is always "off" unless otherwise specified by
a procedure.
• Set the parking brake when working on a vehicle.
• Operate the engine only in a well-ventilated area.
• Keep clear of moving parts when the engine is running.
• To prevent serious burns, avoid contact with hot metal parts such as the
radiator, exhaust manifold, tail pipe, catalytic converter and muffler.
• Do not smoke while working on or near a vehicle.
