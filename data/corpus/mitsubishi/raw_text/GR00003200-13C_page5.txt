FUEL SUPPLY 13C-5
FUEL SUPPLY DIAGNOSIS
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(4) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(5) Use the Actuator test 07 to drive the fuel pump. Check that
there is no fuel leaking from any section when the fuel
pump is operating.
16 PIN (6) Stop the fuel pump.
(7) Start the engine and run at idle.
MB991502 (8) Measure fuel pressure while the engine is running at idle.
AC000077AB
Standard value: Approximately 270 kPa (38 psi) at
curb idle
(9) Disconnect the vacuum hose from the fuel pressure
<2.4L>
regulator and measure fuel pressure with the hose end
closed with your finger.
Standard value: 330 − 350 kPa (47 − 50 psi) at curb
idle
(10)Check to see that fuel pressure at idle does not drop even
after the engine has been revved several times.
(11)Revving the engine repeatedly, hold the fuel return hose
lightly with your fingers to feel that fuel pressure is present
AC106099AB in the return hose.
NOTE: If the fuel flow rate is low, there will be no fuel pres-
<3.0L>
sure in the return hose.
(12)If any of fuel pressure measured in steps 10 to 13 is out of
specification, troubleshoot and repair according to the table
below.
AC106100AB
SYMPTOM PROBABLE CAUSE REMEDY
• Fuel pressure too low Clogged fuel filter Replace fuel filter
• Fuel pressure drops after racing
Fuel leaking to return side due to Replace fuel pressure regulator
• No fuel pressure in fuel return
poor fuel regulator valve seating or
hose
settled spring
Low fuel pump delivery pressure Replace fuel pump
Fuel pressure too high Binding valve in fuel pressure Replace fuel pressure regulator
regulator
Clogged fuel return hose or pipe Clean or replace hose or pipe
Same fuel pressure when vacuum Damaged vacuum hose or Replace vacuum hose or clean
hose is connected and when clogged nipple nipple
disconnected
Defective fuel pressure regulator Replace fuel pressure regulator
