MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-507
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the voltage at generator harness side
connector B-45.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-45 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 4 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
B-45 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
4 3 2 1
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 6.

STEP 6. Check connector C-58 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-55 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-58<M/T>, C-55<A/T>
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T>
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 10.

STEP 7. Check for open circuit and short circuit to ground
between generator connector B-45 terminal 4 and ECM
connector C-58 terminal 52 <M/T> or PCM connector C-55
terminal 54 <A/T>.
NOTE: Check harness after checking intermediate connector
B-13. If intermediate connector is damaged, repair or replace
them. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection
P.00E-2. Then go to Step 10.
