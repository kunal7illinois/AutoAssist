SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 2. Check the driver’s door lock actuator switch.
Disconnect driver’s door lock actuator switch connector E-13.
CONNECTOR: E-13 Then check continuity between the switch terminals.

Q:Is the driver’s door lock actuator switch in good
condition?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the driver’s door lock actuator switch. If the
LOCK functions, which are described in "CIRCUIT
VIEW A UNLOCK OPERATION", work normally, the input signal from
the driver’s door lock actuator switch should be
normal.

STEP 3. Measure at driver’s door lock actuator switch
connector E-13 in order to check the ground circuit to the
driver’s door lock actuator switch.
(1) Disconnect driver’s door lock actuator switch connector E-
CONNECTOR: E-13 13, and measure at the harness side.

(2) Measure the resistance value between terminal 1 and
ground.
• The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.
Q:Does the measured resistance value correspond with
CONNECTOR E-13
this range?
