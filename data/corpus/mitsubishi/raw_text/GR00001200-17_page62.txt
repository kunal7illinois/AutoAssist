. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION (COMMENT)
CIRCUIT OPERATION
The cause is probably an open-circuit in the output
This circuit transmits the "N" or "P" position signal of
signal circuit in "N" range.
the park/neutral position switch to the auto-cruise
control-ECU.
.
When the park/neutral position switch is at the "N" or TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
"P" position, auto-cruise control-ECU terminal num- • Malfunction of the park/neutral position switch.

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991223: Harness Set
STEP 1. Check the output circuit voltage at park/neutral
position switch connector B-41 (terminal number 10) by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect park/neutral position switch connector B-
41.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 10 and ground by
backprobing.

range.)
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 • Voltage should be 0.5 volts or less.
(When select lever is in "N" range.)
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage within specifications?
AC002393AD YES : Check that the malfunction is eliminated.
If the malfunction is not eliminated, replace the auto-
cruise control-ECU. (Refer to P.17-86.)
Then check that the malfunction is eliminated.
NO : Go to Step 2.
