MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-51
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check connector B-14 at the barometric pressure
sensor and connector C-60 at ECM <M/T> or connector C-
54 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-14
YES : Repair harness wire between barometric pressure
sensor connector B-14 terminal 2 and ECM connector
C-60 terminal 85 <M/T> or PCM connector C-54
BAROMETRIC
PRESSURE terminal 55 <A/T> because of open circuit or harness
SENSOR damage. Then go to Step 18.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 18.

STEP 7. Check the sensor supply voltage at barometric
pressure sensor connector B-14 by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector B-14.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground by
backprobing.
• Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
