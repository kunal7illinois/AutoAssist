SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-565
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 8. Check the door lock switch (power window sub
switch).
Remove the power window sub switch.Refer to GROUP 42,
CONNECTOR: E-05 Door − Door Trim and Waterproof Film P.42-54. Then check
FRONT DOOR (RH) continuity between the switch terminals.

UNLOCK 2 − 3 Less than 2 ohm
Q:Is the door lock switch (power window sub switch) in
good condition?
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Replace the power window sub switch. If the central
door locking system works normally, input signal from
the door lock switch should be normal.

STEP 9. Measure at power window sub switch connector
E-05 in order to check the ground circuit to the power
window sub switch.
(1) Disconnect power window sub switch connector E-05, and

(2) Measure the resistance value between terminal 2 and
ground.
• The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.
CONNECTOR E-05 Q:Does the measured resistance value correspond with
(HARNESS SIDE) this range?
YES : Go to Step 12.
NO : Go to Step 10.
