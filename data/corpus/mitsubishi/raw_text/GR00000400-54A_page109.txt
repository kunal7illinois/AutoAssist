HEADLIGHT, FRONT SIDE MARKER LIGHT AND POSITION LIGHT ASSEMBLY
HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT
1. The low beam headlight will project on the screen upper
edge of the beam (cut-off).
2. Turn the adjusting screws to achieve the specified low-beam
cut-off location on the aiming screen.

CAUTION
ACX01800AB
Do not cover a headlight for more than three minutes to
prevent the plastic headlight lens deformation.
4. There is no horizontal aim adjustment. Horizontal aim is
preset and does not require adjustment. High-beam pattern
should be correct when the low-beams are adjusted
properly.
LUMINOUS INTENSITY MEASUREMENT
M1542001000196
1. Set the headlights to high-beam.
2. Using a photometer, and following its manufacturer’s
instruction manual, measure the headlight center intensity
and check to be sure that the limit value is satisfied.
Limit: 40,000 cd or more {When a screen is set 18.3m
(60.0 feet) ahead of the vehicle}
NOTE: When measuring the intensity, maintain an engine
speed of 2,000 r/min, with the battery fully charged.
There may be special local regulations pertaining to headlight
intensity. Be sure to make any adjustments necessary to satisfy
such regulations.
If an illuminometer is used to make the measurements, convert
its values to photometer values by using the following formula.
I =2Er:
• I = intensity (cd)
• E = illumination (lux)
• r = distance (m) from headlights to illuminometer
