11.Check that the A/T fluid level is at the "COLD" mark on the
<2.4L ENGINE>
dipstick. If the level is lower than this, pour in more A/T fluid.
12.Drive the vehicle until the A/T fluid temperature rises to the
normal temperature [70 − 80°C (158 − 176°F)], and then
check the A/T fluid level again. If it takes some amount of
time until the A/T fluid reaches its normal operating
temperature [70 − 80°C (158 − 176°F)], check the A/T fluid
level by referring to the diagram at left. The A/T fluid level
must be at the "HOT" mark.
<3.0L ENGINE> NOTE: The A/T fluid temperature is measured with scan tool
(MUT-II). The "COLD" level is for reference only; the "HOT"
level should be regarded as the standard level.
