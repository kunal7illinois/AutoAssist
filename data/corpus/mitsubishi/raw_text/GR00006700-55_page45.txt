If a new compressor is installed, first adjust the amount of oil
according to the procedures described below, and then install
the compressor.
1. Measure the amount [X cm3 (X floz)] of oil within the
removed compressor.
2. Drain (from the new compressor) the amount of oil
calculated according to the following formula, and then
install the new compressor.
New compressor oil amount
100 cm3 − X cm3 = Y cm3 (3.4 floz − X floz = Y floz)
NOTE: Y cm3 (Y floz) indicates the amount of oil in the refriger-
ant line, the condenser, the evaporator, etc.
