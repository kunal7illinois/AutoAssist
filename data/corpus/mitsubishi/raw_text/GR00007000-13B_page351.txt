MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-351
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 7. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to
Procedure 3 − Catalytic Converter Monitor P.13B-6.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0431 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
