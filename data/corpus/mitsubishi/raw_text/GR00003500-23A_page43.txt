DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
.
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 11:
Throttle Position Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to data reading mode for item 11:
Throttle Position Sensor.
• With the throttle valve in idle position, voltage should be
between 535 and 735 mV.
• With the throttle valve in full-open position, voltage
should be between 4,500 and 5,500 mV.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground by
backprobing.
• With the throttle valve in idle position, voltage should be
B-07 CONNECTOR
between 0.535 and 0.735 volts.
HARNESS SIDE VIEW
• With the throttle valve in full-open position, voltage
should be between 4.5 and 5.5 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 3.
AC001548AC NO : Go to Step 7.
