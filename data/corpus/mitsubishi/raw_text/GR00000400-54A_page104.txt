54A-104 CHASSIS ELECTRICAL
COMBINATION METERS ASSEMBLY AND VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR
THERMISTOR
CAUTION
After finishing this test, wipe the unit dry and install it in
the fuel tank.
1. Connect the fuel gauge unit (thermistor) to the battery via a
THERMISTOR test light (12V − 3.4W). Immerse in water.
GROUND THERMISTOR
2. Condition is good if the light goes off when the thermistor is
immersed in water and comes on when it is taken out of
ILLUMINATED water.
3. If all check result are correct, the fuel gauge unit is OK. If
either check result is not correct, replace the fuel gauge unit.

1. Drain the engine coolant. (Refer to GROUP 00,
Maintenance Service − Engine Coolant P.00-56.)
2. Remove the engine coolant temperature gauge unit.
3. Immerse the unit in 70°C (158°F) water to measure the
resistance.
Standard value: 104 ± 13.5 ohms
Reference value
Temperature Resistance
50°C (122°F) 230 Ω
60°C (140°F) 155 Ω
80°C (176°F) 73 Ω

4. If within the standard value, the sensor is OK. Reinstall it,
then check the engine coolant temperature gauge (Refer to
P.54A-106). If not within the standard value, replace it.
5. After checking, apply the 3M(cid:1) AAD Part No. 8731 or
equivalent around the threads of the engine coolant
temperature gauge unit.
6. Add engine coolant. (Refer to GROUP 00, Maintenance
Service − Engine Coolant P.00-56.)
