MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 10. Check for harness damage between injector
connector and ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> connector.
a. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-01
CONNECTOR : B-01, B-02, B-05, B-06
terminal 2 and ECM connector C-49 terminal 1 <M/T> or
B-01 B-02 B-05B-06
PCM connector C-50 terminal 1 <A/T> when checking No. 1
cylinder.
b. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-02
terminal 2 and ECM connector C-49 terminal 14 <M/T> or
PCM connector C-50 terminal 9 <A/T> when checking No. 2
cylinder.
c. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-05
terminal 2 and ECM connector C-49 terminal 2 <M/T> or
AAKK000000227733AB
PCM connector C-50 terminal 24 <A/T> when checking No.
CONNECTORS:C-49<M/T>,C-50<A/T> 3 cylinder.
d. Check the harness wire between injector connector B-06
terminal 2 and ECM connector C-49 terminal 15 <M/T> or
ECM<M/T>
OR PCM connector C-50 terminal 2 <A/T> when checking No. 4
PCM<A/T>
cylinder.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
YES : Check the following items, and repair or replace the
defective items.
C-49,C-50
a. Check the ignition coil, spark plugs, spark plug

cables.
b. Check if the injectors are clogged.
c. Check if fuel is contaminated.
d. Check compression.
Then confirm that the malfunction symptom is
eliminated.
NO : Repair it. Then confirm that the malfunction symptom
is eliminated.
