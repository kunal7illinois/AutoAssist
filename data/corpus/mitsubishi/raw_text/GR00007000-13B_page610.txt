13B-610 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the power supply voltage at MFI relay
harness side connector A-18X.
(1) Disconnect the connector A-18X and measure at the
harness side.
(2) Measure the voltage between terminal 1, 2 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 4.
22 11 NO : Check harness connector C-07 at intermediate
44 33 connector for damage, and repair or replace as
required. Refer to, GROUP 00E, Harness Connector
A-18X HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate connector is in
good condition, repair harness wire between fusible
AK101240AC link (3) and MFI relay connector A-18X terminal 1, 2
because of open circuit. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 4. Check connector C-62 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-59 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-62<M/T>, C-59<A/T>
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T>
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
