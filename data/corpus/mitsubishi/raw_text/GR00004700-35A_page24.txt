DISC BRAKE ROTOR CHECK
M1351002900174
CAUTION
Disc brakes must be kept within the allowable
service values in order to maintain normal brake
operation.
Before turning the brake disc, the following condi-
tions should be checked.
INSPECTION ITEMS REMARKS
Scratches, rust, saturated lining materials and wear • If the vehicle is not driven for a long period of
time, sections of the discs that are not in contact
with the pads will become rusty, causing noise
and shuddering.
• If grooves and scratches resulting from excessive
disc wear are not removed prior to installing a new
pad assembly, there will be inadequate contact
between the disc and the lining (pad) until the
pads conform to the disc.
Run-out Excessive run-out of the discs will increase the pedal
depression resistance due to piston kick-back.
Change in thickness (parallelism) If the thickness of the disc changes, this will cause
pedal pulsation, shuddering and surging.
Warping (flatness) or distortion Overheating and improper handling while servicing
will cause warping or distortion.
