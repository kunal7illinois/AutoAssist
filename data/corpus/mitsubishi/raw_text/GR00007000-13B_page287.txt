MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-287
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the injector.
(1) Disconnect the injector connector B-01 <No. 1 cylinder> or
CONNECTORS : B-01, B-05, B-26
B-05 <No. 3 cylinder> or B-26 <No. 5 cylinder>.
B-05 B-26
B-01
AK000210AB
(2) Measure the resistance between injector side connector
terminal 1 and 2.
INJECTOR SIDE Standard value: 13 − 16 ohm [at 20°C (68°F)]
CONNECTOR
Q:Is the resistance standard value?
1 2 YES : Repair harness wire between injector intermediate
connector and injector connector because of open
circuit or short circuit to ground or harness
damage.
a. Repair harness wire between injector
AK000241AB intermediate connector B-48 terminal 1 and
injector connector B-01 terminal 1 and harness
wire between injector connector B-01 terminal
2 and injector intermediate connector B-48
terminal 2 when checking No. 1 cylinder.
b. Repair harness wire between injector
intermediate connector B-48 terminal 1 and
injector connector B-05 terminal 1 and harness
wire between injector connector B-05 terminal
2 and injector intermediate connector B-48
terminal 3 when checking No. 3 cylinder.
c. Repair harness wire between injector
intermediate connector B-48 terminal 1 and
injector connector B-26 terminal 1 and harness
wire between injector connector B-26 terminal
2 and injector intermediate connector B-48
terminal 4 when checking No. 5 cylinder.
Then go to Step 12.
NO : Replace the injector. Then go to Step 12.
