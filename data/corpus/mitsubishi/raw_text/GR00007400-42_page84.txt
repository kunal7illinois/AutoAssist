SECRET CODE REGISTRATION METHOD
M1428001000054
Each individual secret code is registered inside the transmitter,
and so it is necessary to resister these codes with the
EEPROM inside the receiver in the following cases.
• When the transmitter or ETACS-ECU is replaced
• If more transmitters are to be used
• If it appears that a problem is occurring because of faulty
registration of a code.
A maximum of four different codes can be stored in the
EEPROM memory (four different transmitters can be used).
When the code for the first transmitter is registered, the previ-
ously registered codes for all transmitters are cleared. There-
fore, if you are using four transmitters or are adding more
transmitters, the codes for all transmitters must be registered at
the same time.
1. Check that the doors lock normally when the key is used.
2. Insert the ignition key.
