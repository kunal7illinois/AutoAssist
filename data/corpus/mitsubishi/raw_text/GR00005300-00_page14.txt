SIMULATION TESTS
NOTE: In case of difficulty in finding the cause of the intermit-
tent malfunction, the data recorder function in the scan tool is
effective.
For these simulation tests, shake, then gently bend, pull, and
twist the wiring of each of these examples to duplicate the inter-
mittent malfunction.
• Shake the connector up-and-down, and right-and-left.
• Shake the wiring harness up-and-down, and right-and-left.
Especially, check the splice points of wiring harnesses care-
fully. Refer to GROUP 80B, SPLICE LOCATION P.00E-2.
• Vibrate the part or sensor.
