13B-618 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at fuel pump relay
1 harness side connector C-107.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-107 and measure at the
harness side.
AK103836
(2) Measure the voltage between terminal 4 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : . Check harness connectors C-89 and C-112 at
intermediate connector for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to, GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
connectors are in good condition, repair harness wire
between dedicated fuse and fuel pump relay 1
connector C-107 terminal 4 because of open circuit.
Then confirm that the malfunction symptom is
eliminated.
STEP 5. Check the power supply voltage at fuel pump relay
1 harness side connector C-107.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-107 and measure at the
harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Check harness connector C-111 at intermediate
connector for damage, and repair or replace as
required. Refer to, GROUP 00E, Harness Connector
Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate connector is in
good condition, repair harness wire between ignition
switch connector C-87 terminal 2 and fuel pump relay
1 connector C-107 terminal 3 because of open circuit.
Then confirm that the malfunction symptom is
