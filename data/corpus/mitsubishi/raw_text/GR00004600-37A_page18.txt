Perform air bleeding procedure as necessary after replacing
the steering gear box or the steering fluid lines.
1. Raise and support the front wheels.
2. Disconnect the high-tension cable. Turn the steering wheel
all the way to the left and right five or six times while using
the starter motor to crank the engine intermittently several
times (for 15 to 20 seconds).

• Be careful not to place the high-tension cable near the
fuel rail.

between the high and low dipstick marks.
6. Confirm that there is very little change in the fluid level when
the steering wheel is turned left and right.
7. Confirm that the change in the fluid level is no more than 5

complete, there will be abnormal noises from the pump
and the flow-control valve, and this condition could cause
reduce the life of the power steering components.
