MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-305
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely • Injector failed.
causes for this code to be set are: ) • ECM failed. <M/T>
• Ignition system related part (s) failed. • PCM failed. <A/T>
• Low compression pressure.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Check the spark plugs.
CAUTION
Do not attempt to adjust the gap of the platinum plug.
Cleaning of the platinum plug may result in damage to the
platinum tips. Therefore, if carbon deposits must be
removed, use a plug cleaner and complete cleaning within
20 seconds to protect the electrode. Do not use a wire
brush.
(1) For the right bank cylinder, remove the intake manifold.
PLATINUM
TIPS (2) Check the plug gap and replace if the limit is exceeded.
Standard value: 1.0 − 1.1 mm (0.039 − 0.043 inch)
AAKKXX0000338833AB Limit: 1.3 mm (0.051 inch)
Q:Is the plug gap at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Replace the spark plug. Then go to Step 9.
STEP 2. Check the spark plug cable.
(1) Check the cap and coating for cracks.
(2) Measure the resistance.
Limit: maximum 22 kΩ
Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the spark plug cable. Then go to Step 9.
