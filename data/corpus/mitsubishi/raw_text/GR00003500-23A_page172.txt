AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
STEP 10. Check the switch output voltage at PCM
connector C-61 <2.4L Engine> or C-63 <3.0L Engine> by
backprobing. ("N" position)
Measure the voltage between terminal 121 and ground by
C-61 <2.4L ENGINE> OR
backprobing.
C-63 <3.0L ENGINE>
• When selector lever position is "P," voltage should be 0.5
CONNECTOR HARNESS
SIDE VIEW volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "R," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.
• When selector lever position is "N," voltage should be bat-
tery positive voltage.
• When selector lever position is "D," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less.

• When selector lever position is "3," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less. <Vehicles without sport mode>
• When selector lever position is "2," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less. <Vehicles without sport mode>
• When selector lever position is "L," voltage should be 0.5
volt or less. <Vehicles without sport mode>
• When selector lever position is sport mode, voltage should
be 0.5 volt or less. <Vehicles with sport mode>
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 13.
NO : Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Go to Step 11 <Vehicles with sport mode>. Repair
harness damage between the Park/Neutral position
switch connector B-41 terminal 4 and PCM connector
C-61 terminal 121 <Vehicles without sport mode>.
