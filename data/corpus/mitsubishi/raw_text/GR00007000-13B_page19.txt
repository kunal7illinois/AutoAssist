Inspection • Engine coolant temperature: 80°C (176°F) or more
conditions • Atmospheric temperature: 5°C (41°F) or more
• A/C switch: OFF
• Condition of A/T: Selector lever D range
Test 1.Engine: start
procedure 2.Accelerate until the vehicle speed is 56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40 mph).
3.Travel for 20 seconds or more while keeping the vehicle speed at 56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40
mph). (M/T = 4th speed)
4.Fully close the throttle from an engine speed of 2,000 − 3,000 r/min, and decelerate to
approx. 900 r/min without applying the brakes. Do not steer the handle or turn the light
ON/OFF during this time. (During monitor)
5.Accelerate until the vehicle speed reaches 56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40 mph), and travel for 20
seconds or more. Then, repeat steps 4 and 5 and complete 8 monitor sessions.
6.Return the vehicle to the shop, then turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
7.Confirm that the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is not output.
8.If DTC P0401 is output, refer to DTC P0401 − Exhaust Gas Recirculation Flow Insufficient
