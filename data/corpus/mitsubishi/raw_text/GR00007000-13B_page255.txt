MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-255
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the right bank injector resistance at
intermediate connector B-48.
(1) Disconnect the injector intermediate connector B-48.
CONNECTOR:B-48
AK000209AC
(2) Measure the resistance between each male connector side
INJECTOR connector terminal.
INTERMEDIATE
CONNECTOR a. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 2 when
measuring No. 1 cylinder.
b. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 3 when
1 2 measuring No. 3 cylinder.
3 4 c. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 4 when
measuring No. 5 cylinder.
• Resistance should be between 13 and 16 ohm [at 20°C
(68°F)]
AK000240AB
Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Go to Step 7.
STEP 7. Check the right bank injector.
(1) Disconnect the right bank injector connector, which
CONNECTORS : B-01, B-05, B-26
deviates from the standard value at Step 6.
B-05 B-26
B-01
AK000210AB
(2) Measure the resistance between injector side connector
terminal 1 and 2.
INJECTOR SIDE Standard value: 13 − 16 ohm [at 20°C (68°F)]
CONNECTOR
Q:Is the resistance standard value?
1 2 YES : Repair harness wire between injector intermediate
connector and right bank injector connector because
of harness damage. Then go to Step 10.
NO : Replace the injector. Then go to Step 10.
