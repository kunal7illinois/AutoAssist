Wave Pattern Observation Points
Check that the standard wave pattern appears when the idle air
control motor is operating.
Point A:
Presence or absence of induced electromotive force from the
motor turning. (Refer to abnormal wave pattern.)
CONTRAST WITH PROBABLE CAUSE
STANDARD WAVE
PATTERN
Induced electromotive force Malfunction of motor
does not appear or is
extremely small
Point B:
Height of coil back electromotive force
CONTRAST WITH PROBABLE CAUSE
STANDARD WAVE
PATTERN
Coil reverse electromotive Short in the coil
force does not appear or is
extremely small
.
Examples of Abnormal Wave Patterns
Example 1
• Cause of problem
Malfunction of motor. (Motor is not operating.)
• Wave pattern characteristics
Induced electromotive force from the motor turning does not
appear.
