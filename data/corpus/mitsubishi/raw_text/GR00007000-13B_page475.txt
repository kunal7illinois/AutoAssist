MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-475
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 11. Check the sensor supply voltage at vehicle speed
sensor harness side connector B-39.
(1) Disconnect the vehicle speed sensor connector B-39 and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Disconnect the combination meter connector and auto-
cruise control-ECU connector.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts.

YES : Go to Step 12.
NO : Check connector B-36 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connector is in good condition,
AKX01427AG repair harness wire between vehicle speed sensor
connector B-39 terminal 3 and ECM connector C-62
terminal 80 because of short circuit to ground or
harness damage. Then go to Step 17.
STEP 12. Check the vehicle speed sensor.
Refer to GROUP 54, Combination Metres Assembly and Vehi-
cle Speed Sensor − Combination Metres Assembly and Vehicle
Speed Sensor − Inspection P.54A-106.
Q:Is the vehicle speed sensor normal?
YES : Go to Step 13.
NO : Replace the vehicle speed sensor. Then go to Step
17.
STEP 13. Check connector C-62 at ECM for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:C-62
ECM YES : Go to Step 14.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 17.
