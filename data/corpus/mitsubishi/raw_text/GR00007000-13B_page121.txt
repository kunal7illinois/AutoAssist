MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-121
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 13. Check for harness damage between engine
coolant temperature sensor connector B-11 terminal 1 and
ECM connector C-58 terminal 44 <M/T> or PCM connector
C-55 terminal 44 <A/T>.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-11 ENGINE
COOLANT YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 14.
TEMPERATURE NO : Repair it. Then go to Step 14.

STEP 14. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to,

(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0125 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
