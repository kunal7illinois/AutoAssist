STEP 2. Check the trunk lid latch switch ground circuit at
liftgate latch switch connector F-16 <ECLIPSE-Vehicle with
theft-alarm system> or the trunk lid latch switch connector
F-16 <ECLIPSE SPYDER-Vehicle with theft-alarm system>.
(1) Disconnect liftgate latch switch connector F-16 <ECLIPSE-
CONNECTOR <ECLIPSE>: F-16
