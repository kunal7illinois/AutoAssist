MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-387
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 11. Check the sensor supply voltage at vehicle speed
sensor harness side connector B-39.
(1) Disconnect the vehicle speed sensor connector B-39 and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Disconnect the combination meter connector and auto-
cruise control-ECU connector.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts.

YES : Go to Step 12.
NO : Check connector B-36 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connector is in good condition,
AKX01427AG repair harness wire between vehicle speed sensor
connector B-39 terminal 3 and ECM connector C-60
terminal 86 because of short circuit to ground or
harness damage. Then go to Step 17.
STEP 12. Check the vehicle speed sensor.
Refer to GROUP 54A, Combination Metre − Inspection − Vehi-
cle Speed Sensor Check P.54A-237.
Q:Is the vehicle speed sensor normal?
YES : Go to Step 13.
NO : Replace the vehicle speed sensor. Then go to Step
17.
STEP 13. Check connector C-60 at ECM for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:C-60
YES : Go to Step 14.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 17.
