13B-482 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
MFI RELAY 18X terminal 4 and idle air control motor connector B-
34 terminal 2, 5 because of open circuit or short circuit
to ground. Then go to Step 14.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 14.

STEP 7. Check the power supply voltage at ECM connector
C-51 <M/T> or PCM connector C-52 <A/T> by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector C-51 <M/T> or C-52 <A/
T>.
(2) Measure the voltage between terminal 14, 15, 28, 29 and
C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T>
CONNECTOR HARNESS ground by backprobing.
SIDE VIEW • The voltage is 1V or lower for approximately 3 seconds,
then changes to the battery positive voltage when the
Ignition switch is turned from the "LOCK" (OFF) position

(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 10.
NO : Go to Step 8.

STEP 8. Check connector C-51 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-52 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T>
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T>
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 14.
