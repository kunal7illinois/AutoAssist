DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223: Harness Set
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Check scan tool MB991502 communicates with
the MFI system and MFI system DTC output other than
P1610.
Q:Can scan tool MB991502 communicate with the MFI
system? Does MFI system DTC other than P1610 reset?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Refer to GROUP 13A, Diagnosis P.13A-22.
