SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) 52B-19
SRS SERVICE PRECAUTIONS
WARNING
• Inspection of the SRS-ECU connector harness
should be carried out by the following procedure.
Insert the backprobing tool into connector from
SRS-HARNESS CONNECTOR
harness side, and connect the tester to backprob-
ing tool. If any tool other than backprobing tool is
used, it may cause damage to the harness and
other components. Furthermore, measurement
should not be carried out by touching the back-
probing tool directly against the terminals from the
front of the connector. The terminals are plated to
increase their conductivity, so if they are touched
directly by the backprobing tool, the plating may
break, which will decrease reliability.
SRS-ECU HARNESS CONNECTOR • The SRS components should not be subjected to
(REAR SIDE) heat over 93°C (200°F), so remove the SRS-ECU,
air bag modules, and clock spring before drying or
baking the vehicle after painting.
• After servicing the SRS system, check the SRS
warning light operation to make sure that the sys-
AC003072AB tem functions properly. (Refer to P.52B-3.)
• Make certain that the ignition switch is in the
"LOCK" (OFF) position when the scan tool is con-
nected or disconnected.
• If you have any questions about the SRS system,
please contact the MMSA Tech Line.
