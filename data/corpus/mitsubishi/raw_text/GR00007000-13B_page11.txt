GENERAL SCAN
TOOL
07 Evaporation ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EVAP Leak Mon. Gross × 0.032 kPa
leak monitor monitors the leak of fuel Pressure Value
(Gross leak) evaporation gas by checking Test Result and Limit
whether the pressure can be Value (min.) kPa
reduced (the amount of pressure
reduction) using the fuel tank
differential pressure sensor after
sealing the fuel tank and the fuel
line.
08 Evaporation ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EVAP Leak Mon. × 0.032 kPa
leak monitor monitors the leak of fuel 0.5mm Pressure Value
(Very small evaporation gas by the reduction of Test Result and Limit
leak) vacuum in tank after appointed time Value (max.) kPa
using the fuel tank differential
pressure sensor after making the
fuel tank and the fuel line vacuum.
09 Right bank ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> HO2S B1 SENSOR1 × 1 count
heated oxygen monitors the deteriorated condition Rich/Lean Switching
sensor (front) of the right bank heated oxygen Count
monitor (Rich/ sensor (front) by checking the lean/ Test Result and Limit
Lean rich Switching frequency of the right Value (min.)
Switching) bank heated oxygen sensor (front).
0A Left bank ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> HO2S B2 SENSOR1 × 1 count
heated oxygen monitors the deteriorated condition Rich/Lean Switching
sensor (front) of the left bank heated oxygen Count
monitor (Rich/ sensor (front) by checking the lean/ Test Result and Limit
Lean rich Switching frequency of the left Value (min.)
Switching) bank heated oxygen sensor (front).
0B Right bank ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> checks HO2S B1 SENSOR2 × 19.5 mV
heated oxygen the output voltage of the right bank Change in Volt
sensor (rear) heated oxygen sensor (rear) in Test Result and Limit
monitor order to monitor whether the heated Value (min.)
(Voltage) oxygen sensor (rear) output is
stuck.
0C Left bank ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> checks HO2S B2 SENSOR2 × 19.5 mV
heated oxygen the output voltage of the left bank Change in Volt
sensor (rear) heated oxygen sensor (rear) in Test Result and Limit
monitor order to monitor whether the left Value (min.)
(Voltage) bank heated oxygen sensor (rear)
output is stuck.
NOTE: *1: Minimum value: The test fails if test value is less than this value.
NOTE: *2: Maximum value: The test fails if test value is greater than this value.
