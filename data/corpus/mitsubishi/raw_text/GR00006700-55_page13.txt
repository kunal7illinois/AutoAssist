MANUAL A/C DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the blower switch continuity.
Follow the table below to check the blower switch for continuity.
BLOWER SWITCH SWITCH TESTER CONNECTION SPECIFIED
ASSEMBLY POSITION (CONNECTOR A) CONDITION
0 (OFF) 1 − 3, 3 − 4, 3 − 5, 3 − 6 Open circuit
1 (LO) 3 − 5 Less than 2 ohm
2 (ML) 1 − 3 Less than 2 ohm
3 (MH) 3 − 6 Less than 2 ohm
AC001371AB
4 (HI) 3 − 4 Less than 2 ohm
Q:Is the blower switch continuity in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace. Then go to Step 5.
STEP 4. Check the resistor resistance value.
Use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance between the ter-
minals as indicated below. Check that the measured value is at
the standard value.
Standard value:
MEASUREMENT TERMINAL STANDARD VALUE Ω
Between terminals 3 and 2 (LO) 2.3
Between terminals 3 and 4 (ML) 1.1
AC001379AB Between terminals 3 and 1 (MH) 0.4
Q:Is the measured value at the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Replace. Then go to Step 5.
STEP 5. Check symptoms.
Q:Is the blower fan and motor turned?
YES : This diagnosis is complete. (If no malfunctions are not
found in all steps, an intermittent malfunction is
suspected. Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use
Troubleshooting/Inspection Service Points − How to
Cope with Intermittent Malfunction P.00-6.)
NO : Go to Step 1.
