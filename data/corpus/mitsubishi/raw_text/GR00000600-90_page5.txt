CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS 90-5
HOW TO READ CIRCUIT DIAGRAMS
Indicates input/output Indicates a wiring connector which is inside
to/from control unit the equipment and which is not shown in
(current flow direction). the wiring harness configuration diagram.
Input Output Input/ Example C-15-2 Indicates a connector
output
which is inside the
equipment, numbered Indicates that the diagram comes
in order starting from 1. from which belongs to the
block in the same circuit.
Indicates the connector number shown in
the wiring harness configuration diagram.
A broken line indicates that these
connectors are the same interm-
ediate connectors.
Indicates terminal number.
In case two or more connectors
are connected to the same de-
vice, markings indicating the
same connector are connected
by a broken line.
Indicates current flow downward
or upward as controlled by the
control unit.
Indicates harness junction where
wire diameter or color changes.
Indicates intersections at
which the lead wires are
not connected.
Indicates intersections at
which the lead wires are
connected.
Indicates representative vehicle
body ground point. (Same
number as that of ground point in
GROUNDING LOCATION).
Indicates that the terminal is a
spare one if the device (sensor
in this case) is not provided.
