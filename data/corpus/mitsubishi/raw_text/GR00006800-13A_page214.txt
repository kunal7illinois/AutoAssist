13A-214 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check connector C-60 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-54 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTORS:C-60<M/T>,C-54<A/T>
YES : Check connector C-28 and C-90 at intermediate
connector for damage, and repair or replace as
ECM<M/T>
required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector
OR
PCM<A/T> Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate connector are in
good condition, repair harness wire between fuel
temperature sensor connector D-17 terminal 3 and
ECM connector C-60 terminal 77 <M/T> or PCM
C-54 C-60 connector C-54 terminal 51 <A/T> because of open
circuit. Then go to Step 11.

NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 11.
STEP 7. Check connector C-60 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-54 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTORS:C-60<M/T>,C-54<A/T>
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 11.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
ECM<M/T>
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 11.
OR
PCM<A/T>
C-54 C-60

STEP 8. Check the continuity at fuel temperature sensor
harness side connector D-17.
(1) Disconnect the connector D-17 and measure at the harness
D-17 HARNESS side.
SIDE CONNECTOR
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 1 and ground.
33 22 11 • Should be less than 2 ohm.
55 44
Q:Is the continuity normal?
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Repair harness wire between fuel temperature sensor
connector D-17 terminal 1 and ground because of
open circuit or harness damage. Then go to Step 11.
