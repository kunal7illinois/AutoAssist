MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-587
ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
Standard value:
ENGINE HEATED OXYGEN REMARKS
SENSOR OUTPUT
VOLTAGE
When revving 0.6 − 1.0 V If you make the air/
engine fuel ratio rich by
revving the engine
repeatedly, a
normal heated
oxygen sensor will
output a voltage of
0.6 − 1.0 V.
3. If the sensor is defective, replace the heated oxygen sensor.
NOTE: For removal and installation of the heated oxygen sen-
sor, refer to GROUP 15, Exhaust Pipe and Main Muffler P.15-
21.
INJECTOR CHECK
M1131005200082
Measurement of Resistance between Terminals
1. Disconnect the injector connector.
2. Measure resistance between terminals.
Standard value: 13 − 16 Ω [at 20°C (68°F)]
3. If not within specification, replace the injector.
1 2 4. Install the injector connector

Checking operation sound
Using a stethoscope or long blade screwdriver, check the oper-
ation sound ("tick-tick-tick") of injectors during idling or during
cranking. Check that as the engine speed increases, the fre-
quency of the operating sound also increases.
1. If the injector you are checking is not operating, you may
hear the operating sound of the other injectors.
2. If no operating sound is heard from the injector that is being
checked, check the injector drive circuit. If there is nothing
STETHOSCOPE
wrong with the circuit, a defective injector or engine control
module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM)
AK000124AB
<A/T> is suspected.
