DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
• MB991658: Test Harness Set
• MB991709: Test Harness Set
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 73:
Fuel Tank Differential Pressure Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.

side, and plug the hose from which the pipes have been
disconnected.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(4) Remove the fuel cap.
(5) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
73, Fuel Tank Differential Pressure Sensor.
• The fuel tank pressures should be −1.5 to 1.5 kPa (−285
to 285 inHg.)

(6) Connect an evaporative emission system pressure pump to
the fuel filler neck, and apply pressure.
• The scan tool reading should increase.
(7) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position. Then
disconnect scan tool MB991502.
Q:Is the scan tool reading within the specified value?
YES : Go to Step 22.
NO : Go to Step 2.
