13B-544 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the ignition system.
(1) Connect the tachometer to engine speed detection
CONNECTOR: A-12X AC101133
connector A-12X terminal 1.
(2) Crank the engine.
• A tachometer moves.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Does a tachometer move?
ENGINE SPEED YES : Go to Step 6.
DETECTION NO : Refer to INSPECTION PROCEDURE 33 − Ignition
CONNECTOR
Circuit System P.13B-633.

STEP 6. Check the ignition timing.
(1) Check the ignition timing at cranking.
Standard value: 5°BTDC ± 3°
Q:Is the ignition timing normal?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Check that the crankshaft position sensor and timing
belt cover are in the correct position. Then confirm
that the malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 7. Check the left bank injector.
(1) Disconnect the left bank injector connector B-02, B-06, B-
CONNECTORS : B-02, B-06, B-25
25.

(2) Measure the resistance between each injector side
INJECTOR SIDE connector terminal 1 and 2.
CONNECTOR Standard value: 13 − 16 ohm [at 20°C (68°F)]
Q:Is the resistance standard value?
1 2
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Replace the faulty injector. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
