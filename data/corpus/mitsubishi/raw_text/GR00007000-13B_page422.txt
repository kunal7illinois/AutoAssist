13B-422 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the harness wire between ECM connector
C-62 terminal 93 <M/T> or PCM connector C-59 terminal 92
<A/T> and intermediate connector D-16 terminal 5 for
damage.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
CONNECTOR: C-62<M/T>, C-59 <A/T>
YES : Go to Step 22.
NO : Repair it. Then go to 22.
ECM <M/T>
OR
PCM <A/T>
C-59 C-62
<A/T> <M/T>

CONNECTOR: D-16
AC001787AD
STEP 6. Check the 5-volt supply circuit voltage at
intermediate connector D-16.
(1) Use special tools (MB991658 and MB991709) to connect
MB991658 terminals 5, 6 and 8 between connectors of the
MB991709
intermediate connector D-16 respectively.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 8 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 11.
AC002080AB NO : Remove the special tools and connect intermediate
connector D-16. Then go to Step 7.
