DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check the voltage at generator intermediate
connector B-13 by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector B-13.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground by
backprobing.
a. Engine: warming up
b. Radiator fan: stopped

HARNESS
SIDE VIEW • Voltage rises by 0.2 − 3.5 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
AK000365AB Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Replace the generator. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check connector B-13 at generator intermediate
connector for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:B-13
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
