SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-367
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
STEP 20. Check the rear turn-signal light bulb (RH).
(1) Remove the rear turn-signal (RH) light bulb.
(2) Check that the rear turn-signal light bulb (RH) is not broken.
Q:Is the rear turn-signal (RH) light bulb in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 21.
NO : Replace the rear turn-signal (RH) light bulb. Check
that the turn-signal lights illuminate normally.
STEP 21. Measure at rear combination light (RH) connector
F-09 in order to check the ground circuit to the rear turn-
signal light (RH).
(1) Disconnect rear combination light (RH) connector F-09, and
