13C-6 FUEL SUPPLY
FUEL SUPPLY DIAGNOSIS
(13)Stop the engine and observe fuel pressure gauge reading.
It is normal if the reading does not drop within two minutes.
If it does, observe the rate of drop and troubleshoot and
repair according to the table below. Start, then stop the
engine.
a. Squeeze the fuel return line closed to confirm leak-down
occurs from defective fuel pressure regulator.
b. Squeeze the fuel supply line closed to confirm leak-
down occurs from defective fuel pump check valve.
c. If pressure continues to drop with both fuel lines
squeezed closed, injector(s) are leaking.
SYMPTOM PROBABLE CAUSE REMEDY
Fuel pressure drops gradually Leaky injector Replace injector
after engine is stopped
Leaky fuel regulator valve seat Replace fuel pressure regulator
Fuel pressure drops sharply Check valve in fuel pump is held Replace fuel pump
immediately after engine is open
stopped
(14)Release residual pressure from the fuel pipe line. <2.4L>
(Refer to P.13A-580.) <3.0L> (Refer to P.13B-682.)
WARNING
Cover the hose connection with shop towels to pre-
MD998709 vent splash of fuel that could be caused by some
residual pressure in the fuel pipe line.

(17)Fit the high-pressure fuel hose into the fuel rail and tighten
the bolts to specified torque.

Tightening torque: 4.9 ± 1.0 N⋅m (44 ± 8 in-lb)
(18)Check for fuel leaks.
a. Use scan tool MB991502 to operate the fuel pump.
b. Check the fuel line for leaks, and repair as needed.
(19)Disconnect scan tool MB991502.
Q:Is the fuel pressure test in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Repair or replace. Then go to Step 3.
STEP 3. Check for bending, twisting or clogging of the fuel
pipe or hose.
Q:Are the fuel pipe and hose in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Repair or replace. Then go to Step 6.
