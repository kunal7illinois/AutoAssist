Required Special Tools:
• MD998464: Test Harness
• MB991316: Test Harness
• MB991658: Test Harness Set

1. Use scan tool MB991502, observe HO S reading. If values
2
are unsatisfactory, or if the scan tool is not available, use the
following procedure:
(1) Disconnect the heated oxygen sensor connector and
connect special tool MD998464 to the connector on the
heated oxygen sensor side.
(2) Make sure that there is continuity [4.5 − 8.0 ohm at 20°C
HEATED
(68°F)] between terminal 1 (red clip of special tool) and
OXYGEN
SENSOR terminal 3 (blue clip of special tool) on the heated oxygen
EQUIPMENT sensor connector.

sensor.
BLUE (4) Warm up the engine until engine coolant is 80°C (176°F)
or higher.

CAUTION
Be very careful when connecting the jumper wires; incor-
JUMPER rect connection can damage the heated oxygen sensor.
WIRES (5) Use the jumper wires to connect terminal 1 (red clip) of
BLACK the heated oxygen sensor connector to the positive
RED
battery terminal and terminal 3 (blue clip) to the negative
battery terminal.
(6) Connect a digital voltage meter between terminal 2 (black
WHITE BLUE clip) and terminal 4 (white clip).
2. While repeatedly revving the engine, measure the heated
MD998464 oxygen sensor output voltage.

Standard value:
ENGINE HEATED OXYGEN REMARKS
SENSOR OUTPUT
VOLTAGE
When revving 0.6 − 1.0 volt If you make the air/
engine fuel ratio rich by
revving the engine
repeatedly, a
normal heated
oxygen sensor will
output a voltage of
0.6 − 1.0 volt.
3. If the sensor is defective, replace the heated oxygen sensor.
NOTE: For removal and installation of the heated oxygen sen-
sor, refer to GROUP 15, Exhaust Pipe and Main Muffler P.15-
22.
