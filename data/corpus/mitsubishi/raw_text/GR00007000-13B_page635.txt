MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-635
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check connector B-22 at distributor for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: B-22
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.

STEP 2. Check the ignition coil.
Refer to GROUP 16, Ignition System − On-vehicle service −
Ignition coil check P.16-37.
Q:Are there any abnormalities?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Repair the ignition coil. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 3. Check the ignition power transistor.
Refer to GROUP 16, Ignition System − On-vehicle service −
Power transistor check P.16-37.
Q:Are there any abnormalities?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Repair the ignition power transistor. Then confirm that
the malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at distributor
connector B-22.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-22 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.

NO : Check connector C-07, C-89, C-108 and C-111 at
intermediate connectors for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
connectors are in good condition, repair harness wire

between ignition switch connector C-87 terminal 2
and distributor connector B-22 terminal 1 because of
open circuit. Then confirm that the malfunction
symptom is eliminated.
