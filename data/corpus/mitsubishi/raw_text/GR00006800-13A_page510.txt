13A-510 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the ignition switch-IG signal voltage at ECM
harness side connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM harness side
connector C-57 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-60 <M/T> or C-57 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 82 <M/T> or 98 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground.
C-60 HARNESS • Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
SIDE CONNECTOR (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?

9291908988878685848382 YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Check harness connector C-07, C-89, C-111 and C-
112 at intermediate connector for damage, and repair
or replace as required. Refer to, GROUP 00E,
Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If
