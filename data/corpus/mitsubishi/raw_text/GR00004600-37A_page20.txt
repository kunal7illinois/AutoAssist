METER 1. Disconnect the pressure hose from the oil pump, and then
connect special tools MB991548, MB990662 and
MB991549.
2. Bleed air, and then turn the steering wheel several times
while the vehicle is not moving so that the temperature of
the fluid rises to approximately 50 − 60°C (122 − 140°F).
3. The engine should be idling.
OIL
4. Disconnect the connector for the oil pressure switch, and
PUMP
place an ohmmeter.
ADAPTER 5. Gradually close the shut-off valve of the pressure gauge and
RESERVOIR
(MB991549) increase the hydraulic pressure, then check whether or not
the hydraulic pressure that activates the switch is the
standard value.
Standard value: 1.8 − 2.4 MPa (261 − 348 psi)
ACX01134AB
6. Gradually open the shut-off valve and reduce the hydraulic
pressure; then check whether or not the hydraulic pressure
that deactivates the switch is the standard value.
Standard value: 0.8 − 2.4 MPa (116 − 348 psi)
7. Remove special tools MB991548, MB990662 and
MB991549, and then tighten the pressure hose to the
specified torque.
Tightening torque: 57 ± 7 N⋅m (42 ± 5 ft-lb)
8. Bleed the system.
