DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Check the exhaust leaks.
Q:Are there any abnormalities?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair it. Then go to Step 7.
STEP 2. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 59:
Heated Oxygen Sensor Bank 2, Sensor 2 (left rear).
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
59, Heated Oxygen Sensor Bank 2, Sensor 2 (left rear).
16 PIN • Warming up the engine. When the engine is revved, the
output voltage should repeat 0 volt and 0.6 to 1.0 volt

(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Refer to DTC P0156 − Heated Oxygen Sensor Circuit
