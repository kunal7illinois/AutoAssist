AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, carry out the actuator
test item 01: Low-Reverse Solenoid Valve.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to actuator test mode for item 01:
Low-Reverse Solenoid Valve.
• An operation sound should be heard from solenoid
valve when solenoid valve is operated.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
16 PIN Q:Is the solenoid valve operating properly?
YES : Go to Step 2.
MB991502
AC001252AD NO : Repair or replace the low-reverse solenoid valve.
Refer to GROUP 23B, Valve Body P.23B-74. Then
confirm that the symptom is eliminated.
STEP 2. Check when shock occurs.
Q:When does the shock occur?
When engaging from N to R : Go to Step 3.
When the vehicle starts moving : Go to Step 7.
STEP 3. Check the hydraulic pressure (for reverse clutch).
Measure the hydraulic pressure for reverse clutch when the
selector lever is at the "R" range. Check if the hydraulic pres-
sure is within the standard value. Refer to P.23A-26, Hydraulic
Pressure Test.
Q:Is the hydraulic pressure within the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Go to Step 9.
STEP 4. Check the hydraulic pressure (for low-reverse
brake).
Measure the hydraulic pressure for low-reverse brake when the
selector lever is at the "R" range. Check if the hydraulic pres-
sure is within the standard value. Refer to P.23A-26, Hydraulic
Pressure Test.
Q:Is the hydraulic pressure within the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Go to Step 9.
