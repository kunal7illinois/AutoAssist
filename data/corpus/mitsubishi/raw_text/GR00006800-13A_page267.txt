MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 59:
Heated Oxygen Sensor (rear).
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
59, Heated Oxygen Sensor (rear).
16 PIN • Warming up the engine. When the engine is revved, the
output voltage should repeat 0 volt and 0.6 to 1.0 volt

STEP 3. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 11:
Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
(1) Start the engine and run at idle.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
11, Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
• Warming up the engine. When the engine is revved, the
output voltage should be 0.6 to 1.0 volt.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
