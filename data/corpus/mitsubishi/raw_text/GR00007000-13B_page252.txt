13B-252 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 16. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to
Procedure 2 − Fuel Trim Monitor P.13B-6.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0171 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
DTC P0172: System too Rich (bank 1)
. • Volume air flow sensor output frequency is 75 Hz
System too Rich (bank 1) Circuit
• Refer to DTC P0201, P0203, P0205 − Injector or less.
Circuit P.13B-283. Judgment Criteria
• Long-term fuel trim has continued to be lower
. CIRCUIT OPERATION than −12.5 percent for 5 seconds.
• Refer to DTC P0201, P0203, P0205 − Injector or
Circuit P.13B-283. • Short-term fuel trim has continued to be lower
than −12.5 percent for 5 seconds.
