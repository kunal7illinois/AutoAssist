MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-379
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Check connectors C-28, C-90 and D-16 at
MFI RELAY intermediate connector for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
connectors are in good condition, repair harness wire
between MFI relay connector A-18X terminal 4 and
evaporative emission ventilation solenoid connector
D-10 terminal 2 because of open circuit or short circuit
to ground. Then go to Step 12.

NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
STEP 6. Check the power supply voltage at ECM connector
C-51 <M/T> or PCM connector C-52 <A/T> by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector C-51 <M/T> or C-52 <A/
T>.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 35 and ground by
backprobing.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.

C-52 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T>
YES : Go to Step 8.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
