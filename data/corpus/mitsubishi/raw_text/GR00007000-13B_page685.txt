<Right bank and left bank heated oxygen sensor (rear)>
1. Use scan tool MB991502, observe HO2S reading. If values
are unsatisfactory, or if the scan tool is not available, use the
following procedure:
(1) Disconnect the heated oxygen sensor connector and
connect special tool MB991316 to the connector on the
heated oxygen sensor side.
(2) Make sure that there is continuity [11 − 18 ohm at 20°C
HEATED (68°F)] between terminal 1 (red clip of special tool) and
OXYGEN
terminal 3 (blue clip of special tool) on the heated oxygen
SENSOR
RED EQUIPMENT sensor connector.
SIDE (3) If there is no continuity, replace the heated oxygen
CONNECTOR sensor.

(4) Warm up the engine until engine coolant is 80°C (176°F)
or higher.

CAUTION
Be very careful when connecting the jumper wires; incor-
rect connection can damage the heated oxygen sensor.

WIRES (5) Use the jumper wires to connect terminal 1 (red clip) of
BLACK the heated oxygen sensor connector to the positive
RED
battery terminal and terminal 3 (blue clip) to the negative
battery terminal.
(6) Connect a digital voltage meter between terminal 2 (black
BLUE clip) and terminal 4 (white clip).

2. While repeatedly revving the engine, measure the heated
MB991316
oxygen sensor output voltage.

Standard value:
ENGINE HEATED OXYGEN REMARKS
SENSOR OUTPUT
VOLTAGE
When revving 0.6 − 1.0 volt If you make the air/
engine fuel ratio rich by
revving the engine
repeatedly, a
normal heated
oxygen sensor will
output a voltage of
0.6 − 1.0 volt.
3. If the sensor is defective, replace the heated oxygen sensor.
NOTE: For removal and installation of the heated oxygen sen-
sor, refer to GROUP 15, Exhaust Pipe and Main Muffler P.15-
22.
