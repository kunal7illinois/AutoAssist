WHEEL AND TIRE DIAGNOSIS
WHEEL BALANCER CALIBRATION CHECKING FLOW CHART
Balance wheel.
ZERO CALIBRATION
Rotate wheel 1/2 turn. CHECK
Imbalance = 5g (0.18oz) or less Imbalance = more than 5g (0.18oz)
Rebalance wheel.
Rotate wheel 1/4 turn.
Imbalance = 5g (0.18oz) or less Imbalance = more than 5g (0.18oz)
Verify wheel is properly centered.
Verify cones, cup, and wing nut are clean,
undamaged, and appropriate for wheel.
Make necessary corrections, then recheck
wheel balance.
STATIC BALANCE
Attach a 5-g (0.18-oz) weight to the outer rim.
CHECK
Is the imbalance 5 ± 2g (0.18 ± 0.06oz) at 170 – 190
degree angle away from the 5-g (0.18-oz) weight?
YES NO
DYNAMIC BALANCE
Attach a 5-g (0.18-oz) weight to the inner rim at 180
CHECK
degree angle opposite the weight on the outer rim.
Is the imbalance 5 ± 2g (0.18 ± 0.06oz) at 170 – 190
degree angle away from both 5-g (0.18-oz) weights?
YES NO
Balancer does not require Balancer requires calibration.
