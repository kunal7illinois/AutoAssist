DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991223: Harness Set
STEP 1. Check the auto-cruise control indicator bulb.
(1) Remove the combination meter.
Refer to GROUP 54A, Combination Meter Assembly and
Vehicle Speed Sensor P.54A-105.
(2) Check the auto-cruise control indicator bulb.
Q:Is the bulb blown?
YES : Replace the bulb.
Then check that the malfunction is eliminated.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check the output circuit voltage at auto-cruise
control-ECU connector C-20 (terminal number 15) by
backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect auto-cruise control switch connector C-
20.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 15 and ground by
backprobing.
