STEP 1. Check the wheel speed sensor installation.
Q:Is the wheel speed sensor bolted securely in place at
FRONT WHEEL REAR WHEEL
SPEED SENSOR SPEED SENSOR the front knuckle or the rear knuckle?
YES : Go to Step 2.

STEP 2. Check wheel speed sensor circuit at the ABS-ECU
connector A-02.
(1) Disconnect the connector A-02 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Measure the resistance between the ABS-ECU connector
A-02 (HARNESS SIDE)
terminals 1 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, or 8 and 9.
Standard Value: 1.28 − 1.92 kΩ
Q:Is the resistance between terminals 1 and 3, 4 and 5, 6
and 7, or 8 and 9 within the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO <terminals 6 and 7> : Go to Step 3.
NO <terminals 4 and 5> : Go to Step 4.
NO <terminals 1 and 3, 8 and 9> : Go to Step 5.

STEP 3. Check the harness wires between the ABS-ECU
connector A-02 (terminals 6 and 7) and the wheel speed
sensor <front: LH> connector A-22 (terminals 1 and 2).
NOTE: After inspecting the intermediate connector C-06,
CONNECTOR: C-06
inspect the wires. If the intermediate connector C-06 is dam-
aged, repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Con-
nector Inspection P.00E-2. If the connector has been repaired
