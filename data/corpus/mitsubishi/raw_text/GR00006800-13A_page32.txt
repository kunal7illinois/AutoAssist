13A-32 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check the reset signal voltage at volume air flow
sensor connector B-14 by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect the connector B-14.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 7 and ground by
backprobing.
• When the engine idling, voltage should be 1.0 volt or
less.
B-14 CONNECTOR • When the engine speed is 3,000 r/min, voltage should
HARNESS
be between 6.0 and 9.0 volts.

Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 8.
AKX01515AC NO : Go to Step 6.
STEP 6. Check connector B-14 at volume air flow sensor
and connector C-49 at ECM <M/T> or connector C-50 at
PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-14
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 9.
