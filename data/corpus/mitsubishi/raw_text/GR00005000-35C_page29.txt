(with engine stopped)>. When the ABS-ECU • Damaged wiring harness or connector
completes the self-check, it turns off the light. • Malfunction of the hydraulic unit (integrated with
ABS-ECU)

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991223: Harness Set
.
STEP 1. Check the TCL indicator light circuit at the ABS-
ECU connector A-02.
(1) Disconnect the ABS-ECU connector A-02.
CONNECTOR: A-02
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
Q:Does the TCL indicator light illuminate?
