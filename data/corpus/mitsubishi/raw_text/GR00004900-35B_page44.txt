below.
1. Measure the voltages between terminals (16) and
(19) (ground terminals) and each respective
terminal.
AC002089AB
NOTE: Do not measure terminal voltage for approximately three seconds after the ignition switch is turned to
the "ON" position. The ABS-ECU performs the initial check during that period.
