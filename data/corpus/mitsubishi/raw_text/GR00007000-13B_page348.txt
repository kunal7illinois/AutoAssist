13B-348 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 4. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 39:
Heated Oxygen Sensor Bank 1, Sensor 1 (right front).
(1) Start the engine and run at idle.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
39, Heated Oxygen Sensor Bank 1, Sensor 1 (right front).
(3) Keep the engine speed at 2,000 r/min.
• 0 − 0.4 and 0.6 − 1.0 volt should alternate 15 times or
more within 10 seconds.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
16 PIN
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
MB991502 YES : Go to Step 5.
AKX01177AB NO : Replace the right bank heated oxygen sensor (front).
Then go to Step 7.
STEP 5. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to
Procedure 3 − Catalytic Converter Monitor P.13B-6.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0421 is output?
YES : Replace the right bank side catalytic converter. Then
go to Step 6.
NO : The inspection is complete.
STEP 6. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to
Procedure 3 − Catalytic Converter Monitor P.13B-6.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0421 is output?
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 7.
NO : The inspection is complete.
STEP 7. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to
Procedure 3 − Catalytic Converter Monitor P.13B-6.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0421 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
