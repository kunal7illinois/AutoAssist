ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR CHECK
M1131003200213
Required Special Tool:
• MB991348: Test Harness Set
.
Checking the Terminal Resistance
1. Disconnect the throttle position sensor connector.
2. Measure the resistance between throttle position sensor
THROTTLE POSITION side connector terminals 1 and 4.
SENSOR SIDE CONNECTOR
Standard value: 3.5 − 6.5 kΩ

3. Measure the resistance between throttle position sensor
side connector terminals 1 and terminal 3.
Normal condition:
Throttle valve slowly open Changes smoothly in
AKX01413AB until fully open from the idle proportion to the opening
position angle of the throttle valve
4. If the resistance is outside the standard value, or if it doesn’t
change smoothly, replace the throttle position sensor.
NOTE: After replacement, the throttle position sensor should
be adjusted. (Refer to P.13B-677 .)
.
Check using oscilloscope
1. Disconnect the throttle position sensor connector and
connect the test harness special tool (MB991348) in
between. (All terminals should be connected.)
2. Connect the oscilloscope probe to the throttle position

4. Slowly move the throttle lever from the idle position to the
NORMAL WAVEFORM
full-throttle position and check then if the waveform is free

from any noise.
FULL-THROTTLE
POSITION 5. If any noise is recognized, replace the throttle position
sensor.
THROTTLE NOTE: After replacement, the throttle position sensor should
