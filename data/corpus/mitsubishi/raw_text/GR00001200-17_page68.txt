17-68 ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL
AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
STEP 1. Check the vehicle speed sensor.
(1) Remove the vehicle speed sensor and connect a 3 − 10 kΩ
resistor as shown in the illustration.
(2) Turn the shaft of the vehicle speed sensor and check that
TURN there is voltage between terminals 2 − 3. (one turn = four
pulses.)
SHAFT
Q:Is the voltage within specifications?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Replace the vehicle speed sensor.
Refer to GROUP 54A, Combination Meter Assembly
and Vehicle Speed Sensor P.54A-105.
Then check that the malfunction is eliminated.

STEP 2. Check the auto-cruise vacuum pump.
(1) Disconnect the vacuum hose from the auto-cruise vacuum
pump and connect a vacuum gauge to the vacuum pump.
(2) Disconnect the vacuum pump connector.
(3) Check the auto-cruise vacuum pump and valves according
VACUUM to the following procedure:
GAUGE • Connect the positive battery terminal to auto-cruise vac-
uum pump connector terminal 1, and the negative bat-
tery terminal to terminals 2, 3, and 4.
Then the vacuum gauge should read 27 kPa (8.0 in Hg)
or more.
• The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.
Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 2 is disconnected from the negative bat-
tery terminal while terminals 1, and 3 remain connected.
• The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.
CONTROL RELEASE
VALVE VALVE Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 3 is disconnected from the negative bat-
tery terminal while terminals 1, and 2 remain connected.
Q:Are all of the above values satisfied?
ACX01181AB
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the auto-cruise vacuum pump. (Refer to
P.17-86.)
Then that the malfunction is eliminated.
