MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-595
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 8. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 11:
Left Bank Heated oxygen sensor (front).
(1) Start the engine and run at idle.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
11, Left Bank Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
• Output voltage should be 0.6 − 1.0 volt when sudden
revving.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
16 PIN
YES : Go to Step 9.
MB991502 NO : Refer to, DTC P0150 − Heated Oxygen Sensor Circuit
AKX01177AB (bank 2, sensor 1) P.13B-184, DTC P0151 − Heated
Oxygen Sensor Circuit Low Voltage (bank 2, sensor
1) P.13B-194, DTC P0152 − Heated Oxygen Sensor
Circuit High Voltage (bank 2, sensor 1) P.13B-199,
DTC P0153 − Heated Oxygen Sensor Circuit Slow
Response (bank 2, sensor 1) P.13B-202, DTC P0154
− Heated Oxygen Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected
(bank 2, sensor 1) P.13B-205.
STEP 9. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 39:
Right Bank Heated oxygen sensor (front).
(1) Start the engine and run at idle.
(2) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
39, Right Bank Heated Oxygen Sensor (front).
• Voltage should fluctuate between 0 − 0.4 volt and 0.6 −
1.0 volt while after the engine has been warmed.
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
16 PIN
YES : Go to Step 10.
MB991502 NO : Go to Step 12.
AKX01177AB
STEP 10. Check the EGR system.
Refer to GROUP 17, Emission Control System − EGR System
Check P.17-106.
Q:Is the EGR system normal?
YES : Go to Step 11.
NO : Repair or replace. Then confirm that the malfunction
symptom is eliminated.
