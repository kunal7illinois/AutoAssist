SIMPLIFIED WIRING SYSTEM (SWS) 54B-141
SYMPTOM PROCEDURES
Q:Is the wiring harness between power window relay
CONNECTOR: C-95 CONNECTOR
connector C-116 (terminal 4) and power window sub
BLOCK (RH)
switch connector E-05 (terminal 7) in good condition?
YES : No action to be taken.
NO : Repair the wiring harness. When the power window
