Q:Is the front passenger’s door lock actuator switch in
good condition?
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Replace the front passenger’s seat door lock actuator
switch. If the functions, which are described in
UNLOCK "CIRCUIT OPERATION", work normally, the input
VIEW A LOCK signal from the front passenger’s door lock actuator
switch should be normal.
