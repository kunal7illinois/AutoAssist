AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
STEP 9. Check the power supply voltage at A/T control
solenoid valve assembly connector B-40.
(1) Disconnect connector B-40 and measure at the harness
CONNECTOR: B-40
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.

(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.5 and 4.9 volts.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 10.
NO : Repair harness open circuit between A/T control

STEP 10. Check the continuity at A/T control solenoid
valve assembly connector B-40.
(1) Disconnect connector B-40 and measure at the harness

(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 2 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.
Q:Is the continuity normal?
YES : Go to Step 11.
NO : Repair harness open circuit or damage between A/T
