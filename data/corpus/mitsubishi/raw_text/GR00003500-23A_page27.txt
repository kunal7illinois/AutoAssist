AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
2. Connect the special tools (3.0 MPa (427 psi) oil pressure
MD998330
gauge [MD998330] and adapters [MD998332, MD998900])
to each pressure discharge port.
NOTE: .
• 2ND: Second brake pressure port
• UD: Underdrive clutch pressure port
MD998900 • LR: Low-reverse brake pressure port
• DR: Torque converter release pressure port
• DA: Torque converter apply pressure port ("DA" pressure

measurements are not needed)
• RV: Reverse clutch pressure port

4. Check that there are no leaks around the special tool port
adapters.
5. Measure the hydraulic pressure at each port under the
MD998332 conditions given in the standard hydraulic pressure table,
and check that the measured values are within the standard
value ranges.

6. If not within the standard value, stop the engine and refer to
<UNDER SIDE VIEW> the Hydraulic pressure test diagnosis table.

8. Remove the special tool, and install the plugs to the
MD998332 hydraulic pressure ports.
9. On completion, start the engine and check that there are no
leaks around the plugs.
