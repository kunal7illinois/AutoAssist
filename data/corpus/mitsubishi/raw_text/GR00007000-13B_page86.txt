DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 21:
Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
21, Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor.
16 PIN • The engine coolant temperature and temperature
shown with the scan tool should approximately match.

Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check connector B-11 at the engine coolant
temperature sensor for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-11 ENGINE
COOLANT YES : Go to Step 3.
TEMPERATURE NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
SENSOR
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 6.
