MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the circuit at ECM connector C-53 <M/T> or
PCM connector C-57 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connectors C-53 <M/T> or C-57 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 45 <M/T> or 83 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground.
C-53 HARNESS • Voltage should be 1 volt or less when the A/C switch is
SIDE CONNECTOR
"OFF".
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage when the A/C
3837363534333231
switch is "ON".

(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.

CAUTION
• When shifting the select lever to D range, the brakes should be applied so that the vehicle does
not move forward.
• Driving tests always need two persons: one driver and one observer.
NOTE: .
*1: If the idle speed is lower than the standard value on a very cold engine [approximately −20°C (−4°F)] even
when the IAC motor is fully opened, the air volume limiter built in the throttle body could be defective.
*2: In a new vehicle [driven approximately 500 km (311 mile) or less], the step of the stepper motor is some-
times 30 steps greater than the standard value.
*3: The injector drive time represents the time when the cranking speed is at 250 r/min or below when the
power supply voltage is 11 volts.
*4: In a new vehicle [driven approximately 500 km (311 mile) or less], the injector drive time is sometimes 10%
longer than the standard time.
*5: In a new vehicle [driven approximately 500 km (311 mile) or less], the volume air flow sensor output fre-
quency is sometimes 10% higher than the standard frequency.
*6: GST items. [Data list items consist of MUT-II items and GST items. GST items can be accessed through
the use of a general scan tool (GST). When MUT-II (MB991502) is used, MUT-II items appear alphabeti-
cally; then, GST items appear alphabetically. The black and white characters of the GST items are
inverted from the MUT-II items.]
