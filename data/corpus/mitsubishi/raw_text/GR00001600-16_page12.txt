NOTE: The voltage waveform of the generator "B" terminal can
undulate as shown at left. This waveform is produced when the
regulator operates according to fluctuations in the generator
load (current), and is normal for the generator. If the ripple
height is abnormally high (approximately 2 V or more during
idling), the wires between the generator B terminal and the bat-
tery have broken due to fuse blowing, etc. The generator is
usually operating properly.

Abnormal Waveforms Examples
NOTE: The size of the waveform patterns can differ greatly, depending on the adjustment of the variable
knob on the oscilloscope.
NOTE: Identification of abnormal waveforms is easier when there is a large output current (regulator is not
operating). (Waveforms can be observed when the headlights are illuminated.)
NOTE: Check the conditions of the charging indicator light (illuminated/not illuminated) also, and carry out a
total check.
