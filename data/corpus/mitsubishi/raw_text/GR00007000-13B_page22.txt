13B-22 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
MALFUNCTION ITEM CONTROL CONTENTS DURING MALFUNCTION
Knock sensor Switches the ignition timing from ignition timing for high octane to ignition timing
for standard octane fuel.
Communication line with No ignition timing retard control (overall engine-transaxle control) achieved
transaxle control CPU when transaxle speeds are changed.
Generator FR terminal Does not restrict the generator output with respect to electrical load.
Heated oxygen sensor Air/fuel ratio closed loop control is not performed.
<front>
Heated oxygen sensor Performs the closed loop control of the air/fuel ratio by using only the signal of
<rear> the heated oxygen sensor (front) installed on the front side of the catalytic
converter.
Misfire detection The ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> stops supplying fuel to the cylinder with the
highest misfiring rate if a misfiring that could damage the catalytic converter is
detected.
