causes for this case:)
If abnormal shock or delay of two seconds or more
• Abnormal underdrive clutch pressure
occurs when the selector lever is shifted from "N" to
• Malfunction of the underdrive solenoid valve
"D" range while the engine is idling, the cause is
• Malfunction of the underdrive clutch
probably abnormal underdrive clutch pressure or a
• Malfunction of the valve body
malfunction of the underdrive clutch, valve body or
• Malfunction of the throttle position sensor
throttle position sensor.
• Malfunction of the PCM

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
.
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, carry out the actuator
test item 02: Underdrive Solenoid Valve.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to actuator test mode for item 02:
Underdrive Solenoid Valve.
• An operation sound should be heard from solenoid
valve when solenoid valve is operated.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
16 PIN Q:Is the solenoid valve operating properly?
YES : Go to Step 2.
MB991502
AC001252AB NO : Repair or replace the underdrive solenoid valve.
Refer to GROUP 23B, Valve Body P.23B-74. Then
confirm that the symptom is eliminated.
STEP 2. Check when shock occurs.
Q:When does the shock occur?
When engaging from N to D : Go to Step 3.
When the vehicle starts moving : Go to Step 6.
STEP 3. Check the hydraulic pressure (for underdrive
clutch).
Measure the hydraulic pressure for underdrive clutch when the
selector lever is shifted from "N" to "D" range. Check if the
hydraulic pressure is within the standard value. Refer to P.23A-
26, Hydraulic Pressure Test.
Q:Is the hydraulic pressure within the standard value?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Go to Step 8.
