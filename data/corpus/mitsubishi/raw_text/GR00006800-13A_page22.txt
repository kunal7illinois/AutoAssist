13A-22 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
MALFUNCTION ITEM CONTROL CONTENTS DURING MALFUNCTION
Heated oxygen sensor Air/fuel ratio closed loop control is not performed.
<front>
Heated oxygen sensor Performs the closed loop control of the air/fuel ratio by using only the signal of
<rear> the heated oxygen sensor (front) installed on the front side of the catalytic
converter.
Generator FR terminal No generator output suppression control is performed for the electrical load (to
be operated as an ordinary generator).
Misfire detection The ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> stops supplying fuel to the cylinder with the
highest misfiring rate if a misfiring that could damage the catalytic converter is
detected.
