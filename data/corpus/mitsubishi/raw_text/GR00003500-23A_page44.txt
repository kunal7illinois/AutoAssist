(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 78 and ground by
backprobing.
• With the throttle valve in idle position, voltage should be
between 0.535 and 0.735 volts.
• With the throttle valve in full-open position, voltage
should be between 4.5 and 5.5 volts.
C-57 <2.4L ENGINE> OR (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
