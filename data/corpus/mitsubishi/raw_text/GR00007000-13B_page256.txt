13B-256 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 8. Check the fuel pressure.
Refer to Fuel Pressure Test P.13B-680.
Q:Is the fuel pressure normal?
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Repair or replace it. Then go to Step 10.
STEP 9. Replace the right bank injector.
(1) Replace the right bank injector.
CONNECTORS : B-01, B-05, B-26
(2) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to
Procedure 2 − Fuel Trim Monitor P.13B-6.
B-05 B-26 (3) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0172 is output?
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 10.
