AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
STEP 10. Check auto-cruise control vacuum pump
connector A-01.
Q:Is the connector damaged?
CONNECTOR: A-01
YES : Repair or replace connector.
RESERVE Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection
TANK
P.00E-2.
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 14 is not
output.
NO : Go to Step 11.

STEP 11. Check the auto-cruise vacuum pump.
(1) Disconnect the vacuum hose from the auto-cruise vacuum
pump and connect a vacuum gauge to the vacuum pump.
(2) Disconnect the vacuum pump connector.
(3) Check the auto-cruise vacuum pump and valves according
VACUUM to the following procedure:
GAUGE • Connect the positive battery terminal to auto-cruise vac-
uum pump connector terminal 1, and the negative bat-
tery terminal to terminals 2, 3, and 4.
The vacuum gauge should read 27 kPa (8.0 in Hg) or
more.
• The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.
Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 2 is disconnected from the negative bat-
tery terminal while terminals 1, and 3 remain connected.
• The vacuum should be maintained when terminal 4 is
disconnected from the negative battery terminal while
terminals 1, 2, and 3 remain connected.
CONTROL RELEASE
VALVE VALVE Then the vacuum gauge should read 0 kPa (0 in Hg)
when terminal 3 is disconnected from the negative bat-
tery terminal while terminals 1, and 2 remain connected.
Q:Are all of the above values satisfied?
ACX01181AB
YES : Go to Step 12.
NO : Replace the auto-cruise vacuum pump. (Refer to
P.17-86.)
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 14 is not
output.
