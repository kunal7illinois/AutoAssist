13B-286 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the injector resistance at injector
intermediate connector B-48.
(1) Disconnect the injector intermediate connector B-48.
CONNECTOR:B-48
AK000209AC
(2) Measure the resistance between each male connector side
INJECTOR terminal.
INTERMEDIATE
CONNECTOR a. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 2 when
measuring No. 1 cylinder.
b. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 3 when
1 2 measuring No. 3 cylinder.
3 4 c. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 4 when
measuring No. 5 cylinder.
• Resistance should be between 13 and 16 ohm.
AK000240AB Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Go to Step 4.
STEP 4. Check the connector at injector for damage.
(1) Remove the intake manifold.
CONNECTORS : B-01, B-05, B-26
a. Check the connector B-01 when checking No. 1 cylin-
der.
B-05 B-26 b. Check the connector B-05 when checking No. 3 cylin-
der.
c. Check the connector B-26 when checking No. 5 cylin-
der.
B-01 Q:Is the harness connector in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 5.
AK000210AB NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.
