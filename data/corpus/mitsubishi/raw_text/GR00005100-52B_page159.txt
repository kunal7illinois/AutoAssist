SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) 52B-159
AIR BAG MODULE DISPOSAL PROCEDURES
WARNING
• Before deploying the air bag in this manner, first
check to be sure that there is no one in or near the
vehicle. Wear safety glasses.
• The inflator will be quite hot immediately following
the deployment, so wait at least 30 minutes to
allow it to cool before attempting to handle it.
Although not poisonous, do not inhale gas from
the air bag deployment. See Deployed Air Bag
Module Disposal Procedures (Refer to P.52B-167.)
for post-deployment handling instructions.
• If the air bag module fails to deploy, do not go near
the module. Contact the MMSA Tech Line.
8. At a location as far away from the vehicle as possible,
disconnect the two connected wires from each other, and
connect them to the two terminals of the battery (which has
been removed from the vehicle) to deploy the air bag.
9. After deployment, dispose of the air bag module according
to the Deployed Air Bag Module Disposal Procedures.
(Refer to P.52B-167.)
