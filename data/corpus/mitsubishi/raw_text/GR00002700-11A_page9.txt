ON VEHICLE SERVICE
9. If there is a cylinder with compression or a compression
difference that is outside the limit, pour a small amount of
engine oil through the spark plug hole, and repeat the
operations in steps 6 to 8.
(1) If the compression increases after oil is added, the cause
of the malfunction is a worn or damaged piston ring and/
or cylinder inner surface.
(2) If the compression does not rise after oil is added, the
cause is a burnt or defective valve seat, or pressure is
leaking from the gasket.
10.Connect the crankshaft position sensor connector.
11.Install the spark plugs and spark plug cables.
12.Use the scan tool to erase the diagnostic trouble codes.
NOTE: This will erase the diagnostic trouble code resulting
from the crankshaft position sensor connector being discon-
nected.

1. Start the engine and allow it to warm up until the
temperature of the engine coolant reaches 80 − 95°C (176 −
VACUUM GAUGE 203°F).
2. Connect a tachometer.
3. Attach a tee-fitting union to the vacuum hose between the
fuel pressure regulator and the intake manifold plenum, and
connect a vacuum gauge.
4. Start the engine and check that idle speed is within
specification. Then check the vacuum gauge reading.
