MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-423
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Using scan tool MB991502, check data list item 95:
Manifold Differential Pressure Sensor.
CAUTION
To prevent damage to scan tool MB991502, always turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position before con-
necting or disconnecting scan tool MB991502.
(1) Connect scan tool MB991502 to the data link connector.
(2) Start the engine and run at idle.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to the data reading mode for item
95, Manifold Differential Pressure Sensor.
16 PIN • While engine is idling, pressure should be between 62
and 76 kPa.

Q:Is the sensor operating properly?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
NO : Go to Step 2.
STEP 2. Check connector B-04 at manifold differential
pressure sensor for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR:B-04
YES : Go to Step 3.
MANIFOLD
DIFFERENTIAL NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PRESSURE
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 12.

STEP 3. Check the sensor supply voltage at manifold
differential pressure sensor harness side connector B-04.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-04 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
• Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts.
