MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-351
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Using scan tool MB991502, check solenoid for
clogging of the purge control.
(1) Disconnect hoses A and B from the evaporative emission
THROTTLE
BODY purge solenoid side, and connect the hand vacuum pump to
HOSE A the evaporative emission purge solenoid instead of hose B.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Set scan tool MB991502 to actuator test mode for item 08:
Evaporative Emission Purge Solenoid. When the
evaporative emission purge solenoid is operated, apply a
HOSE B
pressure on the hand vacuum pump and confirm that air is
blown from the other side nipple.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position. Then
AC000223AG
disconnect scan tool MB991502.
EVAPORATIVE EMISSION (5) Disconnect the hand vacuum pump, and connect hoses A
PURGE SOLENOID
and B to the evaporative emission purge solenoid.
Q:Is the solenoid in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the evaporative emission purge solenoid.
Then go to Step 27.

STEP 3. Check for leaks and clogging in the evaporator
line hose A to hose C.
Q:Are the hoses in good condition?
THROTTLE
BODY YES : Go to Step 4.
HOSE A NO : Replace the inferior hose. Then go to Step 27.
HOSE B
HOSE C
AC000223AE
STEP 4. Check for leaks and clogging in the chamber.
(1) When you blow the chamber, it should pass less air.
THROTTLE
BODY (2) When you blow the chamber, on air should leak from the
chamber body.
Q:Is the chamber in good condition?
CHAMBER
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Replace the chamber. Then go to Step 27.
