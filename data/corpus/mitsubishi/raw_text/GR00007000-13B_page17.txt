CATALYTIC CONVERTER MONITOR
DTC P0421, P0431
Drive cycle This monitor [from start to ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position] will be completed
pattern while traveling with the following drive cycle pattern. It will take 20 minutes. You must
complete this drive twice.
NOTE: . Vehicle speed and throttle opening angle should be within the shaded range.

Inspection • Atmospheric temperature: −10°C (14°F) or more
conditions • A/C switch: OFF
• Condition of A/T: Selector lever D range
Test 1.Engine: start
procedure 2.Accelerate until the vehicle speed is 72 km/h (45 mph).
3.Travel for 300 seconds or more while keeping the vehicle speed at 72 − 97 km/h (45 - 60
mph). (M/T = 5ht speed)
4.Decelerate until the vehicle speed is within 56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40 mph).
5.While keeping the accelerator pedal opening degree constant, keep the vehicle speed at
56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40 mph) and travel for 90 seconds or more. (During monitor)
6.Fully close the throttle and decelerate, and keep the deceleration state for 10 seconds.
Then, quickly accelerate until the vehicle speed reaches 56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40 mph).
Then, repeat steps 5 and 6, and complete six monitoring sessions.
7.Return the vehicle to the shop, then turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
8.Confirm that the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is not output.
9.9. If DTC P0421 is output, refer to DTC P0421 − Warm Up Catalyst Efficiency Below
Threshold (Bank 1) P.13B-346.
If DTC P0431 is output, refer to DTC P0431 − Warm Up Catalyst Efficiency Below
Threshold (Bank 2) P.13B-348.
