13A-10 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
MODE 6 REFERENCE TABLE
The engine control module (ECM) <M/T> or powertrain control module (PCM) <A/T> monitors the condition
of emission control system.
By selecting MODE 6 using scan tool, Test Result and Limit Value (minimum) *1 or (maximum) *2 about the
main items of emission control system which ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> monitors can be confirmed. The
value at the last monitoring is output by ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> as a test result.

GENERAL SCAN
TOOL
01 Catalyst ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> Catalyst Frequency × 0.0039
monitor monitors the deterioration of Ratio
catalyst by the output frequency Test Result and Limit
ratio between heated oxygen Value (max.)
sensor (front) and heated oxygen
sensor (rear).
03 EGR monitor ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EGR Monitor Pressure × 0.43 kPa
monitors the operation of EGR Value
system by the pressure difference Test Result and Limit
of intake manifold between before Value (min.) kPa
and after introduction of EGR using
the manifold differential pressure
sensor.
06 Evaporation ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EVAP Leak Mon. 1 mm × 0.032 kPa
leak monitor monitors the leak of fuel Pressure Value
(Small leak) evaporation gas by the reduction of Test Result and Limit
vacuum in tank after appointed time Value (max.) kPa
using the fuel tank differential
pressure sensor after making the
fuel tank and the fuel line vacuum.
07 Evaporation ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> EVAP Leak Mon. Gross × 0.032 kPa
leak monitor monitors the leak of fuel Pressure Value
(Gross leak) evaporation gas by the reduction of Test Result and Limit
vacuum in tank after appointed time Value (min.) kPa
using the fuel tank differential
pressure sensor after making the
fuel tank and the fuel line vacuum.
