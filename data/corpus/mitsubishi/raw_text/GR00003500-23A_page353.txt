A/T FLUID TEMPERATURE SENSOR CONTINUITY
CHECK
M1231004500139
1. Remove the A/T fluid temperature sensor.
2. Measure the resistance between terminals 1 and 2 of the A/
T fluid temperature sensor connector.
Standard value:
A/T FLUID TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE
0°C (32°F) 16.7 − 20.5 kΩ
20°C (68°F) 7.3 − 8.9 kΩ
ATF 40°C (104°F) 3.4 − 4.2 kΩ
AC101016AB 60°C (140°F) 1.9 − 2.2 kΩ
80°C (176°F) 1.0 − 1.2 kΩ
100°C (212°F) 0.57 − 0.69 kΩ
3. If the A/T fluid temperature sensor resistance is not
consistent with the fluid temperature, replace A/T fluid
temperature sensor.
NOTE: The N range indicator light on the combination meter
flashes when the temperature reaches approximately 125°C
(257°F) or higher, and then stops flashing when the temper-
ature drops below approximately 115°C (239°F).
