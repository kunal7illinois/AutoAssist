ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL 17-35
AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
STEP 6. Check the output circuit voltage at auto-cruise
control switch connector C-82 (terminal numbers 2 and 3)
by backprobing.
(1) Do not disconnect auto-cruise control switch connector C-
207.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 2 and ground by
C-82 CONNECTOR backprobing.
HARNESS SIDE VIEW • Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(MAIN switch is at the "ON" position.)
1 2 3 (4) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground by
backprobing.
• Voltage should be between 6.8 and 7.2 volts.
(MAIN switch is at the "ON" position.)
• Voltage should be between 3.5 and 5.0 volts.
(All switches are at the "OFF" position.)
ACX01913AE
• Voltage should be between 0.4 and 2.3 volts.
("SET" switch is at the "ON" position)
• Voltage should be between 2.3 and 3.5 volts.
("RESUME" switch is at the "ON" position.)
• Voltage should be between 1 volt or less.
("CANCEL" switch is at the "ON" position.)
(5) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage within specifications?
YES : Go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 7.
STEP 7. Check auto-cruise control switch connector C-82.
Q:Is the connector damaged?
CONNECTORS: C-82
YES : Repair or replace connector.
CLOCK SPRING Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection
P.00E-2.
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 15 is not
output.
NO : Go to Step 8.
