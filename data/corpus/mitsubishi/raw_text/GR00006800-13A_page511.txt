MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-511
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the backup power supply voltage at ECM
harness side connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM harness side
connector C-54 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-60 <M/T> or C-54 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Measure the voltage between terminal 80 <M/T> or 66 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 7.

9291908988878685848382 NO : Check harness connector C-07 at intermediate
connector for damage, and repair or replace as
C-60 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR required. Refer to, GROUP 00E, Harness Connector
Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate connectors are in
AK000403AC good condition, repair harness wire between relay
box (9) and ECM connector C-60 (terminal 80) <M/T>
<A/T>
or PCM connector C-54 (terminal 66) <A/T> because
C-54 HARNESS of open circuit. Then confirm that the malfunction
SIDE CONNECTOR symptom is eliminated.
