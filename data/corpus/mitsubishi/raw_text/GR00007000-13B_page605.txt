DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check connector C-51 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-52 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T>
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness

Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.

STEP 2. Check the output voltage at ECM harness side
connector C-51 <M/T> or PCM harness side connector C-
52 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-51 <M/T> or C-52 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 18 and ground.
C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T> • Voltage should be between 4.8 and 5.2 volts. (Fan

Q:Is the voltage and fan condition normal?
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
NO : Go to Step 3.
