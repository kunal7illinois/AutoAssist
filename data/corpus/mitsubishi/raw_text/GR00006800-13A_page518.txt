STEP 3. Check the fuel pump relay 1 and 2.
(1) Remove the fuel pump relay.
(2) Check for continuity between the fuel pump relay terminals
2 and 3.
• There should be continuity. (approximately 70 Ω)
(3) Use jumper wires to connect fuel pump relay terminal 3 to
the positive battery terminal and terminal 2 to the negative
battery terminal.
(4) Check the continuity between the fuel pump relay terminals
1 and 4 while connecting and disconnecting the jumper wire
at the negative battery terminal.
• Should be less than 2 ohm. (Negative battery terminal
connected)
• Should be open loop. (Negative battery terminal discon-
nected)
(5) Install the fuel pump relay.
Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 4.
NO : Replace the fuel pump relay. Then confirm that the
