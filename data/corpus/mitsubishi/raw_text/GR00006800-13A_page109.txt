MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-109
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check for open circuit and short circuit to ground
between throttle position sensor connector B-07 (terminal
3) and ECM connector C-60 (terminal 81) <M/T> or PCM
connector C-54 (terminal 46) <A/T>.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-07
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 11.
NO : Repair it. Then go to Step 11.

(2) Measure the resistance between throttle position sensor
side connector terminal 1 and 4.

(3) Measure resistance between the throttle position sensor
1 2 3 4 side connector terminal 1 and 3.
(4) Move the throttle valve from the idle position to the full-open
position.
• Resistance should change smoothly in proportion to the
opening angle of the throttle valve.
AK000320AB Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Replace the throttle position sensor. Refer to P.13A-
593, Throttle Body. Then go to Step 11.
