13A-188 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 11. Check the trouble symptoms.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to,
Procedure 6 − Other Monitor P.13A-5.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0141 is output?
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 12.
NO : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
STEP 12. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to,
Procedure 6 − Other Monitor P.13A-5.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0141 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
