CHASSIS ELECTRICAL 54A-101
COMBINATION METERS ASSEMBLY AND VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR
STEP 5. Check the engine coolant temperature gauge unit.
(1) Drain the engine coolant. (Refer to GROUP 00,
Maintenance Service − Engine Coolant P.00-56.)
(2) Remove the engine coolant temperature gauge unit.
(3) Immerse the unit in 70°C (158° F) water to measure the
resistance.
Q:Is the resistance 104 ± 13.5 ohms?
YES : Repair or replace the combination meter (printed-
circuit board or engine coolant temperature gauge
assembly). The engine coolant temperature gauge
should work normally.
NO : Replace the engine coolant temperature gauge unit.
The engine coolant temperature gauge should work
ACX01789AB
normally.
