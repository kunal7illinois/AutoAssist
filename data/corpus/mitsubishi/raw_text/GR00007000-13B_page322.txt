13B-322 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 11. Check the power supply voltage at crankshaft
position sensor harness side connector B-20.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-20 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
B-20 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
2 1 Q:Is the voltage normal?
3 YES : Go to Step 13.
NO : Go to Step 12.

STEP 12. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Repair harness wire between MFI relay connector A-
MFI RELAY 18X terminal 4 and crankshaft position sensor
connector B-20 terminal 3 because of open circuit or
short circuit to ground. Then go to Step 21.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then go to Step 21.

STEP 13. Check the continuity at crankshaft position
sensor harness side connector B-20.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-20 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 1 and ground.
• Should be less than 2 ohm.

SIDE CONNECTOR Q:Is the continuity normal?
2 1 YES : Go to Step 16.
3 NO : Go to Step 14.
