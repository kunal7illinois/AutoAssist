35B-34 ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS)
ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2 Check the ABS warning light bulb.
(1) Remove the combination meter (Refer to GROUP 54A,
Combination Meter P.54A-105 and P.54A-107.)
(2) Check the ABS warning light bulb.
Q:Is the bulb burned out?
YES : Replace the bulb and then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 3.
STEP 3. Check the combination meter for continuity.
(1) Remove the combination meter.
(2) Remove the ABS warning light bulb. Then measure the
resistance between the bulb terminals.
(3) Install the ABS warning light bulb to the combination meter,
and then measure the resistance between connector C-41
CONNECTOR C-41
terminal 52 and connector C-42 terminal 24. The resistance
reading at this time should be much the same as the
resistance measured at step (2).
Q:Are the two resistance values extremely different each
other?
CONNECTOR C-42 YES : Replace the combination meter (printed circuit board)
and then go to Step 9.
AC004480AB NO : Go to Step 4.
STEP 4. Check the combination meter power supply
circuit.
(1) Disconnect connector C-41, and check at the harness side.
CONNECTOR: C-41
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
COMBINATION METER
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 52 and ground. It
HARNESS SIDE
should be approximately 12 volts (battery positive voltage).
Q:Is the voltage approximately 12 volts (battery positive
voltage)?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Go to Step 7.
