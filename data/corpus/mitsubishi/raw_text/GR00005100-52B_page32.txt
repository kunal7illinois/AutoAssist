52B-32 SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS)
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
CIRCUIT OPERATION TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• The SRS-ECU judges how severe a collision is • Open circuit in the clock spring
by detecting signals from the front air bag analog • Open circuit due to improper neutral position of
G-sensor. If the impact is over a predetermined the clock spring
level, the SRS-ECU outputs an ignition signal. At • Open circuit in the driver’s air bag module (squib)
this time, if the front air bag safing G-sensor is on, circuit
the SRS air bag will inflate. • Disengaged driver’s air bag module (squib) con-
• The ignition signal is input to the air bag module nector
via the clock spring to inflate the air bag. • Improper connector contact
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
DTC SET CONDITIONS
• These DTC are output if there is abnormal resis-
tance between the input terminals of the driver’s
side air bag module (squib). The most likely
causes for this code to be set are shown in the
table below: However, if no DTC resets, the SRS
warning light will be switched off (DTC will be
retained).

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
• MB991613: SRS Check Harness
• MB991865: Dummy resister
• MB991866 Resister harness
STEP 1. Check the driver’s air bag module.
(1) Disconnect the negative battery terminal.
(2) Remove the driver(cid:146)s air bag module. (Refer to P.52B-144.)
(3) Connect connector (4) of special tool MB991613 to clock
spring connector C-81.special tool MB991613 to special
MB991613 tool MB991866.
(4) Connect connector (1) of special tool MB991613 to
RESISTANCE (3Ω) connector (2).
(5) Connect terminals 22 to 24, and terminals 23 to 25 of

(8) Erase the DTC memory, and then recheck the DTC.
Q: Is DTC 22 out put?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Replace the driver(cid:146)s air bag module. Then go to Step
CLOCK SPRING 4.
