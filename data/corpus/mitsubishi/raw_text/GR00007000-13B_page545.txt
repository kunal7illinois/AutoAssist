MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-545
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 8. Check the right bank injector resistance at injector
intermediate connector B-48.
(1) Disconnect the injector intermediate connector B-48.
(2) Measure the resistance between each male connector side
CONNECTOR:B-48
terminal.
a. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 2 when
measuring No. 1 cylinder injector.
b. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 3 when
measuring No. 3 cylinder injector.
c. Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 4 when
measuring No. 5 cylinder injector.
• Resistance should be between 13 and 16 ohm [at 20°C
(68°F)].

STEP 9. Check the right bank injector.
(1) Remove the intake manifold.
CONNECTORS : B-01, B-05, B-26
(2) Disconnect the right bank injector connector, which
deviates from the standard value at Step 8.

(3) Measure the resistance between injector side connector
INJECTOR SIDE terminal 1 and 2.
CONNECTOR Standard value: 13 − 16 ohm [at 20°C (68°F)]
Q:Is the resistance standard value?

YES : Go to Step 10.
NO : Replace the injector. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
