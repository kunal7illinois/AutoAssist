MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L> 13B-269
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 4. Check the continuity at fuel temperature sensor
harness side connector D-17.
(1) Disconnect the connector D-17 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 1 and ground.
D-17 HARNESS • Should be less than 2 ohm.
SIDE CONNECTOR
Q:Is the continuity normal?

55 44 YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Repair harness wire between fuel temperature sensor
connector D-17 terminal 1 and ground because of
open circuit or harness damage. Then go to Step 12.

STEP 5. Check the sensor supply voltage at fuel
temperature sensor harness side connector D-17.
(1) Disconnect the connector D-17 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 3 and ground.
D-17 HARNESS • Voltage should be between 4.5 and 4.9 volts
SIDE CONNECTOR
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
