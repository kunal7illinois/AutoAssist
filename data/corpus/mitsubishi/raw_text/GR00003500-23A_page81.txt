AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE DIAGNOSIS
STEP 6. Check the A/T fluid temperature sensor at A/T
control solenoid valve assembly connector B-40.
(1) Disconnect connector B-40 and measure at the sensor
CONNECTOR: B-40
side.

(2) Measure the resistance between terminal 1 and 2.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 0°C (32°F), resistance
should be between 16.7 and 20.5 kiloohm.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 20°C (68°F), resistance
should be between 7.3 and 8.9 kiloohm.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 40°C (104°F), resistance
should be between 3.4 and 4.2 kiloohm.
HARNESS • When A/T fluid temperature is 60°C (140°F), resistance
CONNECTOR: B-40
should be between 1.9 and 2.2 kiloohm.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 80°C (176°F), resistance
ACX02103AD
should be between 1.0 and 1.2 kiloohm.
• When A/T fluid temperature is 100°C (212°F), resis-
tance should be between 0.57 and 0.69 kiloohm.
Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Replace the A/T fluid temperature sensor. Refer to
GROUP 23B, Transaxle P.23B-10.
