13A-228 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
• The throttle deviation is −0.059 volt/10ms to • Misfire has occurred in 20 or more of the last
+0.059 volt/10ms. 1,000 revolutions (corresponding to 1.5 times the
limit of emission standard).
Judgement Criteria (change in the angular accel-
eration of the crankshaft is used for misfire

TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely
detection).
• Misfire has occurred more frequently than causes for this code to be set are: )
• Ignition system related part(s) failed.
allowed during the last 200 revolutions [when the
catalyst temperature is higher than 950°C • Low compression pressure.
(1,742°F)]. • Injector failed.
• ECM failed. <M/T>
or
• PCM failed. <A/T>
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check the spark plugs.
(1) Check that the plug is not burned, that the insulator plug is
not damaged, and that the seizure state is good.
(2) If cleaning is required due to carbon deposits, etc., clean
using a plug cleaner or wire brush, etc.
(3) Check the plug gap using a plug gap gauge, and adjust if
PLUG GAP
not within the standard value.
GAUGE
Standard value: 1.0 − 1.1 mm (0.039 − 0.043 inch)
Q:Is the spark plug in good condition?
YES : Go to Step 2.
MEASU- NO : Replace the spark plug. Then go to Step 9.

STEP 2. Check the spark plug cable.
(1) Check the cap and coating for cracks.
(2) Measure the resistance.
Limit: maximum 19 kΩ
Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Replace the spark plug cable. Then go to Step 9.
