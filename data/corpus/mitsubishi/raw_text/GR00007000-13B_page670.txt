13B-670 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
CONDITION OF WAVE PROBABLE CAUSE
PATTERN BUILD-UP
SECTION AND MAXIMUM
VOLTAGE
Rises from approximate 2 Normal
volts to approximate 4.5 volts
at the top-right
2-volt rectangular wave Open-circuit in ignition primary
circuit
Rectangular wave at power Ignition power transistor

.
Examples of Abnormal Wave Patterns
Example 1 (Wave pattern during engine cranking)
• Cause of problem
NORMAL WAVE
Open-circuit in ignition primary circuit
PATTERN
• Wave pattern characteristics
Top-right part of the build-up section cannot be seen, and
voltage value is approximately 2 volts too low.

Example 2 (Wave pattern during engine cranking)
NORMAL WAVE • Cause of problem
PATTERN
BATTERY Malfunction in ignition power transistor
POSITION • Wave pattern characteristics
VOLTAGE
Power voltage results when the ignition power transistor is
ON.
