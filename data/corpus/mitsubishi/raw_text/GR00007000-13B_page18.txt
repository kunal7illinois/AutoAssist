Inspection • Engine coolant temperature: 80°C (176°F) or more
conditions • Atmospheric temperature: −10°C (14°F) or more
• Condition of A/T: Selector lever D range
Test Engine: start
procedure Accelerate until the vehicle speed is 56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40 mph).
While keeping the accelerator pedal opening degree constant (M/T = 4th speed), keep the
vehicle speed at 56 − 64 km/h (35 − 40 mph) and travel for 120 seconds or more. (During
monitor)
Return the vehicle to the shop, then turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
