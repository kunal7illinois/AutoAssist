CIRCUIT OPERATION DTC SET CONDITIONS
• The SRS-ECU judges how severe a collision is • This DTC is set if there is abnormal resistance
by detecting signals from the front air bag analog between the input terminals of the passenger’s
G-sensor. If the impact is over a predetermined air bag module (squib). However, if no DTC
level, the SRS-ECU outputs an ignition signal. At resets, the SRS warning light will be switched off
this time, if the front air bag safing G-sensor is on, (DTC will be retained).
the SRS air bag will inflate.
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• The ignition signal is input to the air bag module
• Damaged harness wires and connectors
via the clock spring to inflate the air bag.
• Short to the ground in the passenger’s air bag
module (squib) harness
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
