Wave Pattern Observation Points
Check that cycle time T becomes shorter and the frequency
increases when the engine speed is increased.
.
Examples of Abnormal Wave Patterns
Example 1
Cause of problem
• Sensor interface malfunction.
Wave pattern characteristics
• Rectangular wave pattern is output even when the
engine is not started.
AKX01597
Example 2
Cause of problem
• Damaged rectifier or vortex generation column.
Wave pattern characteristics
• Unstable wave pattern with non-uniform frequency. An
ignition leak will distort the wave pattern temporarily,
even if the volume air flow sensor is normal.
