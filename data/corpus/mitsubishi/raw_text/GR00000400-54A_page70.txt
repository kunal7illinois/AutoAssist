COMBINATION METERS ASSEMBLY AND VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR
STEP 37. Check connectors C-50, C-61 <2.4L> or C-52, C-
63 <3.0L> at PCM and B-38 at output shaft speed sensor
for damage.
Q:Are the connectors in good condition?
CONNECTORS: C-50, C-61 <2.4L-A/T>,
C-52, C-63 <3.0L-A/T> YES : Go to Step 38.
NO : Repair or replace the connector. Refer to GROUP
00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-2. The
PCM
speedometer should work normally.
C-50 <2.4L-A/T> C-61 <2.4L-A/T>
C-52 <3.0L-A/T> C-63 <3.0L-A/T>

STEP 38. Check the continuity at output shaft speed
sensor connector B-38.
(1) Disconnect connector B-38 and measure at the harness
CONNECTOR: B-38
side.

(2) Check for the continuity between terminal 1 and ground.
HARNESS • The measured value should be 2 ohm or less.
CONNECTOR: B-38
Q:Does the measured resistance value correspond with
this range?
YES : Go to Step 39.
NO : Go to Step 41.
