DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
STEP 1. Check the exhaust leaks.
Q:Are there any abnormalities?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Repair it. Then go to Step 14.
STEP 2. Check the intake system vacuum leak.
Q:Are there any abnormalities?
YES : Go to Step 3.
NO : Repair it. Then go to Step 14.
