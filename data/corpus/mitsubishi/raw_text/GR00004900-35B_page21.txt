ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) 35B-21
ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the stoplight switch circuit at the ABS-ECU
connector A-02.
(1) Disconnect the ABS-ECU connector A-02 and measure at
the harness side.
(2) Press the brake pedal. (The stoplight switch is turned to
ON.)
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 14 and ground.
A-02 (HARNESS SIDE)
Q:Is the voltage approximately 12 volts (battery positive
voltage)?
YES : Replace the hydraulic unit (integrated with ABS-ECU)
and then go to Step 7.
NO : Go to Step 5.

STEP 4. Check the stoplight switch continuity.
(1) Remove the stoplight switch. (Refer to GROUP 35A, Brake
Pedal P.35A-31.)
(2) Connect an ohmmeter to the stoplight switch terminals 1
and 2, and check whether there is continuity when the
plunger of the stoplight switch is pushed in and when it is
released.

(3) The stoplight switch is in good condition if there is no
continuity when the plunger is pushed in to a depth of within
NO CONTINUITY CONTINUITY
4 mm (0.2 inch) from the outer case edge surface, and if
(OFF) (ON)
there is continuity when it is released.
Q:Is the stoplight switch damaged?
YES : Replace it and then go to Step 7.
NO : Go to Step 6.
