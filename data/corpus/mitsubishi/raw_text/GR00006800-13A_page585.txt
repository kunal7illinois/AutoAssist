3. Turn the ignition switch "ON" position.
4. Slowly move the throttle lever from the idle position to the
full-throttle position and check then if the waveform is free

1. Using the scan tool MB991502, observe HO S reading. If
HEATED 2
OXYGEN values are unsatisfactory, or if Scan tool is not available, use
SENSOR the following procedure:
EQUIPMENT
RED (1) Disconnect the heated oxygen sensor connector and
SIDE
connect special tool MD998464 to the connector on the
CONNECTOR
heated oxygen sensor side.
BLUE
(2) Make sure that there is continuity [4.5 − 8.0 Ω at 20°C
(68°F)] between terminal 1 (red clip of special tool) and
terminal 3 (blue clip of special tool) on the heated oxygen
AKX01624AC
MD998464 sensor connector
(3) If there is no continuity, replace the heated oxygen
sensor.
JUMPER
WIRES (4) Warm up the engine until engine coolant is 80°C (176°F)
or higher.

RED
CAUTION
Be very careful when connecting the jumper wires; incor-
rect connection can damage the heated oxygen sensor.
BLUE
WHITE (5) Use the jumper wires to connect terminal 1 (red clip) of
the heated oxygen sensor connector to the positive
MD998464 battery terminal and terminal 3 (blue clip) to the negative
AKX01625AC
battery terminal.
(6) Connect a digital voltage meter between terminal 2 (black
clip) and terminal 4 (white clip).
