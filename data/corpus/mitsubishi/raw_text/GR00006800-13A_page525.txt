MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L> 13A-525
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 14. Check the power supply voltage at ECM
connector C-49 <M/T> or PCM connector C-50 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-49 <M/T> or C-50 <A/T> and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 22 <M/T> or 21 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
(4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
