GEAR BOX TOTAL PINION TORQUE CHECK
CAUTION
When holding the steering gear box assembly in a vice,
secure its mounting positions. If it is secured in any other
places, the gear housing may become deformed or dam-
aged.
Using special tool MB990228 or MB991006, rotate the pinion
MB990228
gear at the rate of one rotation in approximately 4 to 6 seconds
OR
to check the total pinion torque.
MB991006
Standard value: 0.8 − 1.9 N⋅m (6.9 − 16.5 in-lb)
[Change in torque: 0.7 N⋅m (6.1 in-lb) or less]
NOTE: When measuring, remove the bellows from the rack
housing. Measure the pinion torque through the whole stroke of
the rack.
If the measured value is not within the standard range, first
AC000996AB adjust the rack support cover, and then check the total pinion
torque again.
If the total pinion torque cannot be adjusted to within the stan-
dard range by adjusting the rack support cover, check the rack
support cover, rack support spring, rack support and replace
any parts if necessary.
