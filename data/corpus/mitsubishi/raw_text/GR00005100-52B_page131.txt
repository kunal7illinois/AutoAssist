CIRCUIT OPERATION TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION (COMMENT)
• The SRS-ECU is powered from the ignition • If communication is not possible with the SRS
switch (IG1). only, the cause is probably an open circuit in the
• The SRS-ECU power is supplied from two cir- on-board diagnostic output circuit of the SRS or
cuits. Even if one circuit is shut off, the air bag in the power circuit (including ground circuit).
can inflate.
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• The SRS system diagnosis can be done by con-
• Damaged wiring harnesses or connectors
necting scan tool MB991502 to the data link con-
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
nector.
• Incorrect scan tool (MUT-II) ROM pack
• The SRS-ECU judges how severe a collision is
by detecting signals from the left and right side
impact sensors and the analog G-sensor. If the
impact is over a predetermined level, the SRS-
ECU outputs an ignition signal. At this time, if the
safing G-sensor is on, the SRS air bag will inflate.

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991223 (MB991222): Harness set (Probe)
STEP 1. Check that the scan tool can communicate with
the other systems.
Q:Can the scan tool communicate with the other systems?
YES : Go to Step 2.
NO : Refer to GROUP 13A, Diagnosis P.13A-434 GROUP
13B, Diagnosis P.13B-530.
