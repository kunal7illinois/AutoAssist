ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) 35B-47
ON-VEHICLE SERVICE
POINTS IN WAVEFORM MEASUREMENT
SYMPTOM PROBABLE CAUSES REMEDY
Too small or zero waveform amplitude Faulty wheel speed sensor Replace sensor
Incorrect pole piece-to-ABS rotor Adjust clearance
clearance
Waveform amplitude fluctuates Axle hub eccentric or with large Replace hub
excessively (This is no problem if the runout
minimum amplitude is 100 mV or
more)
Noisy or disturbed waveform Open circuit in wheel speed sensor Replace sensor
Open circuit in harness Repair harness
Incorrectly mounted wheel speed Mount correctly
sensor
ABS rotor with missing or damaged Replace ABS rotor
teeth
NOTE: The wheel speed sensor cable moves in relation to motion of the front or rear suspension. Therefore,
it is likely that it has an open circuit only when driving on rough roads but it functions normally when driving on
smooth roads. It is recommended to observe sensor output voltage waveform also under special conditions,
such as driving on a rough road.
HYDRAULIC UNIT CHECK
M1352001700233
Required Special Tool:
MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
CAUTION
• The roller of the braking force tester and the tire should
be dry during testing.
• When testing the front brakes, apply the parking brake.
When testing the rear brakes, stop the front wheels
with chocks.
1. Jack up the vehicle. Then support the vehicle with rigid
racks at the specified jack-up points or place the front or rear
wheels on the rollers of the braking force tester.
2. Release the parking brake, and feel the drag force (drag
torque) on each road wheel. When using the braking force
tester, take a reading of the brake drag force.
