13A-432 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <2.4L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 3. Check the backup power supply voltage at ECM
harness side connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM harness side
connector C-54 <A/T>.
(1) Disconnect the ECM connector C-60 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-54 <A/T> and measure at the harness side.
(2) Measure the voltage between terminal 80 <M/T> or 66 <A/
<M/T>
T> and ground.
• Voltage should be battery positive voltage.
Q:Is the voltage normal?
YES : Go to Step 4.

9291908988878685848382 NO : Check connector C-07 at intermediate connector for
damage, and repair or replace as required. Refer to
C-60 HARNESS
SIDE CONNECTOR GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection P.00E-
2. If intermediate connector are in good condition,
AK000403AC repair harness wire between relay box (9) and ECM
connector C-60 (terminal 80) <M/T> or PCM
<A/T>
connector C-54 (terminal 66) <A/T> because of open
C-54 HARNESS circuit or short circuit to ground. Then go to Step 6.
