52B-102 SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS)
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• Improper engaged connector or defective short
bar*
• Short circuit between the left-side air bag module
(squib) circuit terminals
• Damaged connector(s)
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
NOTE: *: The squib circuit connectors integrate a "short" bar (which prevents the air bag from deploying
unintentionally due to static electricity by shorting the positive wire to the ground wire in the squib circuit when
the connectors are disconnected) (Refer to P.52B-3.) Therefore, if connector C-74 or D-15 is damaged or
improperly engaged, the short bar may not be released when the connector is connected.
