POWER STEERING 37A-5
POWER STEERING DIAGNOSIS
STEP 2. Check the steering wheel free play.
(1) With engine running (hydraulic operation), set front wheels
straight ahead.
(2) Measure the play on steering wheel circumference before
wheels start to move when slightly moving the steering
wheel in both directions.
Limit: 30 mm (1.2 inch)
(3) If the free play exceeds the limit value, set steering wheel
straight ahead with engine stopped. Load approximately 5
N (1.1 pound) toward steering circumference and check
AC000987 play.
Standard value (steering wheel play with engine
stopped): 10 mm (0.4 inch) or less
Q:Does the play exceed the standard value?
YES : Remove steering gear box (Refer to P.37A-25.) and
check total pinion torque (Refer to P.37A-27.). Then

NO : Go to Step 3.
STEP 3. Check steering wheel play.
Verify that the steering wheel play is not excessive.
Q:Is the steering wheel play excessive?
YES : Repeat to Step 1.
NO : Diagnosis is complete.
INSPECTION PROCEDURE 2: Difficult Steering Wheel Operation (Insufficient Power Assist)
