4. Connect the hand vacuum pump directly to the EGR valve.
EGR VALVE 5. Start the engine and run at idle until warm.
6. The engine idling speed should be rough when a vacuum of
29 kPa (8.7 in Hg) or more is applied to the EGR valve.
7. If engine idles rough, EGR passage is open and the system
is OK. If engine idle is not rough, the EGR passage and the
BLACK valve must be checked for restrictions. Perform the EGR
AKX01318AB valve check. Then repeat the EGR system check.

1. Remove the EGR valve and inspect for sticking, carbon
deposits, etc. If found, clean with a suitable solvent so that
the valve seats correctly.
2. Connect a hand vacuum pump to the EGR valve.
3. Apply 67 kPa (20 in Hg) of vacuum, and check to be sure
that the vacuum is maintained.
