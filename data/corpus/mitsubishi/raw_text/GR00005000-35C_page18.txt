35C-18 TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM (TCL)
TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM (TCL) DIAGNOSIS
.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991223: Harness Set
.
STEP 1. Check the TCL indicator light circuit at the ABS-
ECU connector A-02.
(1) Disconnect the ABS-ECU connector A-02 and measure at
the harness side.
(2) Ground the terminal 13.
A-02 (HARNESS SIDE)
(3) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
Q:Does the TCL indicator light illuminate?
YES : Replace the hydraulic unit (integrated with ABS-ECU)
(Refer to GROUP 35B, Hydraulic Unit P.35B-52.) and
then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 2.
AC000968AB
STEP 2. Check the TCL indicator light bulb.
(1) Remove the combination meter. (Refer to GROUP 54A,
Combination Meter P.54A-105 and P.54A-107.)
(2) Check the TCL indicator light bulb.
Q:Is the TCL indicator light bulb burned out?
YES : Replace the bulb and then go to Step 9.
NO : Go to Step 3.
STEP 3. Check the combination meter for the continuity.
(1) Remove the combination meter. (Refer to GROUP 54A,
Combination Meter P.54A-105.)
(2) Remove the TCL indicator light bulb. (Refer to GROUP
54A, Combination Meter P.54A-107.) Then measure the
resistance between the bulb terminals.
(3) Install the TCL indicator light bulb to the combination meter,
CONNECTOR C-41 and then measure the resistance between the connector C-
41 terminals 43 and 52. The resistance reading at this time
should be much the same as the resistance measured at
step (2).
Q:Are the two resistance values extremely different each
other?
YES : Replace the combination meter (printed circuit board)
and then go to Step 9.
AC004564AB NO (much the same) : Go to Step 4.
