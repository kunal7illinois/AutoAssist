SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) 52B-71
SRS AIR BAG DIAGNOSIS
CIRCUIT OPERATION DTC SET CONDITIONS
• The SRS-ECU judges how severe a collision is • This DTC is set if there is abnormal resistance
by detecting signals from the front air bag analog between the input terminals of the driver’s side air
G-sensor. If the impact is over a predetermined bag module (squib). However, if no DTC resets,
level, the SRS-ECU outputs an ignition signal. At the SRS warning light will be switched off (DTC
this time, if the front air bag safing G-sensor is on, will be retained).
the SRS air bag will inflate.
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
• The ignition signal is input to the air bag module
• Malfunction of the clock spring
via the clock spring to inflate the air bag.
• Damaged harness wires and connectors
• Short to the ground in the driver’s air bag module
(squib) harness
• Malfunction of the SRS-ECU
.
DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tools:
• MB991502: Scan Tool (MUT-II)
• MB991613: SRS Check Harness
• MB991865: Dummy resister
• MB991866: Resister harness
STEP 1. Check the driver’s air bag module.
(1) Disconnect the negative battery terminal.
(2) Remove the driver(cid:146)s air bag module. (Refer to P.52B-144.)
(3) Connect connector (4) of special tool MB991613 to clock
spring connector C-81.special tool MB991613 to special
MB991613 tool MB991866.
(4) Connect connector (1) of special tool MB991613 to
RESISTANCE (3Ω) connector (2).
(5) Connect terminals 22 to 24, and terminals 23 to 25 of
