STEP 4. Check the power supply voltage at combination
meter harness side connector C-41.
(1) Disconnect the connector C-41 and measure at the harness
side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.

Q:Is the voltage normal?
565554535251504948 47464544434241 YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Check harness connectors C-108 and C-111 at
intermediate connector for damage, and repair or
replace as required. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. If intermediate
connectors are in good condition, repair harness wire
AK000364AC
between ignition switch connector C-87 terminal 2
and combination meter connector C-41 terminal 52
because of open circuit. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.
STEP 5. Check connector C-51 at ECM <M/T> or connector
C-52 at PCM <A/T> for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR : C-51<M/T>, C-52<A/T>
YES : Go to Step 6.
NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
PCM<A/T> ECM<M/T>
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
