CHECKING FUSES
M1001005000044
A blade type fuse has test taps provided to allow checking of
the fuse itself without removing it from the fuse block. The fuse
FUSE BLOCK is okay if the test light comes on when its one lead is connected
to the test taps (one at a time) and the other lead is grounded.
Remember to turn the ignition switch to ON to ensure all cir-
cuits are live.

CAUTIONS IN EVENT OF BLOWN FUSE
When a fuse is blown, there are two probable causes. One is
that it is blown due to flow of current exceeding its rating. The
other is that it is blown due to repeated on/off current flowing
through it. Which of the two causes is responsible can be easily
determined by visual check as described below.
1. Fuse blown due to current exceeding rating
STATE OF FUSE BLOWN DUE TO The illustration shows the state of a fuse blown due to this
OVERCURRENT cause. In this case, do not replace the fuse with a new one
hastily since a current heavy enough to blow the fuse has
flowed through it. First, check the circuit for shorts and check
for abnormal electric parts. After correcting shorts or
replacing parts, use only a fuse of the same capacity as a
replacement. Never use a fuse of larger capacity than the
original fuse. If a larger capacity fuse is used, electric parts
or wiring could be damaged, or could start a fire.
