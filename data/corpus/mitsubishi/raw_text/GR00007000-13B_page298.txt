13B-298 MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) <3.0L>
MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 9. Using the oscilloscope, check the injector.
(1) Disconnect the injector connector B-02 <No. 2 cylinder> or
B-06 <No. 4 cylinder> or B-25 <No. 6 cylinder> and
connect the test harness special tool (MB991348)
inbetween. (All terminals should be connected)
(2) Connect the oscilloscope probe to the injector side
OSCILLOSCOPE
INJECTOR connector terminal 2.
CONNECTOR
MB991348 NOTE: When measuring with the ECM or PCM side con-
1 2 nector, connect an oscilloscope probe to the each of the fol-
lowing terminals.
.
• ECM or PCM terminal 9 when checking No. 2 cylinder.
• ECM or PCM terminal 2 when checking No. 4 cylinder.
• ECM or PCM terminal 25 when checking No. 6 cylinder.
(3) Start the engine and run at idle.

(4) Measure the waveform.
NORMAL WAVEFORM
• The waveform should show a normal pattern similar to
the illustration.
A:INJECTOR DRIVE TIME
(5) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
Q:Is the waveform normal?
YES : It can be assumed that this malfunction is intermittent.
Refer to GROUP 00, How to Use Troubleshooting/
Inspection Service Points P.00-6.
A NO : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 10.
AKX01557AB
STEP 10. Test the OBD-II drive cycle.
(1) Carry out a test drive with the drive cycle pattern. Refer to
Procedure 6 − Other Monitor P.13B-6.
(2) Check the diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
Q:Is the DTC P0202, P0204, P0206 is output?
YES : Retry the troubleshooting.
NO : The inspection is complete.
DTC P0300: Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire Detected
. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
Random Misfire Circuit
• Refer to DTC P0201, P0203, P0205 − Injector • If a misfire occurs while the engine is running, the
engine speed changes for an instant.
Circuit P.13B-283.
• Refer to DTC P0202, P0204, P0206 − Injector • The ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> checks for such
changes in engine speed.
Circuit P.13B-292.
