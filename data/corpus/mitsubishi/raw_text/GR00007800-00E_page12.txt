HOW TO DIAGNOSE
2. Fuse blown due to repeated turning current on and off
STATE OF FUSE BLOWN DUE TO The illustration shows the state of a fuse blown due to
THERMAL FATIGUE
repeated current on/off. Normally, this type of problem
occurs after a fairly long period of use and is less frequent
than above. In this case, simply replace with a new fuse of
the same capacity.

CABLES AND WIRES CHECK
M1001005100041
1. Check connections for looseness, rust, and stains.
2. Check terminals and wires for corrosion by battery
electrolyte, etc.
3. Check terminals and wires for open circuit or impending
open circuit.
4. Check wire insulation and coating for damage, cracks, and
wear.
5. Check conductive parts of terminals for contact with other
metallic parts (vehicle body and other parts).

6. Check grounding parts to verify that there is complete
continuity between attaching bolt(s) and vehicle body.
7. Check for incorrect wiring.
8. Check that harnesses are secured to prevent contact with
sharp edges and corners or hot parts (exhaust manifold,
pipe, etc.).
9. Check that harnesses are secured firmly to provide enough
clearance from the fan pulley, fan belt, and other rotating or
moving parts.
10.Check that the harness between fixed parts (such as the
ACX00955AB
vehicle body) and vibrating parts (such as the engine) are
long enough to allow for vibration and movement.
BATTERY HANDLING
M1001005200048
WARNING
Battery posts, terminals and related accessories con-
tain lead and lead compounds. WASH HANDS AFTER
HANDLING.
When checking or servicing does not require power from the
vehicle battery, be sure to disconnect the cable from the battery
(−) terminal. This will prevent problems that could be caused by
a short circuit. Disconnect the (−) battery terminal first and
reconnect it last.
