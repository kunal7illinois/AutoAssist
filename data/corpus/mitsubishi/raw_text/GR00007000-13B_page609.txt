MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
. • Improper connector contact, open circuit or short-
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS (The most likely
circuited harness wire.
causes for this code to be set are:)
• Malfunction of the ignition switch. • Disconnected ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T> ground
• Malfunction of the MFI relay. wire.
• Malfunction of the ECM <M/T> or PCM <A/T>.
DIAGNOSIS
STEP 1. Check connector A-18X at MFI relay for damage.
Q:Is the connector in good condition?
CONNECTOR: A-18X
YES : Go to Step 2.
MFI RELAY NO : Repair or replace it. Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness
Connector Inspection P.00E-2. Then confirm that the
malfunction symptom is eliminated.

STEP 2. Check the MFI relay.
(1) Remove the MFI relay.
CONNECTOR: A-18X

(2) Check for continuity between the MFI relay terminals 2 and
3.
• There should be continuity. (approximately 70 Ω)
(3) Use jumper wires to connect MFI relay terminal 2 to the
1 2 positive battery terminal and terminal 3 to the negative
3 4 battery terminal.
