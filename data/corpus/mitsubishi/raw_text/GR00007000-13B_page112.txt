MULTIPORT FUEL INJECTION (MFI) DIAGNOSIS
STEP 5. Check for open circuit and harness damage
between throttle position sensor connector B-07 terminal 1
and ECM connector C-58 terminal 49 <M/T> or PCM
connector C-55 terminal 57 <A/T>.
Q:Is the harness wire in good condition?
CONNECTOR : B-07
YES : Replace the ECM or PCM. Then go to Step 8.
NO : Repair it. Then go to Step 8.

STEP 6. Check the throttle position sensor.
(1) Disconnect the connector B-07.

(2) Measure the resistance between throttle position sensor
side connector terminal 1 and 4.

(3) Measure resistance between the throttle position sensor
1 2 3 4 side connector terminal 1 and 3.
(4) Move the throttle valve from the idle position to the full-open
position.
• Resistance should change smoothly in proportion to the
opening angle of the throttle valve.

Q:Is the resistance normal?
YES : Go to Step 7.
NO : Replace the throttle position sensor. Refer to P.13B-
690, Throttle Body. Then go to Step 8.
