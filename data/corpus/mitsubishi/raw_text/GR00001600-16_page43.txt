Point C:
Number of vibrations at beginning of dwell section (Refer to
Abnormal Waveform Example 5)
NUMBER OF VIBRATIONS COIL

Except above Abnormal
Point D:
Ignition voltage height (distribution per each cylinder) shows
the following trends.

ABNORMAL WAVEFORMS EXAMPLES
Example 1
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is high and short.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is too large.
AKX00280
Example 2
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is low and long, and is sloping. Also, the second
half of the spark line is distorted. This could be a result
of misfiring.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is too small.
AKX00281
Example 3
• Wave characteristics
Spark line is low and long, and is sloping. However, there is
almost no spark line distortion.
• Cause of problem
Spark plug gap is fouled.
