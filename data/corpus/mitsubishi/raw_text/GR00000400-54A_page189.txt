is difficult.
Q: Is the noise level worse than other radios?
YES : Consult a service center. Noise
encountered during FM reception only. Due
to differences in FM and AM systems, FM is
not as susceptible as AM to interference
from engines, power lines, lighting, etc. On
the other hand, due to the characteristics of
FM waves, there are sometimes cases of
noise or distortion which are generated by
typical noise interference (first fading and
multipath). (Refer to Inspection Procedure
8.) <Noise (hissing) occurs in weak signal
areas such as mountainous regions, but this
is not due to Furthermore, the amount of
interference will be comparatively less for
vehicles equipped with a diversity antenna
system*. If there is an equivalent amount of
distortion in vehicles or radios of the same
type, then differences will be because of
differences in antenna systems, and this
should be explained to the user. a problem

NO : f the noise level is roughly the same as
other radios, there is no action to be taken.
