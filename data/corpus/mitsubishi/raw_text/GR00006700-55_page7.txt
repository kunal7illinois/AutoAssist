MANUAL A/C DIAGNOSIS
STEP 4. Check the magnetic clutch operation.
Connect the battery (+) terminal to the compressor magnetic
<2.4L ENGINE> clutch connector terminal 1; <2.4L engine>/terminal 4; <3.0L
MAGNETIC CLUTCH engine>, and ground the battery (−) terminal to the body of the
CONNECTOR
compressor.
Q:Can the sound of the magnetic clutch (click) be heard?
YES : Go to Step 5.
NO : Replace. Then go to Step 11.

STEP 5. Check the dual pressure switch operation.
(1) Remove the dual pressure switch connector and connect
HIGH/LOW the high/low pressure side terminals located on the harness
PRESSURE SIDE
side as shown in the illustration.
(2) Install a gauge manifold to the high-pressure side service
valve of the refrigerant line. (Refer to P.55-26.)
(3) When the high/low pressure sides of the dual pressure
switch are at operation pressure (ON) and the resistance is
less than 2 ohm between the respective terminals, then the
condition is normal. If open loop, replace the switch.
