ENGINE AND EMISSION CONTROL 17-33
AUTO-CRUISE CONTROL
CIRCUIT OPERATION .
DTC SET CONDITIONS
This circuit judges the signals of each switch ("OFF,"
This code is output when the auto-cruise control
"SET," "RESUME," "CANCEL" and "MAIN") of the
switch "RESUME" switch, "SET" switch or "CAN-
auto-cruise control switch.
CEL" switch stays ON.
The auto-cruise control-ECU detects the state of the
auto-cruise control switch by sensing the voltages
.
TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS
shown below.
The most likely causes for this code to be set are:
• When all switches are OFF, the ECU detects 3.5
• Malfunction of the auto-cruise control switch.
− 5.0 volts.
• Malfunction of the clock spring.
• When the "SET" switch is ON, the ECU detects
• Damaged harness or connector.
0.4 − 2.3 volts.
• Malfunction of the auto-cruise control-ECU.
• When the "RESUME" switch is ON, the ECU
detects 2.3 − 3.5 volts.
• When the "CANCEL" switch is ON, the ECU
detects 0.4 volts or less.
• When the main switch is ON, the ECU detects 7.0
volts.

DIAGNOSIS
Required Special Tool:
• MB991223: Harness Set
STEP 1. Check the 12-Volt supply circuit voltage at auto-
cruise control switch connector C-82 (terminal number 1).
(1) Disconnect auto-cruise control switch connector C-82 and
measure at the harness side.
(2) Turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position.
(3) Measure the voltage between terminal 1 and ground.
AUTO-CRUISE
CONTROL SWITCH (4) Turn the ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position.
CONNECTOR: C-82
Q:Is the voltage approximately battery positive voltage?
YES : Go to Step 6.
3 2 1
NO : Go to Step 2.
ACX02255AE
STEP 2. Check auto-cruise control switch connector C-82.
Q:Is the connector damaged?
CONNECTORS: C-82
YES : Repair or replace connector.
CLOCK SPRING Refer to GROUP 00E, Harness Connector Inspection
P.00E-2.
Then check that diagnostic trouble code 15 is not
output.
NO : Go to Step 3.
