(2) Measure the valve stem end outer diameter using micrometer.
Standard value (intake): 5.455 to 5.470 mm
{0.21476 to 0.21535 in}
Standard value (exhaust): 5.445 to 5.460 mm
{0.21437 to 0.21496 in}
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of
20°C{68°F}.
• Measure the outer diameter of the valve stem end at the two
locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of most
A278794
worn location.
EM • If it is not within the specified value, replace the valve with a
new part.
• When the valve is replaced, lap the valve.
(3) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inner diameter of valve
adjusting shim.
Standard value: 5.500 to 5.560 mm {0.21654 to 0.21890 in}
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• Measure the inner diameter of the valve adjusting shim at the
two locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of
most worn location.
• If it is not within the standard value, replace the valve adjusting
A278780
shim.
• If the valve adjusting shim has to be replaced, check the valve
clearance and replace with the suitable valve adjusting shim.
(4) Calculate the clearance between valve and valve adjusting shim.
Standard value: 0.030 to 0.115 mm {0.00118 to 0.00453 in}
<Reference>
• Valve adjusting shim clearance = Valve adjusting shim inner dia. - Valve stem end outer dia.
• If it exceeds the standard, replace the valve or valve adjusting shim, whichever shows the greater amount of wear or
damage.
• When the valve is replaced, lap the valve.
• If the valve adjusting shim has to be replaced, check the valve clearance and replace with the suitable valve adjusting
shim.
6. Inspection of intake valve seat
(1) Check the valve seat for damage and deformation.
(2) Clean the valve and valve seat.
(3) Apply a thin coat of engine oil to the valve stem, and apply red dye
evenly on the valve face.

(4) Slowly insert the valve applied with red dye into the valve guide bushing, lightly press the valve against the valve seat
without turning the valve, and then slowly pull out the valve.
(5) Check the seating width of valve seat as shown in the figure, using a caliper gauge.
