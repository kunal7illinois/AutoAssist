(3) Using a caliper, measure the thickness of the valve head.
Captions in illustration
*a Thickness
Standard value: 1.0 to 1.4 mm {0.039 to 0.055 in}
<Reference>
• It is possible to differentiate between the intake valve and the
exhaust valve by their overall length.
• If it is not within the specified value, replace the valve with a
(cid:12)(cid:67) new part.
A121379J06 • When the valve is replaced, lap the valve.
(4) Check the valve stem outer diameter using micrometer. EM
Standard value: 5.445 to 5.460 mm {0.21437 to 0.21496 in}
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• Measure the outer diameter of the valve stem at the six
locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of most
worn location.
• If it is not within the specified value, replace the valve with a
new part.
A121381
• When the valve is replaced, lap the valve.
4. Inspection of valve guide bushing oil clearance
(1) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inner diameter of valve guide
bushing.
Standard value: 5.500 to 5.512 mm {0.21654 to 0.21701 in}
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• Measure the inner diameter of the valve guide bushing at the
six locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of most
worn location.
• If it is not within the standard value, replace the valve guide
bushing.
(2) Calculate the oil clearance between valve and valve guide
bushing.
Standard value (intake): 0.030 to 0.057 mm
{0.00118 to 0.00224 in}
Standard value (exhaust): 0.040 to 0.067 mm
{0.00157 to 0.00264 in}
<Reference>
• Oil clearance = valve guide bushing inner dia. - Valve stem
outer dia.
A278774
• If the clearance between valve and valve guide bushing
exceeds the standard, replace the valve or valve guide,
whichever shows the greater amount of wear or damage.
• When the valve is replaced, lap the valve.
5. Inspection of valve adjusting shim clearance
(1) Visually check the valve adjusting shim for any damage.
