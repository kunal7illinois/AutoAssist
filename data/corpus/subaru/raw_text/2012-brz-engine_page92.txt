• It is possible to differentiate between the intake valve and the
exhaust valve by their overall length.
• If it is not within the specified value, replace the valve with a
(cid:12)(cid:67) new part.
A121379J06 • When the valve is replaced, lap the valve.
(4) Check the valve stem outer diameter using micrometer.
Standard value: 5.455 to 5.470 mm {0.2148 to 0.2154 in}
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• Measure the outer diameter of the valve stem at the six
locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of most
worn location.
• If it is not within the specified value, replace the valve with a
A121381 new part.
• When the valve is replaced, lap the valve.
3. Inspection of exhaust valve
(1) Check the valve flange and stem for damage, wear or deformation.
(2) Using a caliper, measure the whole length of the valve.
