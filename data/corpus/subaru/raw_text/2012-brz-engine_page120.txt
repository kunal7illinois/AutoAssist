11. Inspection of ring closed gap
(1) Using the piston, set the piston ring into cylinder liner at a right
angle.

Press down into the cylinder liner until the ring gets in down to the
crown of the piston.

(2) Measure the closed gap of the piston ring using a thickness gauge.
Standard value
No. 1 0.20 to 0.25mm {0.00784 to 0.00984in}
No. 2 0.60 to 0.70mm {0.02362 to 0.02756in}
Oil 0.10 to 0.35mm {0.00394 to 0.01378in}
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• If it is not within the standard value, replace the piston ring.
A279405
• Use piston ring with same size as piston when replacing piston
ring.
12. Inspection of clearance piston ring and ring groove
(1) Fit the piston ring straight into the piston ring groove, then check
the clearance between piston ring and piston using a thickness
gauge.
Standard value
No. 1 0.030 to 0.080mm {0.00118 to 0.00315in}
No. 2 0.030 to 0.070mm {0.00118 to 0.00276in}
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
A279515
{68°F}.
• Before inspecting the clearance, clean the piston ring groove
and piston ring.
• If it is not within the standard value, replace the piston ring.
• Use piston ring with same size as piston when replacing piston
ring.
13. Inspection of connecting rod ASSY
(1) Check that the large or small end thrust surface of each connecting rod is not damaged.
(2) Check each connecting rod bearing for scar, peeling, seizure, melting or wear, etc.
