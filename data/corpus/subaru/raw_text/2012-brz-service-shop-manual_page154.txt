A: INSPECTION
1) Check that the amount of brake fluid is between the lines of “MIN” and “MAX” from a straight view or within
90° to the right and left forward.
If out of the specified range, refill with brake fluid or drain the fluid.
If the brake fluid level is close to “MIN”, check the brake pad for wear and refill with brake fluid.
2) Check the fluid for discoloration. If the fluid is extremely discolored, replace with the new fluid.
B: REPLACEMENT
CAUTION:
• Do not let brake fluid come into contact with the painted surface of the vehicle body. Wash away
with water immediately and wipe off if it is spilled by accident.
• Avoid mixing brake fluid of different brands to prevent fluid performance from degrading.
• Be careful not to allow dirt or dust to enter the reservoir tank.
NOTE:
• During the operation, keep the reservoir tank filled with brake fluid to prevent entry of air.
• Operate the brake pedal slowly.
• For convenience and safety, perform the work with 2 people.
1) Lift up the vehicle and set rigid racks at the specified locations, or keep the vehicle lifted.
2) Remove both the front and rear wheels.
3) Drain brake fluid from the reservoir tank.
