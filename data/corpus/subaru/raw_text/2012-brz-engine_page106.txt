(2) Slowly insert the valve applied with the valve compound into the
valve guide bushing, and lap the seating surface between valve
and valve seat.
<Reference>
• First, lift the valve and strike it against the valve seat twice, and
then slightly turn the valve once. Repeat these steps as one
set.
• To prevent the seating width between valve and valve seat from
exceeding the standard value, be careful not to keep turning
the valve while pressing it against the valve seat during
lapping.
EM • Be careful not to lift the valve too far during lapping in order to
prevent the valve from coming off the valve guide bushing.
(3) Wipe off the valve compound on the valve and valve seat
completely after lapping.
<Caution>
Be careful not to leave any valve compound in order to avoid
malfunction.
(4) Check the seating width and seating position between valve and
valve seat.
