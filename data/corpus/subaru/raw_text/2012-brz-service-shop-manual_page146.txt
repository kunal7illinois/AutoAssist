(6) After changing to oil pressure adjustment mode, switch to the “P” range.
(7) Remove the short of data link connectors No. 13 and No. 4.
(8) Check the status of the upshift/downshift permitted indicator lamps [ ]/[ ].
CAUTION:
If only the [ ] indicator lamp is illuminated or both [ ] and [ ] are illuminated simultaneously, stop
performing procedures and leave the vehicle in a cool location. Start over and repeat procedures
from Step (1) after the ATF temperature decreases to a point where only the downshift permitted in-
dicator lamp [ ] when shifting to oil amount adjustment mode.
(9) Adjust the oil as soon as the proper temperature for oil amount adjustment is reached.
CAUTION:
Always be sure to adjust the ATF when at the proper temperature.
Lower than proper temperature Proper temperature Higher than proper temperature
[ ] and [ ] indicator lamps are illumi-

3) Remove the overflow plug and check the oil amount when at the proper temperature for oil amount inspec-
tion.
• The oil amount is proper when fluid flows out of the overflow tube and then the flow of the fluid is thin.
• If fluid does not flow out of the overflow tube, fill through the refill hole until fluid flows out of the overflow
tube. The oil amount is proper when the flow of the fluid is thin.

4) Install the overflow plug using a new gasket.
CAUTION:
Tighten the overflow plug with the ATF temperature at (43°C — 47°C (109.4°F — 116.6°F) (indicator
lamps [ ] and [ ] are illuminated simultaneously).
Tightening torque:
20 N·m (2.1 kgf-m, 27.3 ft-lb)
5) Perform final tightening of the refill plug using a new O-ring.
Tightening torque:
39 N·m (4.0 kgf-m, 27.3 ft-lb)
6) Install engine under cover No. 2.
Tightening torque:
