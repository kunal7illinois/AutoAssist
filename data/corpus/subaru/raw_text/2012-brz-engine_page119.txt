Engine mechanical - Cylinder block ASSY (FA20)
<Reference>
Inspection should be performed at a temperature of 20°C {68°F}.
8. Inspection of connecting rod small end bushing
(1) Check that the connecting rod small end bushing is not damaged.
9. Inspection of piston pin oil clearance
(1) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inner diameter of piston pin
hole.
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• Measure the inner diameter of the piston pin hole at the four
EM
locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of most
worn location.
• Record the measured value.

(2) Check the piston pin outer diameter at the position shown in the
figure using a micrometer.
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.

(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:75)(cid:80)(cid:11) • Measure the outer diameter of the piston pin at the four
locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of most
(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:79)(cid:79) worn location.
(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:75)(cid:80)(cid:11) • Record the measured value.

(3) Using a caliper gauge, measure the inner diameter of connecting
rod bushing.
<Reference>
• Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• Measure the inner diameter of the connecting rod bushing at
the two locations as shown in the figure, and read the value of
most worn location.
• Record the measured value.
(4) Calculate the clearance between piston and piston pin.
Standard value: 0.004 to 0.008mm {0.00016 to 0.00031in}
<Reference>
• Oil clearance = Piston pin hole inner dia. - Piston pin outer dia.
• If it is not within the standard, replace the piston and piston pin
as a set.
A281040 (5) Calculate the clearance between piston pin and connecting rod
bushing.
Standard value: 0.006 to 0.026mm {0.00024 to 0.00102in}
<Reference>
• Oil clearance = Connecting rod bushing inner dia. - Piston pin
outer dia.
• If the clearance between piston pin and connecting rod bushing
is not within the standard, replace the connecting rod and
piston pin as a set.
10. Inspection of piston ring
(1) Make sure the piston ring is not broken or damaged.
<Reference>
• If damaged, replace the piston ring.
• Use piston ring with same size as piston when replacing piston ring.
