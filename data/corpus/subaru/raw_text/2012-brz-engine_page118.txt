4. Inspection of piston outer diameter
(1) Set a micrometer at 39.4 mm {1.551 in} from the upper face of
piston skirt, and then measure the diameter at a right angle to the
pin hole.

<Reference>
EM • Measurement should be performed at a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
• Measure the outer diameter of each piston in thrust direction at
the height as shown in the figure.
• If it is not within the specified value, replace the piston.
• Standard sized pistons are classified into two grades, (A) and
(B).These grades should be used as guide lines in selecting a
standard piston.
• If the piston is replaced, check the clearance between cylinder
liner and piston and select a suitable sized piston.
5. Inspection of piston oil clearance
(1) Calculate the oil clearance from the inner diameter of cylinder liner and the outer diameter of piston.
Standard value: 0.010 to 0.030mm {0.00039 to 0.0018in}
<Reference>
• Oil clearance = Cylinder maximum inner dia. - Piston outer dia.
• If it is not within the standard, perform boring and honing, or replace the cylinder block and piston as a set.
6. Correction of cylinder liner
(1) If any of the inner diameter, taper, out-of-roundness or clearance between cylinder liner and piston is out of standard or if
there is any damage on the cylinder liner, rebore it to replace with an oversize piston.
Boring limit: 86.505 mm {3.40570in} (inner diameter of cylinder liner)
<Reference>
• When any of the cylinder liner needs reboring, all other cylinder liners must be bored at the same time, and replaced
with oversize pistons.
• If the inner diameter of cylinder liner exceeds the limit after boring and honing, replace the cylinder block and piston
as a set.
• Immediately after reboring, the inner diameter of cylinder liner may differ from its real diameter due to temperature
rise.Thus, when measuring the inner diameter of cylinder liner, wait until it has cooled to a temperature of 20°C
{68°F}.
7. Inspection of piston with pin
(1) Check the piston and piston pin for wear or crack.
(2) Check the piston hole snap ring for distortion or wear.
(3) Check the piston ring groove for damage.
(4) Check the groove for burr.

(5) Check that the piston pin can be inserted into the piston with a thumb.
