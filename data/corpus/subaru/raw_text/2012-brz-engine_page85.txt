EM–76
Engine mechanical - Partial engine ASSY (FA20)
56. Installation of oil filter union
(1) Install the oil filter union.
Standard value: T=45N•m {459kgf•cm} {33.2 ft•lbf}
A281050
57. Installation of oil filter SUB-ASSY EM
(1) Apply a little coat of engine oil to the seal rubber portion of a new oil filter SUB-ASSY.
(2) Tighten the oil filter SUB-ASSY by hand.
<Caution>
Be careful not to damage the seal rubber of the oil filter SUB-ASSY.
(3) Using SST, tighten the oil filter SUB-ASSY.
SST 18332AA020
Standard value: Specified tightening torque
T=14N•m {143kgf•cm} {10.3 ft•lbf}
When using SST, calculate the following formula.
Calculation T2 = L2/(L1 + L2) × T1
T1 14 N•m {143 kgf•cm, 10.3 ft•lbf}
T2 Tightening torque
L1 SST length (0.080 m {3.150 in})
L2 Torque wrench length (m)
<Reference>
• This torque is valid when SST and a torque wrench are aligned.
• Install SST and a torque wrench so that they are aligned.
58. Installation of oil filler cap SUB-ASSY
(1) Install the oil filler cap SUB-ASSY.
