(4) Align the oil ring side rail (upper) gap to position (C) (0 to 20°) in the figure and engage the upper turn stopper to the oil
ring expander.
(5) Using a piston ring tool, install compression ring No. 2 and then, compression ring No. 1in numerical order with a
stamped mark upward.
(6) Set the gap of compression ring No. 1 to the position (A) or (B) in
(cid:19)(cid:26)(cid:18)(cid:113)
the figure.
<Reference>
Either (A) or (B) is good for compression ring No. 1 if it points in the
