5. REMOVED PART
• A removed part must be organized to avoid mixing up with similar parts. When same parts are used in mul-
tiple locations, such as pistons in engine, manage the parts by using labels with cylinder No. so that the parts
are not installed to the wrong location.
• Always replace nonreusable parts such as gasket and O-ring with new parts.
• After work, have a customer confirm the replaced part.
