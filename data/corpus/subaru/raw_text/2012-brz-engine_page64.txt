EM–55
Engine mechanical - Partial engine ASSY (FA20)
A281474
EM Standard value (when cold): 0.10 to 0.16 mm {0.0039 to 0.0063 in} (intake side)
0.21 to 0.27 mm {0.0083 to 0.0106 in} (exhaust side)
<Reference>
• For valve clearance inspection, adjust the cam base circle position so that the thickness gauge can be inserted easily
by hand turning the camshaft to be measured.
• If the measured value is out of standard, take notes of the value in order to adjust the valve clearance later on.
25. Valve clearance adjustment (bank 1 side)
(1) Remove the camshaft housing SUB-ASSY RH.
(2) Remove the valve rocker arm SUB-ASSY No. 1.
(3) Remove the valve adjusting shim.
(4) Measure the thickness of the removed valve adjusting shim using
micrometer.

(5) Calculate the thickness of the valve adjusting shim so that the valve clearance is within the specified range.
Standard value: Intake side: (Selected shim thickness) = (removed shim thickness) + [(measured clearance) -
0.13 mm {0.0051 in}] × 1.54
Exhaust side: (Selected shim thickness) = (removed shim thickness) + [(measured clearance) -
0.24 mm {0.0094 in}] × 1.69
(6) Apply engine oil to the inner circle area of the selected valve adjusting shim, and install to the valve.
<Caution>
Make sure that the valve adjusting shim turns smoothly after inserting.
(7) Install the valve rocker arm SUB-ASSY No. 1.
(8) Install the camshaft housing SUB-ASSY RH.
26. Installation of cylinder head cover SUB-ASSY
(1) Apply a light coat of engine oil to the two new spark plug tube
(cid:12)(cid:67) gaskets, and insert them up to the spark plug tube end.
