Engine mechanical - Partial engine ASSY (FA20)
(4) Measure the thickness of the removed valve adjusting shim using
micrometer.
A281710
EM (5) Calculate the thickness of the valve adjusting shim so that the valve clearance is within the specified range.
Standard value: Intake side: (Selected shim thickness) = (removed shim thickness) + [(measured clearance) -
0.13mm {0.0051in}] × 1.54
Exhaust side: (Selected shim thickness) = (removed shim thickness) + [(measured clearance) -
0.24mm {0.0094in}] × 1.69
(6) Apply engine oil to the inner circle area of the selected valve adjusting shim, and install to the valve.
<Caution>
Make sure that the valve adjusting shim turns smoothly after inserting.
(7) Install the valve rocker arm SUB-ASSY No. 1.
(8) Install the camshaft housing SUB-ASSY LH.
