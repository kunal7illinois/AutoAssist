16.HANDLING PRECAUTIONS FOR SILICON-CONTAINING SPRAY
When a silicone contained in the lubricant, rust inhibitor or glazing agent adheres to the electrical contact of
the relay or switch, nonconducting silica dioxide (SiO ) film will be formed, which may lead to poor continuity.

Therefore, the following precautions must be observed when using the silicon-containing spray.
• Never spray directly to the electrical equipment.
• When using the spray close to the electrical equipment, always put the cover on it. Be sure to put the cover
on the electrical equipment especially when using the spray to the locations shown in the figure below and
their surrounding areas.

• If the residual silicon remains in the vicinity of the electrical equipment after the spray has been used, the
vaporized silicon stands around the electrical equipment and it may adhere to electrical contact. After using
the spray, be sure to wipe the silicon off with a cloth.
• Even when using the spray to the place away from the electrical equipment, the droplet of the spray may
be splashed to the periphery. Use as small amount of spray as possible, and take care not to splash the sil-
icon to the periphery.
NOTE:
The “silicon” used in this section refers to “silicone”, that is, silicon polymer.
