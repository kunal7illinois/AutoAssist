(6) While measuring the protrusion amount shown in the figure using
a caliper gauge, tap in the valve guide bushing within the range of
the standard.

*a Protrusion amount
Specified protrusion amount: 11.4 to 11.8 mm {0.449 to 0.466 in}
<Caution>
• During work, place a cloth, etc. to avoid scratching the mating
surface of the cylinder head.
• Use special care not to damage the cylinder head during work.

(7) Place the cylinder head on a wooden piece etc facing the combustion chamber upward.
<Caution>
• Place a wooden piece wrapped with a cloth to stabilize the cylinder head before work.
• Use special care not to damage the cylinder head during work.
(8) Using a hand reamer and pin vise, grind the inner surface of the
valve guide bushing so that the oil clearance is within the specified
value.
Standard value: 5.500 to 5.512 mm {0.21654 to 0.21701 in}
(20°C {68°F})
<Caution>
By widening the hole slowly and evenly using a hand reamer, grind so
that it is within the specified value.
<Reference>
• Apply engine oil to a hand reamer.
• If the inner surface of valve guide bushing is damaged, the
edge of the hand reamer should be slightly ground with an
abrasive sheet (No. 400).
• If the inner surface of valve guide bushing becomes lustrous
and the hand reamer does not chip, use a new hand reamer or
A281465 remedy the hand reamer.
(9) After reaming, clean the valve guide bushing to remove chips.
(10)Using a caliper gauge, measure the inner diameter of valve guide bushing to calculate the oil clearance between the
valve and valve guide bushing.
(11)Check the seating width between valve and valve seat.
2. Installation of exhaust valve guide bushing No. 2
(1) Before installing the valve guide bushing, make sure that neither scratches nor damages exist on the inner surface of
valve guide bushing installation holes of cylinder head.
(2) Draw a reference line for insert on the new valve guide bushing at
the position shown in the figure using a marker.
