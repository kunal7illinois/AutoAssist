28. Operation for prevention of piston and valve from damage
(1) Using SST and by turning the crankshaft approximately 200°
(cid:12)(cid:19)
clockwise, align the alignment marks of crankshaft timing gear/
sprocket to the positions as shown in the figure.
Captions in illustration
*1 Alignment mark
(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:113)
SST 18252AA000
<Caution>
Never turn counterclockwise except to fine-adjust the alignment mark
A279534J01 because the valve and piston may contact.
(2) Using SST and by turning the camshaft timing intake gear ASSY EM
LH by approximately 180°, align the alignment marks of camshaft
(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:2) timing intake gear ASSY LH to the positions (zero-lift position) as
shown in the figure.

*1 Alignment mark
SST 18355AA000, 18334AA030
<Caution>
After this work, when the intake valve and exhaust valve lift at the
same time, the valve heads may contact each other and valve stem
may bend. Do not turn the intake camshaft LH and exhaust camshaft
LH to the outside of range of zero-lift (in range where it can be turned
lightly by hand).
(cid:53)(cid:53)(cid:54)
(3) Remove SST from the crankshaft.

29. Removal of crankshaft timing gear/sprocket
(1) Remove the crankshaft timing gear/sprocket.

30. Removal of camshaft timing intake gear ASSY RH
(1) Fix the camshaft timing intake gear ASSY RH using SST to
remove the three bolts.
