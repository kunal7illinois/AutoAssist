18. Valve clearance check (bank 2 side)
<Caution>
Under the condition that the chain SUB-ASSY (bank 2 side) is detached, the valve heads contact each other and valve stem may
bend. Do not turn the intake camshaft LH and exhaust camshaft LH to the outside of range of zero-lift (in range where it can be
turned lightly by hand).
(1) Measure the roller surface of cam base circle and valve rocker arm SUB-ASSY No.1 using thickness gauge.

Standard value (when cold): 0.10 to 0.16 mm {0.0039 to 0.0063 in} (intake side)
0.21 to 0.27 mm {0.0083 to 0.0106 in} (exhaust side)
<Reference>
• For valve clearance inspection, adjust the cam base circle position so that the thickness gauge can be inserted easily
by hand turning the camshaft to be measured.
• If the measured value is out of standard, take notes of the value in order to adjust the valve clearance later on.
19. Valve clearance adjustment (bank 2 side)
(1) Remove the camshaft housing SUB-ASSY LH.
(2) Remove the valve rocker arm SUB-ASSY No. 1.
